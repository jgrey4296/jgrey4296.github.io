As a friend on private said: if you want to know if someone is actually in any meaningful way
interested in liberation or a just society, get them to talk about children.

It's such a good barometer of people's true politics, because so many who
otherwise profess the "right" beliefs will pivot to
speaking of children with such sneering disgust it's actually frightening.
