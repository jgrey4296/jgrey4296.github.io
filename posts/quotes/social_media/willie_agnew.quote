Most discussions were rooted in the view that Al is here and educators must repond, rather than
asking what Al can do for education, and demanding Al not be a negative. I want to believe this is
possible, and I was inspired by the work of the one K12 teacher I met there.

However, much of the other discussion was disheartening, from the ed tech representative
refering to educators pushing back on LLM adoption as "problem teachers" to the guy from CMU
that straight up said "fuck what educators think".

Educators--don't let technologists and espeically tech billionaires sell you what the future of
education is! We should be adapting our field to your needs, not vice versa.
