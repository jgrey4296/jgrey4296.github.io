Iâ€™ve seen this happen in other contexts. You need an ecosystem, not an expert.

[quote @chrisalbon]:
A mistake I see WAY too many times is hiring some expensive ML expert before having the
infrastructure there to support them. Then they spin their wheels being their own data
Engineer, data scientist, MLOps engineer, etc. etc. until they quit because they aren't training
models.
