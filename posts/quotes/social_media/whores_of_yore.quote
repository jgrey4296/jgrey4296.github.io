The expression “call a spade a spade” comes from the work of Plutarch, who
originally wrote “call a fig a fig & a trough a trough.” Figs & troughs were crude slang
for the Vulva, so what Plutarch meant was “call a c*nt a c*nt”. When Erasmus
(1466-1536) translated Plutarch’s work & changed it to a garden spade to avoid
embarrassment.
