In a conversation on reddit today someone
asked if other languages have phrases like
"rightie tightie, leftie loosie" to remember
which way to turn screws/lids/etc.
And one person answers that in Spanish, the phrase is:
"La derecha oprime, la izquierda libera."
or:
"The right oppresses, the left liberates."

(Now | kind of want to put this on at shirt)
