Racial oppression enabled land exploitation on a massive scale.
During slavery, black slaves pulled profit from the dirt but had no claim to the land.
After the Civil War, freed slaves saw in landownership the possibility of true liberation, but during Reconstruction wealthy whites maintained a virtual monopoly on the soil as lands seized from or abandoned by Confederates were restored to their original owners.
Returning to plantations as sharecroppers, black families descended into a cycle of subsistence farming and debt, while white planters continued to grow rich.
The slave shacks stood, and so did the plantation mansions.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, African-American families seeking freedom and good jobs participated in the Great Migration, moving en masse from the rural South to cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee.
When they arrived in those cities, they were crowded into urban ghettos, and the vast majority depended on landlords for housing.
Ghetto landlords had a segregated and captive tenant base and had nothing to gain by improving their run-down houses.
They began dividing their properties into small "kitchenette" units, throwing up so many plywood walls their apartments resembled "rabbit warrens".
Many houses lacked heating and complete plumbing.
So black families cooked and ate in winter coats and relieved themselves in outhouses or homemade toilets.
They came to know well the sound of the tuberculosis cough.
In 1930, the death rate for Milwaukee's blacks was nearly 60 percent higher than the citywide rate, due in large part to poor housing conditions.
For the first time in the history of America, New Deal policies made homeownership a real possibility for white families.

Maybe it began in the late fifteenth century, the weaponry of war to blame.
With the invention of the iron cannonball, cities could no longer rely on moats and modest ramparts to fend off attack.
Complicated systems of defense had to be constructed and cities had to grow vertically behind high walls. Old Geneva and Paris saw tenements climb six stories.
Edinburgh boasted of tenements twice as high.
While agrarian families were driven from the land to increasingly congested cities, the competition for space drove up land values and rents.
Urban landlords quickly realized that piles of money could be made by creating slums: "maximum profits came, not from providing first-class accommodations for those who could well afford them... but from crowded slum accommodations, for those whose pennies were scarcer than the rich man's pounds."
Beginning in the sixteenth century, slum housing would be reserved not only for outcasts, beggars, and thieves but for a large segment of the population.

During its rapid period of urbanization, America imported this model.
Colonial proprietors adopted the institutions and laws of England's landed gentry, including the doctrine of absolute liability for rent, which held tenants unequivocally responsible for payments even in the event of fire or flood.
Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, America's poor lived in cellars, attics, cattle sheds, and windowless rooms that held multiple families.
Some slums were cut off from basic municipal services and local wells; so families begged for water in other parts of town.
Rents continued to rise as living conditions deteriorated.
Soon, many families could not afford their housing.
