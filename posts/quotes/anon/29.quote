The total word count of the WSC specification catalogue is 114 million
words at the time of writing. If you added the combined word counts of
the C11, C++17, UEFI, USB 3.2, and POSIX specifications, all 8,754
published RFCs, and the combined word counts of everything on
Wikipediaâ€™s list of longest novels, you would be 12 million words short
of the W3C specifications.

I conclude that it is impossible to build a new web browser. The
complexity of the web is obscene. The creation of a new web browser
would be comparable in effort to the Apollo program or the Manhattan

It is impossible to:

- Implement the web correctly
- Implement the web securely
- Implement the web at all
