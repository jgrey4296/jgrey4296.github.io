WHAT KIND OF GIFTS DO YOU GIVE?

I always give books. And I always ask for
books. I think you should reward people
sexually for getting you books. Don’t send a
thank-you note, repay them with sexual
activity. If the book is rare or by your favorite
author or one you didn’t know about, reward
them with the most perverted sex act you can
think of. Otherwise, you can just make out.
