*** Law 11: Learn to Keep People Dependent on You

   To maintain your independence you must always be
   needed and wanted.  The more you are relied on,
   the more freedom you have.  Make people depend on
   you for their happiness and prosperity and you
   have nothing to fear.  Never teach them enough so
   that they can do without you.
