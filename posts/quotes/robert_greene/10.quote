*** Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky

   You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional
   states are as infectious as disease.  You may feel
   you are helping the drowning man but you are only
   precipitating your own disaster.  The unfortunate
   sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will
   also draw it on you.  Associate with the happy and
   fortunate instead.
