*** Law 7: Get others to do the Work for you, but Always Take the Credit

   Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other
   people to further your own cause.  Not only will
   such assistance save you valuable time and energy,
   it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and
   speed.  In the end your helpers will be forgotten
   and you will be remembered.  Never do yourself
   what others can do for you.
