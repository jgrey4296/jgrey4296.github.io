*** Law 48: Assume Formlessness

   By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you
   open yourself to attack.  Instead of taking a form
   for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable
   and on the move.  Accept the fact that nothing is
   certain and no law is fixed.  The best way to
   protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as
   water; never bet on stability or lasting order.
   Everything changes.
