*** Law 9: Win through your Actions, Never through Argument

   Any momentary triumph you think gained through
   argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The
   resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger
   and lasts longer than any momentary change of
   opinion.  It is much more powerful to get others
   to agree with you through your actions, without
   saying a word.  Demonstrate, do not explicate.
