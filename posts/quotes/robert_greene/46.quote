*** Law 46: Never appear too Perfect

   Appearing better than others is always dangerous,
   but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no
   faults or weaknesses.  Envy creates silent
   enemies.  It is smart to occasionally display
   defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to
   deflect envy and appear more human and
   approachable.  Only gods and the dead can seem
   perfect with impunity.
