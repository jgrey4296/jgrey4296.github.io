*** Law 30: Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless

   Your actions must seem natural and executed with
   ease.  All the toil and practice that go into
   them, and also all the clever tricks, must be
   concealed.  When you act, act effortlessly, as if
   you could do much more.  Avoid the temptation of
   revealing how hard you work â€“ it only raises
   questions.  Teach no one your tricks or they will
   be used against you.
