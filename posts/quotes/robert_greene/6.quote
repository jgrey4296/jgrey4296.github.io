*** Law 6: Court Attention at all Cost

   Everything is judged by its appearance; what is
   unseen counts for nothing.  Never let yourself get
   lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion.
   Stand out.  Be conspicuous, at all cost.  Make
   yourself a magnet of attention by appearing
   larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the
   bland and timid masses.
