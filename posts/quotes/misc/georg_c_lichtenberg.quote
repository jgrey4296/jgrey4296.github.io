I ceased in the year 1764 to believe that one can convince oneâ€™s opponents with
arguments printed in books. It is not to do that, therefore, that I have taken
up my pen, but merely so as to annoy them, and to bestow strength and courage on
those on our own side, and to make it known to the others that they have not
convinced us.
