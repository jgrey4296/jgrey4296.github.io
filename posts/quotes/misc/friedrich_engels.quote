"When society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that
they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is quite
as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet;
its deed is murder just a s surely as the deed of the single individual."
- The Condition of the Working Class in England, 1845.
