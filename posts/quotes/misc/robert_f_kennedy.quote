Every time we turn our heads the other way when we see the law flouted,
when we tolerate what we know to be wrong,
when we close our eyes and ears to the corrupt because we are too busy or too frightened,
when we fail to speak up and speak out,
we strike a blow against freedom, decency and justice.
