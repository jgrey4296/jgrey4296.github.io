 “I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ; I therefore
 hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial, and
 hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the
 most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look
 upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the
 grossest of all libels.”
