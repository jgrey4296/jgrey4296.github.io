“The smart way to keep people
passive and obedient is to strictly limit
the spectrum of acceptable opinion,
but allow very lively debate within
that spectrum - even encourage the
more critical and dissident views. That
gives people the sense that there’s
free thinking going on, while all the
time the presuppositions of the system
are being reinforced by the limits put
on the range of the debate.”
