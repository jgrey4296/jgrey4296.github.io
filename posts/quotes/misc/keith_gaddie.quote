But, words are the currency of our humanity.
They make actions.
They define truth and lies,
and give shape to actions in the context of ethics and morality.
They are democracy's greatest asset.
They build the record of our actions,
and signal our intentions.
And, as such, are the most important thing protected in a free society.
