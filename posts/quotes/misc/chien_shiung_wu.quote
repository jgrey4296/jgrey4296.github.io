It is shameful that there are so few women in science in China.
There are many many women in physics.
There is a misconception in America that women scientists are all dowdy spinsters.
This is the fault of men.
In Chinese society, a woman is valued for what she is, and men encourage her to accomplishments
yet she remains eternally feminine.
