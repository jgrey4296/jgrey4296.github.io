"My mission is to lead the country out of a bad situation of corruption,
depression and slavery. After I rid the country of these vices, I will then
organize and supervise a general election of a genuinely democratic civilian
government."

I am the hero of Africa.

Politics is like boxing รณ you try to knock out your opponents.
