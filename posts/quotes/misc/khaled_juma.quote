“Oh rascal children of Gaza. You who
constantly disturbed me with your
screams under my window. You who
filled every morning with rush and
chaos. You who broke my vase and
stole the lonely flower on my balcony.
Come back, and scream as you want
and break all the vases. Steal all the
flowers. Come back..Just come back..”
