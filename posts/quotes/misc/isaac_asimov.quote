“I BELIEVE IN EVIDENCE.

I believe in observation, measurement, and
reasoning, confirmed by independent
observers. I'll believe anything, no matter
how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence
for it. The wilder and more ridiculous
something is, however, the firmer and more
solid the evidence will have to be.”
