To get rid of flies, take off all your clothes and
coat yourself head to toe with a glutinous
liquid, mixed with a little honey or sprinkled
with sugar, then take a slow walk around your
bedroom. The flies flock to you, they stick to
your skin, you can pick them off at your leisure.
As a procedure it may lack elegance, but is
infallible.
