# Summary:

It is not true that in order to live
one has to believe in one's own
existence. There is no necessity to
that. No matter what, our
consciousness is never the echo of
our own reality, of an existence
set in "real time." But rather it is
its echo in "delayed time," the
screen of the dispersion of the
subject and of its identity â€” only
in our sleep, our unconscious, and
our death are we identical to
ourselves.
