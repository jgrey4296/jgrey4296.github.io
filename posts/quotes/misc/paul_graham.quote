# Summary:

"An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not
allowed to implement new ideas, you stop having them. And
vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have
more ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your
brain more powerful in the same way a low-restriction ex-
haust system makes an engine more powerful."
