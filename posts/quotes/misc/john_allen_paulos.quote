It's harder to be a politican than it is to be a scientist, and less fun.
In science, you have to suspend belief, and it has to be shown to you, whereas
politicans have to always be certain.
The problem is that most things aren't very certain, and that's not a way to inspire voters,
to say, 'maybe'.
