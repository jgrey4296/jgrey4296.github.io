"Sankara: Yes. You cannot carry out fundamental change without a certain amount of madness.
In this case, it comes from noncomformity, the courage to turn your back on the old formulas,
the courage to invent the future. Besides, it took the madmen of yesterday for us to be able to act with
extreme clarity today. I want to be one of those madmen.
Rapp: To Invent the future?
Sankara: Yes. We must dare to invent the future."
