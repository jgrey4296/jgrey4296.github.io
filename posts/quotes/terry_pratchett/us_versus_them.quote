It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think
that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was
us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be. I've certainly
never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one
of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them that do the bad things.
