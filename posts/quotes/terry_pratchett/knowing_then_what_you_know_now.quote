“That was always the dream, wasn't it? 'I wish I'd known then what I know now'?
But when you got older you found out that you NOW wasn't YOU then. You then was
a twerp. You then was what you had to be to start out on the rocky road of
becoming you now, and one of the rocky patches on that road was being a twerp.”
