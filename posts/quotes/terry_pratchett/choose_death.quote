“There is always a choice."
"You mean I could choose certain death?"
"A choice nevertheless, or perhaps an alternative. You see I believe in freedom.
Not many people do, although they will of course protest otherwise. And no
practical definition of freedom would be complete without the freedom to take
the consequences. Indeed, it is the freedom upon which all the others are
based.”
