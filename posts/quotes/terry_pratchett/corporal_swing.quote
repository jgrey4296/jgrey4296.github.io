“Swing, though, started in the wrong place. He didn't look around, and watch and
learn, and then say, 'This is how people are, how do we deal with it?' No, he
sat and thought: This is how the people ought to be, how do we change them?' And
that was a good enough thought for a priest but not for a copper, because
Swing's patient, pedantic way of operating had turned policing on its head.”
