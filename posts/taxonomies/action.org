** Schechners performance theory                 :clock:ritual:time:

   :Qualtities_of_Ritual:
   P8: "Play, Games, Sports, Theater, and Ritual.
   Several basic qualities are shared by these activities:
   1) A Special ordering of Time;
   2) A Special value attached to objects
   3) Non-productivity in terms of goods
   4) Rules
   Often special places - non-ordinary places - are set aside or constructed
   to perform these activities in."
   :END:

   | Time          |                                                                |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Clock Time    | Mono-directional, linear yet cyclical uniform measurement      |
   |               | of the day                                                     |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Event Time    | Activity has a set sequence and all sets must be completed     |
   |               | regardless of the clock time.                                  |
   |               | Eg: Baseball, rain dances, scripted theatrical performances.   |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Set Time      | Arbitrary time pattern is imposed on events. They begin        |
   |               | and end at certain moments regardless of completion.           |
   |               | Eg: Football, games based on "how many".                       |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Symbolic Time | Where the span of the activity represents a difference span of |
   |               | clock time.                                                    |
   |               | Eg: Theater, ritual, play.                                     |

   p8-9 uses Boxing as an example of layer forms of time.
