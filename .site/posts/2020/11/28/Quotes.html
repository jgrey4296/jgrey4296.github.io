<h3 id="stand-on-zanzibar">Stand On Zanzibar</h3>
<p>One strong inspiration for me is John Brunner’s Stand On Zanzibar. 
In it, he use’s what McLuhan describes as ‘The Innis Mode’ after Harold
Innis. A… swirling multi perspective approach to describing an entire
society, fluidly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is nothing wilful or arbitrary about the Innis mode of expression. Were it to be translated into perspective prose, it would not only require huge space, but the insight into the modes of interplay among forms of organisation would also be lost. Innis sacrificed point of view and prestige to his sense of the urgent need for insight.</p>

  <p>A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding. As Innis got more insight he abandoned any mere point of view in his presentation of knowlege. When he interrelates the development of the steam press with ‘the consolidation of the vernaculars’ and the rise of nationalism and revolution he is not reporting anybody’s point of view, least of all his own. He is setting up a mosaic configuration or galaxy for insight . . .</p>

  <p>Innis makes no effort to ‘spell out’ the interrelations between the components in his galaxy. He offers no consumer packages in his later work, but only do-it-yourself kits…”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marshall McLuhan: The Gutenberg Galaxy</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>He does this using chapters categorized into ‘Context’, ‘Continuity’, ‘Tracking With Closeups’, and ‘The Happening World’.
Where each provide a view of society from various distances. From adverts to the works of fictional Sociologist <a href="#chadmulligan">Chad C. Mulligan</a>, to main characters, to random people.</p>

<p>(HISTORY Papa Hegel he say that all we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. I know people who can’t even learn from what happened this morning. Hegel must have been taking the long view.<br />
