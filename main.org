** Network Layers, metaphors, and the DCEL

   The dcel is a clear means of representing a 3-layer ladder of abstraction. Vertex <-> HalfEdge <-> Face
   With Voronoi, and tensor based city gen as generators. 
   
   Society is a DCEL of many layers of abstraction.
   CiF showed how to flatten the layers for interactions somewhat.
   Versu showed a different layer structure, of greater range of interactions. 

   I'm trying to get to an understanding of layer descriptions in a similar way to deep learning descriptions.
   To describe particular structures, recombine and open particular transforms of outside data into internal data.
   
   
   inputs --> (--> InputTransform --> (Selection, SelectAll, Gate, Parameterize, Compile, Delay, Store, Retrieve) -> OutputTransform) -> Actions

   This is very like reaktor. Passing signals that carry information in various ways between instruments, voices, that can include standards like MIDI.

** Westworld anthony hopkins quote
   "They come back because they discover something they imagine no
   one had ever noticed before. Something they fall in love
   with. They’re not looking for a story that tells them who they
   are. They already know who they are. They’re here because they want
   a glimpse of who they could be.”

   Rather, make games where: 

   "They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are. They
   already know who they are. They're here because they want a glimpse
   of how the world could be."
   
   Shift the focus from the individual, to the society around them.
   Let people play to understand more about the world in which they live.
** Against Machine Learning for my work
   Machine learned models contain the biases of the training dataset.
   Authored content provides individual perspectives, and reactions
   against biases. 
** nlp thoughts
   Nyt presidential mentions. Amount, detection of inauguration, candidacy, promotion? First mention. Last mention, obit. Movements? 
   Expand to other politicians? And chart them. Has trump had a different news cycle pattern from other presidents? To what degree?
   Sentiment? Style of language used, length of article...
   Papers that report absolute failure? 
   Videogame politics shift since the election?
   Versu simulates people, giving them a language of desires. If social structures are also modelled with a language of desires and rituals, let the individuals modify the institutions. Instutions will model the individuals who determine the modifications

*** TODO Unit Testing of writing?
    If i annotate sections with meta-data, I could write a unit testing framework for documents
    that looks for particular regexs, tags, sequences, headings etc.

    Such as (using chai like notation):
    document.should.have.a.section('background')
    document.should.mention('fligstein')
    document.section('background').should.mention('bourdieu')
    document.should.have.a.greaterthan.length('10 pages');

*** TODO Layered Architecture
    <2017-03-29 Wed>
    CiF has layers but not constitutive rules
    Versu has constitutive rules, fsms, but only one layer

    There are different combinations of:
    constitutive rules,
    aggregations
    scaling,
    selection

    That can be applied in different layers. What would the architecture be for that?
*** TODO Heuristic Ranking
    Heuristically compared red/black tree,

    RB Tree helps minimise the number of comparisons the user has to perform.
   
    should be able to adjust values by shifting them in relation to neighbours,
    in ways similar to the Voronoi Beach Line.

    all with inputs, and outputs

    Rules: conditions can test on any other morphism?
    how would that be encoded in EL?
    .x.y.[instance].$id.name.$x?

    instance semantics?
    to select a particular concept: .person
    to select an instance of a concept: .person(instance)?
    instance of an instance? 

    modal morphism operators?
    types of rule: instance -> existence -> ground?
