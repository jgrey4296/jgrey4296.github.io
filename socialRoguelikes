Games still prefer violence and combat to social interactions. Anne Sullivan highlights it, but what does it really mean to have social gameplay instead of combat focused gameply?
We can look at game dseign, and the systems that facilitate player to player social systems in games like Eve Online, and what Raph Loster has written about the variety of social gameplay mechanics that multiplayer games can use. His focus has typically been multiplayer games, but such mechanics should be able to be used for AI 
opponents as well. 
We can also look at how Cif and Versu enable social narratives to be encoded and reasoned about in computational systems. 
Going further, we can look at narratives and real world structures that describe the social gameplay that interests us. Organizations, Institutions, and politics. Red Mars and Discworld. The real, and fictional, worlds that exist in other media have no real equivalent as yet, but have suh potential. 
One important example is A Series of unfortunate events. A sequence of books that are all very simiar, but which the social system that surrounds the main characters changes dramatically each time.
