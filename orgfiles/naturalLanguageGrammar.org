* Natural Language Grammar

With a language corpus, learn n-grams, and map those n-grams
to a trie. Let the use navigate the trie, pruning, tagging variables,
annotating phrases, as they progress and search down the trie.
Possibly focus on sentence level construction.

Use the NYTimes and Guardian APIs for data.
