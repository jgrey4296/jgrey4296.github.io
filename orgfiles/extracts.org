**** P22: Arthur and the Bulldozer
     
     "Human Beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the
     environs of Arhut's house had settled into a steady routine. It
     was Arthu's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making
     occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book;
     it was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthu with the
     occasional new ply such as the For the Public Good talk, or the
     March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You
     Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and
     threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit
     around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations
     to see how they could turn the situtation to their financial
     advantage."

     Also of Note: Ford's habits of crashing parties and making fun of Astrophysicists.
