   Different people for roles:
   | Role A     | Role B      |
   |------------+-------------|
   | Father     | Son         |

   | Employer   | Employees   |
   |            |             |

   One person multiple roles:
   | Student      | Child   |

*** Institutional Structure                   :structure:theory:institutions:

*** Institutions As AI
    Assume that we cannot create something smarter than ourselves If
    Institutions are AI, they are not Human-AI Complete If So, they
    are potentially, (and in practice actually exist) in real world
    computers already supplemented by our own intelligence.  They
    should be able to be modelled in a human authorable system then.

    Person of Interest is an example of this, AI's existing but
    interacting and manipulating the world through human actors.

*** Potential Systems                                               :systems:

**** Existing
     Versu / Exclusion Logic
     Prom Week / CiF
     Immerse / ABL
     Sugarscape
     MOISE

     Democracy
     Don't Starve
     Spacebase DF-9
     URR
     Sims / Sims Medieval
     Sim City

**** To Model

***** Abortion
      Legality -> Means -> Consequences -> Judgements

*** Behaviour Monad                                 :formal:math:monad:types:

    Purpose: To allow descriptions of institutional data to be processed
    by institutional forces to determine actions for agents at any given time.

    Monads have specific rules enable sequencing of computation in an abstracted
    form. Being able to describe data, and operations on that data, but wrap it in
    a monad to enable other operations... would seem useful.

*** Rete/ Rules                                     :architecture:rules:rete:

    Rete separates into Alpha, beta networks, and actions.
    Alpha and beta networks combine to create clauses

    There are a similarity with CiF, Versu, and Neural Networks, and Democracy 3

**** CiF
     Volition Rules -> Volitions -> Selection -> Influence Rules -> Actions -> Trigger Rules
**** Versu
     Facts -> State Assessments...

**** Neural Nets /Democracy
     Every node of a layer connected to every node of the next layer,
     Layer -> Layer -> Layer...
