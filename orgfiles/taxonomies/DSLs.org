declarative goals: !achievement and ?test

triggering events can be + or - beliefs, achievement or test goals

**** CALM: Consistency as Logical Monotonicity
**** "Gray's Twelfth Challenge"
DWIM : Do What I Mean
Spec Language that:
   1) Is Easy to express designs
   2) Is Compilable
   3) Can describe all applications

      System should 'reason' about application:
      Ask about exception cases
      Ask about incomplete specification
      Not be onerous

**** Borges "A New Refutation of Time"
"The Denial of time involves two negations: The negation of the succession
of the terms of a series, negation of the synchronism of the terms in two
different series"

**** Disorderly programming and datastructures

Linear Logic: conjoin predicates with *,
replace with -o
! indicates permanent state

predicates can be resources. ie: multiple of the same predicate has meaning.
(think resources in cultist simulator)

uniform non-determinism.

has stages of rule groups.

Requirements for First Class Time (see Lee):
   1) ability to express timing constraints
   2) timed communication
   3) enforcement of timing constraints
   4) tolerance of violations and constraints
