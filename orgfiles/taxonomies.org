   Hofstader on intuition pumps: "consider the intuition pump to be a tool with
   many settings, and 'turn all the knobs' to see if the same intuitions still
   get pumped when you consider variations".

   Quine: "Semantic ascent"

   J.Z Young objecting fanciful language in scientific writing: "English was
   becoming the international language of science, and it behooves us native
   English-speakers to write works that can be read by "a patient Chinese with a
   good dictionary".

   Feynman in "Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman": "If you've made up your mind
   to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always decide
   to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only publish results of a
   certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must publish both kinds
   of results."
