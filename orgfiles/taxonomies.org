   Hofstader on intuition pumps: "consider the intuition pump to be a tool with
   many settings, and 'turn all the knobs' to see if the same intuitions still
   get pumped when you consider variations".

   Quine: "Semantic ascent"

   J.Z Young objecting fanciful language in scientific writing: "English was
   becoming the international language of science, and it behooves us native
   English-speakers to write works that can be read by "a patient Chinese with a
   good dictionary".

   Feynman in "Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman": "If you've made up your mind
   to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always decide
   to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only publish results of a
   certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must publish both kinds
   of results."

   P8: "Play, Games, Sports, Theater, and Ritual.
   Several basic qualities are shared by these activities:
   1) A Special ordering of Time;
   2) A Special value attached to objects
   3) Non-productivity in terms of goods
   4) Rules
   Often special places - non-ordinary places - are set aside or constructed
   to perform these activities in."

   | Event Time    | Activity has a set sequence and all sets must be completed     |
   |               | regardless of the clock time.                                  |
   |               | Eg: Baseball, rain dances, scripted theatrical performances.   |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Set Time      | Arbitrary time pattern is imposed on events. They begin        |
   |               | and end at certain moments regardless of completion.           |
   |               | Eg: Football, games based on "how many".                       |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Symbolic Time | Where the span of the activity represents a difference span of |
   |               | clock time.                                                    |
   |               | Eg: Theater, ritual, play.                                     |

   are incorporated into authentic ceremonies, they are always part of a
