* Westworld anthony hopkins quote
  "They come back because they discover something they imagine no
  one had ever noticed before. Something they fall in love
  with. They’re not looking for a story that tells them who they
  are. They already know who they are. They’re here because they want
  a glimpse of who they could be.”

  Rather, make games where: 

  "They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are. They
  already know who they are. They're here because they want a glimpse
  of how the world could be."
   
  Shift the focus from the individual, to the society around them.
  Let people play to understand more about the world in which they live.
