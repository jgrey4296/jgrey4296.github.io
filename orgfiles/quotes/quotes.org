* Abraham Lincoln
But another class of reasoners hold the opinion that there is no such relation
between capital and labor, as assumed; and that there is no such thing as a
freeman being fatally fixed for life, in the condition of a hired laborer, that
both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them groundless. They
hold that labor is prior to, and independent of, capital; that, in fact, capital
is the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first
existed -- that labor can exist without capital, but that capital could never
have existed without labor. Hence they hold that labor is the superior --
greatly the superior -- of capital.

The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a
surplus with which to buy tools or land, for himself; then labors on his own
account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.
This, say its advocates, is free labor -- the just and generous, and prosperous
system, which opens the way for all -- gives hope to all, and energy, and
progress, and improvement of condition to all. If any continue through life in
the condition of the hired laborer, it is not the fault of the system, but
because of either a dependent nature which prefers it, or improvidence, folly,
or singular misfortune. I have said this much about the elements of labor
generally, as introductory to the consideration of a new phase which that
element is in process of assuming. The old general rule was that educated people
did not perform manual labor. They managed to eat their bread, leaving the toil
of producing it to the uneducated. This was not an insupportable evil to the
working bees, so long as the class of drones remained very small. But now,
especially in these free States, nearly all are educated -- quite too nearly
all, to leave the labor of the uneducated, in any wise adequate to the support
of the whole. It follows from this that henceforth educated people must labor.
Otherwise, education itself would become a positive and intolerable evil. No
country can sustain, in idleness, more than a small per centage of its numbers.
The great majority must labor at something productive. From these premises the
problem springs, "How can labor and education be the most satisfactory
combined?"

OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and

can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other
systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them.

"Natural: How Faith in Nature's Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science":

And then there's the problem of my own privilege. I have never walked for miles to secure drinking water, or medicine, or books.
Machines wash my clothing and my dishes. Natural light is a wonderful thing, but for nearly a billion people with no access to power,
and billions more with only intermittent access, the prospect of unnatural light is no less wonderful.
No one has told me that my sexual orientation is unnatural, or my biology is naturally inferior.
Seen differently, praise of naturalness can look like praise of the privileges that render its downsides invisible.

The truth unquestionably is, that the only path to a subversion of the republican system of the Country is, by flattering the prejudices of the people, and exciting their jealousies and apprehensions, to throw affairs into confusion, and bring on civil commotion. Tired at length of anarchy, or want of government, they may take shelter in the arms of monarchy for repose and security.

Those then, who resist a confirmation of public order, are the true Artificers of monarchy—not that this is the intention of the generality47 of them. Yet it would not be difficult to lay the finger upon some of their party who may justly be suspected. When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits—despotic in his ordinary demeanour—known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty—when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day—It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.”

Our new government is founded... upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man;

It's funny how nooooobody talks about "Irish Slaves" until Black people start protesting for their
freedom. Then fragile people of whiteness resume their social media campaign of conflating
indentured servitude with slavery.

People will try to shout down Black folks' oppression by claiming that there were white folks who were
also oppressed, as if that somehow justifies oppression of any sort. I need y'all to get a
better narrative.

If you want to have a discussion about the injustices perpetuated against Irish immigrants, have at it.
But don't use it as a way to diminish the oppression of Black people that has spanned over 400 years
and covers five centuries of history.

* Alvin Gouldner
It follows that neither involvement suffices to sustain theorists’ efforts to develop understanding of the social totality, although ironically both Party theorists and University academicians agree that each of their (different) group environments already suffices for that very purpose. My own conclusion is to the contrary. I therefore believe that one of the central tasks of social theory in our time is to attempt to rethink the position of theory's own group involvements and to re-examine the conditions, social and organizational, requisite for the development of an effective community of theorists committed to the understanding of the social totality.

“The call to prison abolition is a call to think more broadly
than a single institution or practice, but to recognize that
the prison is a target for abolition (like chattel slavery
before it) because it sits at the intersection between an
entire series of institutions and practices that are
predicated on the massive elimination of populations, of
the marginalization of persons, and of the exposure to
premature death of the many for the sake of the few.”

https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt
In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months. Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week. They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.
Bill Atkinson, the author of Quickdraw and the main user interface designer, who was by far the most important Lisa implementor, thought that lines of code was a silly measure of software productivity. He thought his goal was to write as small and fast a program as possible, and that the lines of code metric only encouraged writing sloppy, bloated, broken code.
He recently was working on optimizing Quickdraw's region calculation machinery, and had completely rewritten the region engine using a simpler, more general algorithm which, after some tweaking, made region operations almost six times faster. As a by-product, the rewrite also saved around 2,000 lines of code.
He was just putting the finishing touches on the optimization when it was time to fill out the management form for the first time. When he got to the lines of code part, he thought about it for a second, and then wrote in the number: -2000.
I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.

"How can antisemitism seem so invisible?"

Partly it’s that it allows Jews success. Many oppressions rely on keeping a targeted group of people poor, uneducated, designated non-white, or otherwise 'at the
the “middleman” - Rulers used Jews for “mid- dlemen” jobs that put Jews in direct contact with the
the Court Jew - History is full of unpopular kings who managed to save
bottom.’ Anti-Jewish oppression doesn’t depend on that. Although at many times
it has kept Jews in poverty or designated non-white, these have been “optional”
features. Because the point of anti-Jewish oppression is to keep a Jewish face
in front, so that Jews, instead of ruling classes, become the target for
peoples’ rage, it works even more smoothly when Jews are allowed some success,
and can be perceived as the ones “in charge” by other oppressed groups.

It's absolutely possible to critique Israel without being antisemitic - but it's not automatic.
you keep things clear when you describe accurately and speicifcally what you oppose,
and critique actions and policy as unjust - not people or nations as evil.

* Bertolt Brecht
Nowadays, anyone who wishes to combat lies and ignorance and to write the truth must overcome at least five difficulties. He must have the courage to write the truth when truth is everywhere opposed; the keenness to recognize it, although it is everywhere concealed; the skill to manipulate it as a weapon; the judgment to select those in whose hands it will be effective; and the cunning to spread the truth among such persons. These are formidable problems for writers living under Fascism, but they exist also for those writers who have fled or been exiled; they exist even for writers working in countries where civil liberty prevails.

Beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma survivors there exists an
undamaged essence, a self that is confident, curious, and calm, a self that has
been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival.
Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the self will spontaneously emerge,
and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process.

 'To exist is to differ; difference, in one sense, is the substantial side of
 things, what they have most in common and what makes them most different. One
 has to start from this difference and to abstain from trying to explain it,
 especially by starting with identity, as so many persons wrongly do. Because
 identity is a minimum and, hence, a type of difference, and a very rare type at
 that, in the same way as rest is a type of movement and the circle a type of
 ellipse. To begin with some primordial identity implies at the origin a
 prodigiously unlikely singularity, or else the obscure mystery of one simple
 being then dividing for no special reason.' (idem p. 73).

"We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.
We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology.
This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this
combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces."

One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long
enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer
interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply
too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you
give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.

One day, on tearing off some old bark, I saw two rare beetles and seized one in each hand;

forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as well as the third one.

- *Interesting things happen over time.*

Sadly, computers and computer languages suck at dealing with things that happen
over time. No, I don't think you should go make a new language to "solve" this

problem yet, so you'd just be wasting your time until we figure that out.

When people say,
“we have made it

— Clint Smith

all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestones
of those who did not make it, those who did not
survive to see the confetti fall from the sky, those who

did not live to watch the parade roll down the street.
I have grown accustomed to a lifetime of aphorisms
meant to assuage my fears, pithy sayings meant to

convey that everything ends up fine in the end. There is no
solace in rearranging language to make a different word
tell the same lie. Sometimes the moral arc of the universe

does not bend in a direction that will comfort us.
Sometimes it bends in ways we don’t expect & there are
people who fall off in the process. Please, dear reader,

do not say I am hopeless, I believe there is a better future
to fight for, I simply accept the possibility that I may not
live to see it. | have grown weary of telling myself lies

that I might one day begin to believe. We are not all left
standing after the war has ended. Some of us have
become ghosts by the time the dust has settled.

"It is an honor to stand before you, for you represent the freedom and the
future of our galaxy. The once-great Republic and Jedi Order have become victims
of their own ambitions, and the Supreme Chancellor is no more than a pawn of
corporate monopolies. As a people you called out for change, you called out for
leadership, and I humbly answered that call. Together we challenged the system.
We asked for equality. And how were we met? With war! The Jedi secret army of
clones was revealed, and their treachery was far greater than we could have
imagined! Countless living beings—these clones the Jedi created—have been sent
to their deaths, while we sacrifice mainly droids. Our soldiers of flesh and
blood are willing participants! They are your fathers and sons, mothers and
daughters, who fight not because they were grown and designed to do so, but
because they know in their hearts that they are fighting for a just and noble
cause!"

The jedi order's problem is Yoda. No being can wield that kind of power for centuries without
becoming complacent at best or corrupt at worst. He has no idea that it's overtaken him;
he no longer sees all the little cumulative evils that the Republic tolerates and fosters,
from slavery to endless wars, and he never asks, "Why are we not acting to stop this?"
Live alongside corruption for too long, and you no longer notice the stench.
The Jedi cannot help the slaves of Tatooine, but they can help the slavemasters.

I responded to your first letter out of
courtesy. I ignored the second as a hint that I did
not intend to become your permanent pen pal. The
arrival of still a third obliges me to be a little more
explicit.

I have always been interested in the morbid
aberrations which drive persons like yourself so
pompously to seek correspondence with strangers.
In this respect your letters have been illuminating.
But they also reveal you as a witless and
meddlesome old ass, self-deluded and full of
vapours.

I must, therefore, urge you in the future to
address yourself to your own affairs rather than to
mine. As an incentive toward this healthy goal, I
promise that your future correspondence will be
returned to you unopened.

“The act of making music, clothes, art, or even food has a very different, and
possibly more beneficial effect on us than simply consuming those things. And
yet for a very long time, the attitude of the state toward teaching and funding
the arts has been in direct opposition to fostering creativity among the general
population. It can often seem that those in power don’t want us to enjoy making
things for ourselves—they’d prefer to establish a cultural hierarchy that
devalues our amateur efforts and encourages consumption rather than creation.
This might sound like I believe there is some vast conspiracy at work, which I
don’t, but the situation we find ourselves in is effectively the same as if
there were one. The way we are taught about music, and the way it’s socially and
economically positioned, affect whether it’s integrated (or not) into our lives,
and even what kind of music might come into existence in the future. Capitalism
tends toward the creation of passive consumers, and in many ways this tendency
is counterproductive.”

PREFACE
Ian Bogost (2007) Famously Changed The Direction Of Video Game studies by focusing attention not on narratives or the logics of play but on the mode of argumentation that is contained, produced, and advanced within the operational procedures of the game.
Instead of pursuing research by following the established routes, Bogost introduced and demonstrated the opportunities and challenges of investigating games as a form of rhetoric- "procedural rhetoric❞ — by which "arguments are made not through the construction of words and images, but through the authorship of rules of behavior, the construction of dynamic models" (2007, 29).
This book introduces and develops another shift in perspective.
Its concern, however, is not the argument in the game but the game in the argument.
An argument - whether in academic research, law and regulation, marketing and advertising campaigns, or on the streets and in popular discussions - is nothing other than the attempt for one party to gain a discursive advantage over an opponent.
Crafting a persuasive argument, following the twists and turns of another's logic, and developing an insightful critique of the different positions that are already available are all aspects of an elaborate game.
And the fact is that some individuals play it better than others.
In the ancient world, it is Socrates who is considered to be the reigning champion.
In the modern period, however, the prize could easily go to Immanuel Kant.
Kant, in fact, did not just play the game; he gamed the entire system.
He knew the deck was already stacked against him, and that if he played by the established rules, there would be no chance of winning or progressing to the next level.
So rather than continue to play by the existing protocols and procedures, he simply altered the rules of the game.
For those who do not know the story, here is the short version: In the Critique of Pure Reason (episode one in Kant's critically acclaimed trilogy), Kant notes how efforts in philosophy had run aground.
For close to two thousand years, he argues, philosophers have been asking questions that they never quite seemed to get any traction on answering.
So Kant, instead of trying to deal with and respond to the existing queries, games the system by changing the questions and the terms of the inquiry.

As he described it, "Hitherto it has been assumed that all our knowledge must conform to objects.
But all attempts to extend our knowledge of objects by establishing something in regards to them a priori, by means of concepts, have, on this assumption, ended in failure.
We must therefore make trial whether we may not have more success in the task of meta- physics, if we suppose that objects must conform to knowledge" (Kant 1965, B xvi).

Frustrated by failed attempts to determine whether and to what extent knowledge conforms to things in the world, Kant flips the script and plays an entirely different game, one based on different kinds of questions and involving a different set of rules.
Kant, therefore, was not content to continue playing by the existing procedures and protocols but questioned the very operational limits of the game itself in order to shift perspective and formulate new and previously unheard of possibilities.
This is precisely the task and objective of Gaming the System.
Following Kant's example, what I am interested in identifying and critically examining are those philosophical problems regarding video games, game studies, and virtual worlds that seem, for one reason or another, to be intractable, irresolvable, or inconclusive.
This is done not in an effort to offer some novel or innovative solutions to the existing problems but to challenge the terms and conditions of the standard modes of inquiry in order to change what is asked about and why.
And this effort falls squarely within the proper purview and domain of what is called "philosophy".
As Daniel Dennett (1996, vii) once explained (and in the first lines of the preface to one of his books): "I am a philosopher, not a scientist, and we philosophers are better at questions than answers.
I haven't begun by insulting myself and my discipline, in spite of first appearances.
Finding better questions to ask, and breaking old habits and traditions of asking, is a very difficult part of the grand human project of understanding ourselves and our world."

I think everyone whose response to the financial struggles of an artist is
"well, you should have gone into tech or something useful"
should have to go 30 days with no reading, no TV, no movies, no museum visits, no video games,
no theatre, and have arts stripped from all their other experiences...
no music in restaurants, at sporting events, bars, stores, nothing.
No audio books or podcasts or music on their commute.
After 30 days deprived of all contributions of artists, I would be interested
to know if anyone would still say artists were drains on society and unworthy of life.

Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this:

'You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do. What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself — educating your own judgements. Those that stay must remember, always, and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this particular society.

"In recent years a good deal of the very best sociological work has been devoted
to the study of organization.

Although the term, organization, belongs to the category of expressions about which there is maintained an air of informed
vagueness, certain special conventions exist that focus its use, with
qualifications, on a delimited set of phenomena.

In accordance with these conventions, the term applies correctly to stable associations of persons
engaged in concerted activities directed to the attainment of specific
objectives.

It is thought to be a decisive characteristic of such organizations
that they are deliberately instituted relative to these objectives. Because
organizations, in this sense, are implementing and implemented programs of
action that involve a substantial dose of comprehensive and rational planning,
they are identified as instances of formal or rational organization in order to
differentiate them from other forms."

The Places We Go When We Leave

There are worlds upon worlds all blooming with wonder
& numberless doorways between
& when we are done with mere skin & bone
we become travelers of shadow & dreams we do not need form, nor breath, eyes or claws
to hunt through the brilliance & gleam
& all pain fades away, all fear falls to gray
when we go where we go when we leave
but memory persists & love still exists
& we wait close & we watch as you grieve
for we know that you can't know the places we go
when our bodies fall finally to sleep
but don't hurt for us long, nor imagine us gone
though we've slipped into beauty unseen:
we're waiting right here for when you finally appear
& we can both go where we go when we leave.

Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others.”

* James Henry Hammond
In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. That is, a class requiring but a low order of intellect and but little skill. Its requisites are vigor, docility, fidelity. Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill. Fortunately for the South, she found a race adapted to that purpose to her hand. A race inferior to her own, but eminently qualified in temper, in vigor, in docility, in capacity to stand the climate, to answer all her purposes. We use them for our purpose, and call them slaves. We found them slaves by the common "consent of mankind," which, according to Cicero, "lex naturae est." The highest proof of what is Nature's law. We are old-fashioned at the South yet; slave is a word discarded now by "ears polite;" I will not characterize that class at the North by that term; but you have it; it is there; it is everywhere; it is eternal.

The Senator from New York said yesterday that the whole world had abolished slavery. Aye, the name, but not the thing; all the powers of the earth cannot abolish that. God only can do it when he repeals the fiat, "the poor ye always have with you;" for the man who lives by daily labor, and scarcely lives at that, and who has to put out his labor in the market, and take the best he can get for it; in short, your whole hireling class of manual laborers and "operatives," as you call them, are essentially slaves. The difference between us is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment among our people, and not too much employment either. Yours are hired by the day, not cared for, and scantily compensated, which may be proved in the most painful manner, at any hour in any street in any of your large towns. Why, you meet more beggars in one day, in any single street of the city of New York, than you would meet in a lifetime in the whole South. We do not think that whites should be slaves either by law or necessity. Our slaves are black, of another and inferior race. The status in which we have placed them is an elevation. They are elevated from the condition in which God first created them, by being made our slaves. None of that race on the whole face of the globe can be compared with the slaves of the South. They are happy, content, unaspiring, and utterly incapable, from intellectual weakness, ever to give us any trouble by their aspirations. Yours are white, of your own race; you are brothers of one blood. They are your equals in natural endowment of intellect, and they feel galled by their degradation. Our slaves do not vote. We give them no political power. Yours do vote, and, being the majority, they are the depositories of all your political power.

Your society would be reconstructed, your government overthrown, your property divided, not as they have mistakenly attempted to initiate such proceedings by meeting in parks, with arms in their hands, but by the quiet process of the ballot-box.

Protesters don't block traffic to gain your support. They do it so you can see what it feels
like to be stuck in a powerless situation.
How do you respond to this situation?
Are you calm and peaceful?
Do you want to spend years organizing political talks about it?
Nope, you want to run those protesters over, kill them, kill them all.
If you want to kill protesters who have you stuck in traffic, imagine what you would want to do
to a system that patrols, harasses and kills you.
The sooner you learn perspective the sooner you won't have to be stuck in traffic.

Make your revolution in real time -- not in the street, but in the recording studio.

own viscera as if you were inside them.

can be filmed without knowing it. You can be called to act it all out again

exceptional version for the "happy few". Any of your acts can be instantly
broadcast on any station.

Around 1650, Johann Gerdes accidentally discovered a method of surface preparation
that permitted easy drawing of steel wire.
It was a process called "sull-coating" whereby iron was steeped in urine until
a soft coating developed.
This procedure remained in practice for the next 150 years;
later, diluted sour beer was found to work as effectively.
By about 1850 it was discovered that water worked just as well.

What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label, "Liberal"? If by "Liberal" they mean, as they want people to believe, someone who is soft in his policies abroad, who is against local government, and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer's dollar, then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of "Liberal." But, if by a "Liberal," they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people - their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights, and their civil liberties - someone who believes that we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal," then I'm proud to say that I'm a "Liberal."

Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows.

While I have no problem with the use of artificial intelligence to compliment and improve human decision making,
suggesting that the AI itself *makes* the decision is a problem.
Legal and moral responsibility for a robot's actions should be no different than they are for any other AI System,
and these are the same as for any other tool.
Ordinarily, damage caused by a tool is the fault of an operator, and benefit from it is to the operator's credit.
If the system malfunctions due to poor manufacturing, then the fault may lay with the company that built it, and
the operator can sue to resolve this.

In contrast, creating a legal or even public-relations framework in which a robot can be blamed is like blaming the privates at Abu Grhaib for
being "bad apples". Yes, some apples are worse than others and perhaps culpably so, but ultimate responsibility lies within the command chain that
created the environment those privates operated in. Where the subject is machines we build and own, then the responsible role of the
organisation is even clearer.
We should never be talking about machines taking ethical decisions, but rather machines operated correctly within the limits we set for them.

You introduced intersectionality more than 30 years ago. How do you explain what it means today?

These days, I start with what it’s not, because there has been distortion. It’s not identity politics on steroids. It is not a mechanism to turn white men into the new pariahs. It’s basically a lens, a prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate together and exacerbate each other. We tend to talk about race inequality as separate from inequality based on gender, class, sexuality or immigrant status. What’s often missing is how some people are subject to all of these, and the experience is not just the sum of its parts.

And if short-sighted critics think that I only wanted to describe the things that I like,
what Oblonsky has for dinner or what Karenina’s shoulders are like, they are mistaken.
In everything, or nearly everything I have written, I have been guided by the need to
gather together ideas which for the purpose of self-expression were interconnected; but
every idea expressed separately in words loses its meaning and is terribly impoverished
when taken by itself out of the connection in which it occurs. The connection itself is
made up, I think, not by the idea, but by something else, and it is impossible to express
the basis of this connection directly in words. It can only be expressed indirectly—by
words describing characters, actions and situations.

"My decision to leave Spitzer after less than a year is fairly straightforward:
I was not able to build enough support to be able to deliver on either my
promise of change, or my vision of it. The reasons why are more complex. Part of
it has to do with COVID-19 and the rapid lockdown, which occurred after only
three months in post. It's hard enough to build social capital in a new place
without having to do it over Zoom. Part of it too has to do with the wider
inflexibility of U.S. academic structures. In an incredibly bureaucratic and
highly-regulated context, change is as much administrative as it is conceptual.
The lack of meaningful support—not lip service, of which there's always a
surfeit—meant my workload was absolutely crippling. No job is worth one's life
and at times I genuinely feared for my own. Race is never far from the surface
of any situation in the U.S. Having come directly from South Africa, I wasn't
prepared for the way it manifests in the U.S. and quite simply, I lacked the
tools to both process and deflect it. The lack of respect and empathy for Black

The project to uncover gender in science is not and should not be viewed as

neutral, but many are still led to believe that scientists simply decipher laws
from the great encrypted book of nature.  Nature, after all, is infinitely rich,
and there is much we do not know about it.  What we do know is influenced by our
history and our values. Science is a product of society.  the goal of uncovering
how gender influences the structure and polity of science extends the process of
critique that persuades us to affirm certain knowledge and practices over others
by rendering conscious the unconscious in our assumptions, priorities, and
methods.

Q: Hate the house rules: What are your thoughts on people who have “house rules” for commonly played board or card games? My in-laws have some for Gin Rummy that are terribly irritating, and people all seem to have their own rules for Monopoly. Am I allowed to insist on the real rules being played at my own house? I hate to be a stickler, but who just makes up rules for board games?

A: All rules for board games are made up. All games were, at some point, made up; there is no natural, immutable way to play Gin Rummy. The original rules of Monopoly only exist because someone in the early 1900s wanted to explain the tax theories of Henry George via a board game; there is no objective version of Monopoly. Moreover, the worst sort of argument one can have with relatives is one where the stakes are low but the sense of grievance is high. You will likely never convince your in-laws that their game rules are irritating, no matter how passionately you argue your case. Cheerfully embrace your in-laws’ ridiculous house rules (or politely decline to play and read a book instead), and feel free to make up your own rules at home, although if you find yourself at a point where every time you play a game you have to insist that everyone else follow “the real rules,” you might want to do something besides play board games with your guests. (There are no real rules. There are no real games, only endless variations on an arbitrary theme. Embrace chaos.)

Live a good life.
If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been,
but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.
If there are gods, but unjust, then tyou should not want to worship them.
If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

You are not compelled to form any opinion about this matter before you,
nor to disturb your peace of mind at all.
Things in themselves have no power to extort a verdict from you.

FICTION

I THINK of the innocent lives
Of people in novels who know they'll die
But not that the novel will end. How different they are
From us. Here, the moon stares dumbly down,
Through scattered clouds, onto the sleeping town,
And the wind rounds up the fallen leaves,
And somebody—namely me—deep in his chair,
Riffles the pages left, knowing there’s not
Much time for the man and woman in the rented room,
For the red light over the door, for the iris
Tossing its shadow against the wall; not much time
For the soldiers under the trees that line
The river, for the wounded being hauled away
To the cities of the interior where they will stay;
The war that raged for years will come to a close,
And so will everything else, except for a presence
Hard to define, a trace, like the scent of grass
After a night of rain or the remains of a voice
That lets us know without spelling it out
Not to despair; if the end is come, it too will pass.

* Nicholas Rescher
(rescher07:_dialec_)

Why this focus on the dialectic of inquiry? For one principal reason: because it exhibits epistemological processes at work in a setting of so- cially conditioned interactions. This communal perspective is surely a step in the right direction through countervailing against the baneful influence of the Cartesian egocentric orientation of modern epistemology. The tradi- tional and orthodox emphasis on the issue How can I convince myself?, How can I be certain? invites us to forget the social nature of the ground rules of probative reasoning—their rooting in the issue of: How can we go about convincing one another? The dialectics of disputation and contro- versy provides a useful antidote to cognitive egocentrism. It insists that we not forget the build-up of knowledge as an interactive communal enterprise subject to communal standards.

* Noam Chomsky
In my own professional work I have touched on a variety of different fields. I've done my work in mathematical linguistics, for example, without any professional credentials in mathematics; in this subject I am completely self-taught, and not very well taught. But I've often been invited by universities to speak on mathematical linguistics at mathematics seminars and colloquia. No one has ever asked me whether I have the appropriate credentials to speak on these subjects; the mathematicians couldn't care less. What they want to know is what I have to say. No one has ever objected to my right to speak, asking whether I have a doctor's degree in mathematics, or whether I have taken advanced courses in the subject. That would never have entered their minds. They want to know whether I am right or wrong, whether the subject is interesting or not, whether better approaches are possible - the discussion dealt with the subject, not with my right to discuss it.

But on the other hand, in discussion or debate concerning social issues or American foreign policy, Vietnam or the Middle East, for example, the issue is constantly raised, often with considerable venom. I've repeatedly been challenged on the grounds of credentials, or asked, what special training do you have that entitles you to speak of these matters. The assumption is that people like me, who are outsiders from a professional standpoint, are not entitled to speak on such things.

Compare mathematics and the political sciences -- it's quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is concern for content.

He never argued with people who said anything

believe that public argument changed such
people’s views, and he thought preaching back at
them simply brought boredom and bad blood.
But he asked probing questions of anybody who
said anything interesting, and “interest” was a
word to which he gave a wide range. Johnny
preferred people who laughed at the world rather
than whined at it. He shied away from those who
had adopted any ideology that blinded them to
either mathematical fact or real events.

Clearly, these new jobs would not replace the old ones, and nor should they.
Get rid of all the cleaners, rubbish collectors, bus drivers, supermarket
checkout staff and secretaries, for example, and society will very quickly grind
to a halt.
On the other hand, if we woke up one morning to find that all the highly paid
advertising executives, management consultants, and private equity directors had
disappeared, society would go on much as it did before: in a lot of cases,
probably quite a bit better.  So, to begin with, workers need to reclaim a sense
of pride and social worth.
Doing so would be a big step forward in making the case that the wages and
conditions of low-paid jobs must be improved in order to reflect the importance
they have in all of our lives.

The union is an expression of the prophetic profile of society. The union is born and reborn every time that, like the biblical prophets, it gives a voice to those who have none, denounces those who would “sell the needy for a pair of sandals” (cf. Amos 2: 6), unmasks the powerful who trample the rights of the most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the foreigner, the least, the discarded.

The capitalism of our time does not understand the value of the trade union, because it has forgotten the social nature of the economy, of the business. This is one of the greatest sins. Market economy: no. Let us say, social market economy, as St. John Paul II taught: social market economy. The economy has forgotten the social nature that it has as a vocation, the social nature of business, of life, of bonds and pacts. But perhaps our society does not understand the union also because it does not fight enough in terms of the “not yet rights”: of the existential peripheries, among those rejected from work.

“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

It is now highly feasible to take care of everybody on Earth at a ‘higher standard of living than any have ever known.’ It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary and henceforth unrationalizable as mandated by survival. Most importantly we have learned that from here on it is success for all or none, for it is experimentally proven by physics that “unity is plural and at minimum two” – the complementary but not mirror-imaged proton and neutron. You and I are inherently different and complimentary. Together we average as zero – that is, as eternity.

"We can now take care of everybody at a higher standard of living than anybody has ever known. It does not have to be “you or me,” so selfishness is unnecessary and war is obsolete. This has never been done before.“

Make it personal. Do as much damage as you can. Get your message across. That way, you stand a better chance of being taken seriously next time. Of being considered dangerous. And make no mistake about this: being taken seriously, being considered dangerous marks the difference - the only difference in their eyes - between players and little people.

My favorite activity is inventing.  An early arms control proposal
dealt with the problem of distancing that the President would
have in the circumstance of facing a decision about nuclear war.
There is a young man, probably a Navy officer, who accompanies
the President.    This young man has a black attache case which
contains the codes that are needed to fire nuclear weapons.
I could see the President at a staff meeting considering nuclear
was as an abstract question.  He might conclude: "On SIOP Plan
One, the decision is affirmative.  Communicate the Alpha line
XYZ."  Such jargon holds what is involved at a distance.

My suggestion was quite simple: Put that needed code number in
a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to
the heart of a volunteer.  The volunteer would carry with him
a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President.
If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only
way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands,
to kill one human being.  The President says, "George, I'm sorry
but tens of millions must die."  He has to look at someone and
realize what death is -- what an innocent death is.  Blood on
the White House carpet.  It's reality brought home.

What I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon, they said,
"My God, that's terrible.  Having to kill someone would distort
the President's judgment.  He might never push the button."

"The vast accumulations of knowledge - or at least of information - deposited by the ninteeth century have been responsible for an equally vast ignorance.
When there is so much to be known, when there are so many fields of knowledge in which the same words
are used with different meanings, when every one knows a little about a great many things,
it becomes increasibly difficult for anyone to know whether he knows what he is talking about or not.
And when we do not know, or when we do not know enough, we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts."

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/nonviolence-as-compliance/391640/

When nonviolence is preached as an attempt to evade the repercussions of
political brutality, it betrays itself. When nonviolence begins halfway through
the war with the aggressor calling time out, it exposes itself as a ruse. When
nonviolence is preached by the representatives of the state, while the state
doles out heaps of violence to its citizens, it reveals itself to be a con. And
none of this can mean that rioting or violence is "correct" or "wise," any more
than a forest fire can be "correct" or "wise." Wisdom isn't the point tonight.
Disrespect is. In this case, disrespect for the hollow law and failed order that
so regularly disrespects the community.

"There’s a lot of ways it can happen. It’s funny how I have popular bugs, right?
You shouldn’t have popular bugs. But the most popular bug with the latest
release, I added taverns to fortress mode, so the dwarves will go to a proper
establishment, get mugs, and make orders, and they’ll drink in the mug. And, you
know, things happen, mugs get spilled, there’s some alcohol on the ground.

Now, the cats would walk into the taverns, right, and because of the old blood
footprint code from, like, eight years ago or something, they would get alcohol
on their feet. It was originally so people could pad blood around, but now any
liquid, right, so they get alcohol on their feet. And then I wanted to add
cleaning stuff so when people were bathing, or I even made eyelids work for no
reason, because I do random things sometimes. So cats will lick and clean
themselves, and on a lark, when I made them clean themselves I’m like, ‘Well,
it’s a cat. When you do lick cleaning, you actually ingest the thing that you’re
cleaning off, right? They make hairballs, so they must swallow something,
right?' And so the cats, when they cleaned the alcohol off their feet, they all
got drunk. Because they were drinking.

But the numbers were off on that. I had never thought about, you know,
activating inebriation syndromes back when I was adding the cleaning stuff. I
was just like, ‘Well, they ingest it and they get a full dose,’ but a full dose
is a whole mug of alcohol for a cat-sized creature, and it does all the blood
alcohol size-based calculations, so the cats would get sick and vomit all over
the tavern.

The original bug report is, ‘There’s cat vomit all over my tavern, and there’s a
few dead cats,’ or whatever, and they’re like, ‘Why? This is broken.’

People helped me with this. We were all looking and figuring out, ‘What the heck
is going on here?’, and that was the chain of events. It’s like doing the
detective work to figure out that entire chain of events is what happened. You
can see how adding just a tavern that gave the opportunity for spilling alcohol,
which was really uncommon before, now all the spilled alcohol starts to, form in
one location where something could start to happen. You activate bugs and little
parts of code from eight, six years ago where you just didn’t balance the
numbers because it didn’t matter. You don’t want to spend time doing balancing
that doesn’t matter, because then you lose a couple of days doing something for
no reason."

* Theodor Adorno
It is ironic that philosophy so easily arouses the fury of common sense by being mistaken for the very abstractness it struggles against. It is certainly better—as in prephilosophical knowledge so in philosophy—not to proceed without a measure of autonomy of thought in relation to its subject matter. The logical apparatus owes its immeasurable improvement beyond primitive consciousness to this autonomy. It contains, intensified, at the level of content, the force of enlightenment that marks the historical development of philosophy. Yet as it became autonomous and developed into an apparatus, thinking also became the prey of reification and congealed into a high-handed method. Cybernetic machines are a crude example of this. They graphically demonstrate to people the nullity of formalized thinking abstracted from its contents insofar as such machines perform better than thinking subjects much of what used to be the proud achievement of the method of subjective reason. Should thinking subjects passively transform themselves into the instruments of such formalization, then they virtually cease being subjects. They approach the machine in the guise of its imperfect replica. Philosophical thinking begins as soon as it ceases to content itself with cognitions that are predictable and from which nothing more emerges than what had been placed there beforehand. The humane significance of computers would be to unburden the thinking of living beings to the extent that thought would gain the freedom to attain a knowledge that is not already implicit.

Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president.

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and
again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does
actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the
end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least
fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."

“The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and you spend twenty years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn’t shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Somebody says you have no art, so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms, so you dredge that up. None of this is necessary. There will always be one more thing.”

I expect that the House has heard of the little document, which is circulating, about the boat race between the NHS and a Japanese crew. Both sides tried hard to do well, but the Japanese won by a mile. The NHS was very discouraged and set up a consultancy. The consultancy came to the conclusion that the Japanese had eight people rowing and one steering, whereas the NHS had eight people steering and one rowing. The NHS appointed people to look at the problem and decided to reorganise the structure of the team so that there were three steering managers, three assistant steering managers and a director of steering services, and an incentive was offered to the rower to row harder. When the NHS lost a second race, it laid off the rower for poor performance and sold the boat. It gave the money it got from selling the boat to provide higher than average pay awards for the director of steering services.

"how an ethnic group comes to be recognized as such"

The basis for all these projects is ethnoracial mythmaking, which creates an ethnic group and racial lore to characterize the group. For such mythmaking to succeed, there needs to be a demographically significant subpopulation that is large and sociologically significant enough to require the group to be identified by a name, a creation story that explains how they got here, and a justification for their place in the society into which they are incorporated. This process of mythmaking has several steps that can be identified for the purposes of making it recognizable. Not all steps are required, nor is there a singular sequence to them.
First, societal recognition is available only to those groups that are socially significant enough to count. The history of the united states is in large part a history of the demography that recounts how the population of this nation became the admixture it is today. This population includes three categories:
1) persons present on the land well before the current nation was even a thought, for whom the land offered food to eat and a place to call home
2) persons who arrived voluntarily to labor and find their way in a new land; and
3) persons who arrived involuntarily.
