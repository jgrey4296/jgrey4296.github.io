Intelligence

An Introduction to Communication

and Artificial Intelligence
David J. Gunkel

Communication and artificial intelligence (Al) are closely
related. It is communication — particularly interpersonal
conversational interaction - that provides Al with its defining
test case and experimental evidence. Likewise, recent
developments in Al introduce new challenges and
opportunities for communication studies. Technologies such
as machine translation of human languages, spoken
dialogue systems like Siri, algorithms capable of producing
publishable journalistic content, and social robots are all
designed to communicate with users in a human-like way.

This timely and original textbook provides educators and
students with a much-needed resource, connecting the dots
between the science of Al and the discipline of
communication studies. Clearly outlining the topic’s scope,
content and future, the text introduces key issues and
debates, highlighting the importance and relevance of Al to
communication studies. In lively and accessible prose, David
Gunkel provides a new generation with the information,
knowledge, and skills necessary to working and living in a
world where social interaction is no longer restricted to
humans.

The first work of its kind, An Introduction to Communication
and Artificial Intelligence is the go-to textbook for students
and scholars getting to grips with this crucial
interdisciplinary topic.

mining games

In mining games,

the world starts out full of neat stuff!
Unsolved puzzles, hidden treasure,
interesting inhabitants, unresolved stories...

But then the player shows up and RUINS EVERYTHING.

=

before player arrives the is ce after player leaves
Mining games embody a fundamentally extractive approach to
gameplay. The player's presence in the game world makes the world
less alive, less interesting & generally worse over time as they drain
the world of its content. Then, once a game space is fully “mined
out”, there’s no reason to stick around, so they move on to the next.

Many mining games use procedural content generation (PCG) to
generate an infinite frontier, so that players always have somewhere
to go next. That way, they never have to confront the fact that they
ruin everything they touch!

Mining games are the ultimate entitlement simulators. The game
world exists entirely to serve the player's needs. PCG is used to fuel
the content furnace, to feed the player's all-consuming hunger for
content.

require concealment, because the rule structure that would
condemn his action as illegal is exactly the authority the spoil-
sport wishes to undermine.

When a set of Chess pieces are placed in their proper positions
on the board and a game begins, the pieces gain meaning. But
if, during a game, the action of a spoil-sport wipes the Chess
pieces from the board, meaning is violently erased. Removed
from their grid positions, the Chess pieces merely represent a
collection of scattered figurines. The spoil-sport returns the
game to its pre-game state as a collection of parts, no longer
the embodiment of the space of possibility set out by the rules

of the game.

The spoil-sport, more than any other kind of player, demon-
strates the fragility of the magic circle. Not bound by a faith in
the game, an interest in the lusory attitude, a respect for the
rules, or even a concern for the outcome, the spoil-sport is the
representative of the world outside the game. Armed with a

defined. Games usually require formal preparation: finding
players, reading the rules, opening a saved game file, shuffling
cards, setting up the board, and so on. Players must learn the
system and “officially” enter into the game and begin play. This
is a genuine hurdle for players of your game: they must attend
to the initial set of chores that lie on the border of the magic
circle; they must properly perform the rituals of entry.

Black Excellence on the World Stage

A showcase of excellence and humanity, The A ‘Negroes atthe 1900
Paris Exposition was a testament to the strength of the fist freed ‘generation of Black
‘Americans. Beyond strength, ths collection of photographs and statistics present a
narrative denied. A narrative of genius imovation, community, beouty, end-=most
‘important of all—humanity. A humanity that continues to be pushed out oF reach for most,
‘especially those who are closely tethered to these accounts,

WEB. Du Bois, Booker T: Washington, and Thomas Calloway came

together to gather these photos and information to showcase the

vibrant culture ofthe fist generation freed on the word stage in

The Exhibit of American Negroes. Utilizing stunning photography

‘and beautiful hand-drawn data portraits, Du Bois communicated

this excellence to @ European audience and received a gold medal

for his work.
This exhibition displays reproductions ofa select number of photographs and data
Portraits from Du Bois’ Pars exhibition, along with an in-gallery library to underline how
the display of humanity that took place at this exhibition echoes to this day. Color Line was
developed by a project team of Portland Art Museum staff across departments, including
‘Alex Haynes, John Goodwin, Grace Kook-Anderson, Ella Ray, and Ted Smith. We invite
Visitors to recognize how the problem of the color line existed in 1900, and persists
through the modern day.
Curated by Alex Haynes, and supported by John Goodwin, Grace Kook-Anderson, Ella Ray

‘and Ted Smith.

“As | began my journey of finding the humanity in framing my own familial histor, felt
dejected by the dead ends that seemed to prematurely end my research. But out ofthis,
‘grew an appreciation forthe value of the oral history and photographs passed down by
members of my family, And s0 | felt a personal connection withthe excellence Du Bois
‘once displayed on the world stage, With ths exhibition, | want to bring this narative to
the forefront and showcase how much that still means, more than 100 years later”

AMELIORATING MISOGYNy

The answer is that what matters is not dee {right there
onthe surface, in View of the proposed shift in focus from misogyny’
agents to its subjects. For while I do want to defend the importance
of reactions like resentment and disapproval to the nature of tmisog-
yny, I am also construing these attitudes less psychologistically than
iscommon, by placing the emphasis more on the “reactive” part and
less on the “attitude.” These are the responses women face in navigat-
ing their social environments, as subject to. whatever constraints may
‘merge from how they may reasonably be interpreted (as spelled out
Hore precisely directly above, in (3). Hostility that is expressed but

Having given this rough and partial sketch of a theory of the substan,

we can make some concrete (and, importantly, falsifiable) predic.

The basis for all these projects is ethnoracial mythmaking, which creates an
ethnic group and racial lore to characterize the group. For such mythmaking to
succeed, there needs to be a demographically significant subpopulation that is
large and sociologically significant enough to require the group to be identified
by a name, a creation story that explains how they got here, and a justification
for their place in the society into which they are’ Oo hig aoe of
mythmaking has several steps that can be identi :

‘The International Joint Commission oversees and protects the shared
waters of Canada and the United States. Created by the Boundary Waters
‘Treaty of 1909, it is one of the world’s oldest international environmental
bodies. A pioneering piece of transborder water governance, the IJC has

been integral to the modern Canada-United States relationship.

COMMISSION |

This is the definitive history of the International Joint Commission. Separating
‘myth from reality and uncovering the historical evolution of the IJC from its
{inception to its present, this collection features an impressive interdisciplinary
group of scholars and practitioners. Examining the many aspects of

border waters from east to west The First Century of the International Joint
‘Commission traces the three major periods of the JC, detailing its early focus
‘on water flow, its middle period of growth and increasing politicization, and
its modern emphasis on ecosystems.

Informative, detailed, and fascinating, The First Century of the International
Joint Commission is essential reading for academics, contemporary policy
makers, governments, and all those interested in sustainability, climate
change, pollution, and resiliency along the Canada-US Border.

dents of self-harm and 27,193 assaults. The violence is not
just between prisoners; thete were 7,437 assaults on prison
staff, a rise of 100 per cent in one year. Sexual assaults more
than doubled between 2011 and 2016.*5 In February 2017,
inspectors concluded that ‘there was not a single establish-
ment that we inspected in England and Wales in which it
was safe to hold children and young people’.** Prison deaths
are at record levels: 354 prisoners died in custody in 2016.
Of these, 119 were suicides.‘” And not surprising given what
is known about prison demographics.

Prisoners are largely drawn from the most damaged and
dysfunctional nooks of society. The majority have the liter-
acy skills of an eleven-year-old.** An estimated 20-30 per
cent have learning difficulties, although the vague figure is a
teflection of the damning failure of the prison system to
identify and support them.” Over half of women prisoners
and over a quarter of men report being abused as children.

hen the United States ratified the Bill of Rights in 1791,

it became the first country in the history of the world

to acknowledge the right to press freedom in its constitution.

The First Amendment came about because citizens,
distrustful of governmental power, demanded that basic
freedoms— among them a free press —be guaranteed. They

i understood from experience that a free press could be used
_ éffectively to challenge the government should it grow too
_ powerful or abusive. That often-adversarial relationship
between the press and government continues to this day. ™

geniuses—“my gifted children,” he called them, a phrase he coined.
He tracked the young people with high IQs in his study through
adolescence into adulthood and beyond, producing four separate vol-
umes during his lifetime. Upon being enrolled in the genius study, the
children, who were kept anonymous, provided a raft of information
about themselves and their upbringing—their health, family back-
ground, family income, home life. This was the data Terman used to
demonstrate how well his geniuses fared in life. Indeed, he found that
two-thirds of the “Term-ites” earned bachelor’s degrees, ten times the
national rate, as well as an unusually high number of doctorates and
medical and law degrees. The geniuses’ earning power was higher too:
while the median salary for white-collar jobs in 1954 was $5,800, the
equivalent in Terman’s group was $10,556.

The study's usefulness, it should be said, was quite limited. There
were the flaws with the test itself, and how it was applied: the geniuses
discovered by the test were a bit more likely to be male than female,
but that was less jarring than the near.total absence of blacks, Japa-
nese Americans, or American Indians. Also, incredibly, Terman’s team
individually tested two California boys who grew up to win Nobel
Prizes in physics and neither scored high enough to be included in the
study. One of those boys who was particularly stung by being passed
‘over was young Billy Shockley of Palo Alto, whose Nobel Pri
ognized his role in producing the first transistor; alongside Lew
man’s son, Frederick, Shockley would become a central figure in the
growth of Silicon Valley.

‘ond the test’s dubious accuracy, there was a flaw in how the study
cted over the years: Terman repeatedly intervened in
igh-1O subjects, often without. their knowledge. He

of contrast, “I don’t feel driven to change anything but my own situa-
tion.” Bina and Andreessen and their growing team of coders worked
out of the dark basement offices of the old Oil Chemistry building,
offices that soon filled up with piles of pizza boxes, stray cookie pack-
ages, empty soda cans, and Skittles wrappers.”° In a matter of months,
they had created a working version of the browser. Significantly, their
browser, which was given the name Mosaic, could embed images
directly on the page rather than clumsily requiring images to pop up
in a new browser window. On January 23, 1993, Andreessen posted a
file containing a first working version of Mosaic, under the words, “By
the power vested in me by no one in particular,-X-Mosaic is hereby,
released,”**
~ Andreessen expected there to be immediate demand for what was,
by all accounts, a vastly superior browser. “We just tried to hurry and
get it out there, initially to a limited group of 10 or 12 alpha and beta
testers,” he said. “Of course, the Internet is a great way to distribute
viruses, too; put a virus out and then it propagates.””? Born ona univer-
‘sity campus, Mosaic had additional advantages in quickly finding an
audience. To start, the campus itself was filled with young people with

computers and unusually fast Internet connections who were eager to
try som: new. When the public did in fact quickly engage with

Corruption froma
Regulatory Perspective

Maria De Benedetto

This book seeks to enrich and, in some
cases, reverse current ideas on corruption
and its prevention. It is a long held belief
that sanctions are the best guard against
corrupt practise. This innovative work
argues that in some cases sanctions
paradoxically increase corruption and that
controls provide opportunities for corrupt
transactions. Instead it suggests that better
regulation and responsive enforcement, not
sanctions, offer the most effective response
to corruption.

Darren Byler

Terror Capitalism

Uyghur Dispossession and Masculinity in a Chinese City
DARREN BYLER

In Terror Capitalism anthropologist Darren Byler theorizes the contemporary
Chinese colonization of the Uyghur Muslim minority group in the northwest
autonomous region of Xinjiang. He shows that the mass detention of over one
million Uyghurs in “reeducation camps” is part of processes of resource extraction
in Uyghur lands that have led to what he calls terror capitalism—a configuration
of ethnoracialization, surveillance, and mass detention that in this case promotes
settler colonialism. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the regional capital
Uriimchi, Byler shows how media infrastructures, the state’s enforcement of
“Chinese” cultural values, and the influx of Han Chinese settlers contribute to
Uyghur dispossession and their expulsion from the city. He particularly attends

to the experiences of young Uyghur men—who are the primary target of state
violence—and how they develop masculinities and homosocial friendships

to protect themselves against gendered, ethnoracial, and economic violence.

By tracing the political and economic stakes of Uyghur colonization, Byler
demonstrates that state-directed capitalist dispossession is co-constructed with a
colonial relation of domination.

“Darren Byler's Terror Capitalism provides critical insights into one of the most important
and contested topics in international human rights. Based on an extensive archive of first-
hand research, Byler gives a rich and detailed look at the persecution and cultural genocide
of the Uyghur. An indispensable resource for studies in human rights, surveillance, China,
Muslims, Islamophobia, capitalism, and more."—David Palumbo-Liu, Stanford University

THE NEW

NATIONAL
fy  HEALIG
SERVICE

Your new National Health Service begins on
5th July. What is it? How do you get it?

It will provide you with all medical; dental, and
nursing care. Everyone—rich or poor, man, woman
or child—can use it or any part of it. There are no
charges, except for a few special items. There are no
insurance qualifications. But it is not a “charity ”’,
You are all paying for it, mainly as taxpayers, and
‘it will relieve your money. worries in time of illness.”

DiSoRGaniZeD

There's a certain shame that comes from not
being the “organized” person | want (or others
expect me) to be. But | just can't get myself

to do the consistent small tasks required to
maintain an orderly life.

| can deep-clean my whole apartment in one
day, but if | can't develop the habit of putting
things away after | use them, it doesn't matter.
Clutter rises back up and takes over our house.
| can download a new productivity app and
spend hours setting it up, but if | don't develop
the habit of checking it daily, it doesn't matter.
Obligations and to-do items pile up, and!
struggle to remember all the tasks on my plate.
It's upsetting to try so hard to change my chaotic
ways and fight my natural impulses, only to slip
back into my old habits every time.

Attempting to force behavioral change never
seems to work for any substantial period of time.

Different solutions work for
different people. If the shoe
doesn't fit, don't blame the foot.

This section is all about helping you:
« Make cleaning semi-entertaining
© Organize your physical and digital spaces
« Stop wasting time on unimportant things
Find strategies that work at least some of the

time, so you can cycle through them as soon
as your enthusiasm for one starts to fade

DISORGANIZED

My advice?

le

Forget trying to follow conventional
organizational techniques that work for
other people, but not you. Otherwise,
you'll set yourself up to fail (and likely kill
your self-esteem in the process).

2. Focus on creating a unique system that

works with your existing behavior instead
of against it—even if it doesn’t make sense
to anyone else.

3. Start paying attention to where you

already end up dumping stuff.
Who cares where things are “supposed”

to go? If your clothes always end up on the

bathroom floor before you shower, get a
laundry hamper and put it in that corner.

4. Let go of the idea you'll find one "magic"

system that will work for you forever.

DISORGANIZATION LOOKS LIKE:

Using surfaces (and floors) as piling areas

Frequently losing items

“Dumping” instead of putting away

Poor life maintenance & self-care

Starting with "fun" instead of "important"

Lack of structure and routines

Difficulty breaking down large projects

Poor time management

Forgetting important tasks

Issues with planning and executing tasks

Doing too much at once

Shuffling piles around instead of cleaning

Items sitting in places they don't belong,

eventually fading into the background until
you barely notice they exist anymore

JAD SMITH

SCIENCE FICTION / LITERATURE

“Reading at times like a suspenseful career overview,
this engagingly written and insightful account of John Brunner’s
publishing struggles and literary aspirations will appeal to general
science fiction readers as well as scholars in the field.”

GARY K. WOLFE
AUTHOR OF EVAPORATING GENRES: ESSAYS ON FANTASTIC LITERATURE

nder his own name and numerous pseudonyms, John Brunner (1934-1995)

was one of the most prolific and influential science fiction authors of the late

twentieth century. During his exemplary career, the British author wrote

with a stamina matched by only a few other great science fiction writers and
with a literary quality of even fewer, importing modernist techniques into his
novels and stories and probing every major theme of his generation: robotics,
racism, drugs, space exploration, technological warfare, and ecology.

In this first intensive review of Brunner’s life and works, Jad Smith carefully
demonstrates how Brunner’s much-neglected early fiction laid the foundation for
his classic Stand on Zanzibar and other major works such as The Jagged Orbit, The
Sheep Look Up, and The Shockwave Rider. Making extensive use of Brunner’s let-
ters, columns, speeches, and interviews published in fanzines, Smith approaches
Brunner in the context of markets and trends that affected many writers of the
time, including Brunner’s uneasy association with the “New Wave” of science fic-
tion in the 1960s and ’70s. This landmark study shows how Brunner’s attempts
to cross-fertilize the American pulp tradition with British scientific romance com-
plicated the distinctions between genre and mainstream fiction and between hard
and soft science fiction and helped carve out space for emerging modes such as
cyberpunk, slipstream, and biopunk.

JAD SMITH is an associate professor of English at Eastern Illinois University.

JOHN BERGER

Seeing comes before words. The child looks
and recognizes before it can speak.

But there is also another sense in which seeing
comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place
in the surrounding world; we explain that world with words,
but words can never undo the fact that we are surrounded by
it. The relation between what we see and what we know is
never settled.

gardening games

are different! They're basically the anti-mining games.

Animal Crossing is my go-to example
of a gardening game. It features:

A tightly bounded physical space

Aworld that goes on growing &
changing, even without the player's
involvement

Aworld that becomes more
interesting & alive as the player
spends more time there, not less

Gardening games represent an alternative way to use PCG in games.
AC runs its terrain generator exactly once: when you first launch the
game. Rather than generating billions of slightly different artifacts to
fuel the content furnace, it generates one artifact (the town) & asks
the player to take care of it as it evolves.

One key principle of gardening game design is that
relationships take time.

By distributing content primarily across time
rather than space, AC can remain interesting
indefinitely. Spending more time in the town
doesn’t deplete it, but enriches it with new

| stories and gradually deepening relationships.
Nothing is ever “used up”.

ort is the category of player furthest from the stan-
player. As game designer Mark Prensky explains, “What
“spoils a game is not so much the cheater who accepts the rules

doesn't play by them (we can deal with him or her), but the
nihilist who denies them altogether.”2 The cheater breaks the
tules but remains within the space of play. The spoil-sport is
: destructive, refusing to acknowledge the game altogether.

If one considers the self-contained nature of the magic circle,
the way that games create their own meanings and provide
their own goals, it is clear that games are strongly autotelic. We
borrow the term from psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,
who in his book Flow explains that “The term ‘autotelic’ derives
from two Greek words, auto meaning self and telos meaning
goal. It refers to a self-contained activity, one that is done not
with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply
because the doing itself is the reward.”6 When an experience is
autotelic, it is participation in the activity alone that counts.
Games are, to a greater or lesser extent, pursued for their own
sake, for their own intrinsic stimulation. Although there are
always some extrinsic reasons for play, there are always intrinsic
motivations as well. In playing a game, part of the incentive is
simply to play—and often, it is the prime motivator.

Because they have such a strong autotelic component, games
are largely non-utilitarian. Most forms of design serve an exter-
nal function, or utility. Architecture hoiecac and chek... 2
BY SAMUEL R. DELANY

Rule-Breaking as a Game Design Practice
Our discussion of rule-breaking is not just an explication of the
ways in which players break the rules of a game. It is a game
design schema, a way of looking at all games that offers a
framework for solving particular game design problems.
However, it is a different kind of chapter than the other formal
schema we encountered in our investigation of RULES.
g f rule-b

nany of

Player behavior is not universally law-abiding. Given any partic-
ular game, there are many ways to play it and many ways to
bend and break its rules. For game designers, this means that
you should never take players’ behavior for granted. You need
to assume that your game will be played not just by earnest
rule-followers, but by zealously dedicated players, inappropri-
ately unsportsmanlike players, brilliantly secretive cheaters,

fundamental adjustment in players’ attitudes towards the rules
of a game:

Once this freedom is established, once we have established why

we want to change a game and how we go about it, a remarkable
thing happens to us: We become the authorities.

No matter what game we create, no matter how well we are able
to play it, it is our game, and we can change it when we need to.
We don't need permission or approval from anyone outside our
community. We play our games as we see fit. Which means that
now we have at our disposal the means whereby we can always
fit the game to the way we want to play.

This is an incredible freedom, a freedom that does more than any
game can,a freedom with which we nurture the play community.
The search for the well-played game is what holds the community
together. But the freedom to change the game is what gives the

community its power4

questions of meaning. Designers are interested in the concept
of meaning for a variety of reasons, not least of which is the
fact that meaning is one of the basic principles of human
interaction. Our passage through life from one moment to the
next requires that we make sense of our surroundings—that
we engage with, interpret, and construct meaning. This very
human movement toward meaning forms the core of interac-
tion between people, objects, and contexts.

From Economism to Earth

Environmentalism heretofore has been generally known as a “safe,”
middle-class issue. Who could be against clean air and water, tidying up
the neighborhood, recycling and preserving species and wilderness? This
was the kind of platform on which George Bush felt comfortable and
which was even espoused by Britain’s Margaret Thatcher.’ However, the
further one is drawn into environmental issues, the more the truth—long-
Tecognized by environmentalists—emerges. Environmentalism implies

erman refugees, and the appeal for assistance to help-

i On the other hand it proposes a substantial
modification of the immigration policy which the United
States adopted after an unfortunate.experience with im-
migration, and I am loathe,to vote for: any modification
of that policy. I do not think anything is more re-
sponsible for our present condition than the unrestrict-
ed immigration before the world war, tthich provided
cheap labor for the steel mills and the mines.

Particularly at the present time, I think it
unwise to encourage immigration. Nearly twenty million
people are dependent on the federal government for re-
lief. Among them are millions of children unable to
obtain a sufficient amount: of food, clothing and hous-
ing. It is said that the refugee children will be pro-
vided with homes, but if homes are available in America
.for twenty thousand children, then certainly there are
eat least 20,000 American cMildren whose condition could
be tremendously benefited by access*to such homes.
Furthermore, there is no assurance that in years to
come, when the additional children are looking for jobs,
conditions of unemployment will be better than now, and

When current is applied to the focus coil, it heats up, its resis

Instead, recent administrations have opted ts
tling the custodial sabre, but not only have to k
the additional funds that a rising prison Pp
they have on the altar of austerity slashed the pric. ites,
by a quarter. Between 2010 and 2015, the Naticeeiee budger
Management Service (NOMS), which, until 2017 Nc
was reimagined as HM Prison and Probation Service it
responsible for prisons in England and Wales, had its va m:
cut by £900 million.® In order to make nearly £1 billion of
savings, prison staffing levels were reduced by 30 per cent,
As of 2016, there were 13,720 fewer staff in the public
prison estate looking after 450 more people.**

In a drag race to the bottom, ‘benchmarking’ was intro-
duced, in which publicly run jails were required to peg their
costs to the same level as the ‘most efficient’ — read ‘cheap-
est’ — in the private sector. One of the reasons that private
sector prisons were so ‘efficient’ is that for seventeen years
they have had higher rates of overcrowding than public
sector prisons — shoving more prisoners into tinier spaces.”
A quarter of the prison population is overcrowded, with
prisoners doubling up in cells designed for one person,” in
order to secure an arbitrary 20 per cent reduction in the cost
of prison places (now at £35,000 per year).°” Around the
same time, Chris Grayling MP, Secretary of State for Justice
between 2012 and 2015, announced his populist plans to
make prisons, already hideous tombs of violence, death and
terror, ‘less lax’ and more ‘spartan’, introducing severe restric-
tions on prisoners’ ‘privileges’ — which famously included an
unlawful ban on prisoners being sent books38 — and displaying
a bizarrely prurient obsession with stopping inmates having

er moral standard is also ironically presented as just
struction, then satire is no longer an effective social critique
sunderstood as an example of the very thing it sets out
j ue” (2009; P- 860). Let us assume that a satirist’s true intention
to bea critique society through play and aggression in a way that
it es social oF political change. Though she may encourage tempo-
nay misreading of the text before the audience suddenly notes the irony
and inverts its meaning, the author ought to go to great lengths to be cer-
tain the literal interpretation is not what the reader is left with.

‘Admittedly, all of this logic is predicated on the idealistic assump-
tion that the author of such works is driven by the artistic, political, and
social goals of satire. In reality, contemporary satirists are employed by
for-profit entities that are themselves driven by economic and cultural
motives. The writers of the Onion are not Jonathan Swift, authoring a
piece of satirical literature with the goal of changing British policy toward
the poor. They are employees of a business—a growing business recently
purchased in part by Univision (James, 2016)—whose jobs and future de-
pend on page views, shares, and click-through rates. And yes, while the
writers of popular political satire like the Onion are surely hoping to suc-
cessfully critique people and issues, that same content is also what keeps
their media enterprise afloat, regardless of whether audiences read it as
ironic or literal. Undoubtedly, the goals of satire and the goals. of the mar-
ket are at odds here. A satirist wants a piece to be read ironically to reveal
the intended meaning and critique. A for-profit online satire publication
will benefit financially when individuals who mistakenly read the irony lit
erally click on and then share that story out of misplaced outrage.

‘This very tension is at the heart of current critiques of other self-
Proclaimed satire sites, including Empire News and the Daily Currant.
‘The Daily Currant publishes online fake news stories that have been mis-
takenly covered as real news by media organizations from ee

0.2 Studying in world politics: a reading
guide

Erzsébet Strausz, Anna Selmeczi and Shine Choi

Writing the world, reading ourselves

Itis 8:55 on a Tuesday. Lectures and seminars are about to Start. ‘Business
hours’ begin in offices, Meeting rooms, cafés. Some of us ‘only’ need to
make it to the classroom in the next ten minutes and find somewhere to
sit, though what follows is never only easy especially for those who have
to pry open crevices in a world that does not seem to see them. Others will
have to set up the lecture slides first, focus and breathe, and make sure that
this time technology of the self or electronics doesn’t break down. Others
still have started even earlier (at 7am? 6am?), cleaning the floors, taking the
rubbish out. The staff of catering facilities must have been busy preparing
for the day for at least an hour already. Embedded in a milieu of simultane-
ously shared and unshared life-worlds, a caption on a construction site of
a university reads: ‘What if our search for knowledge changed the world
around us?”

At first this question sounds like a benign call for taking academic study

more seriously as a form and exercise of power that has the capacity to make
a difference to daily life and how we live in it. It underlines the desirability
of impactful scholarship and draws attention to the Possibility of social
transformation by means of knowledge. Yet, walking past similar posters
and advertising material every day on campus and elsewhere, one wonders
what impactful knowledge means and how a thing called knowledge moves,
shapes, causes change in the world around and in us in any meaningful
sense. No doubt it is a good thing to think big and imagine what sorts of
Pressing issues and questions academic knowledge could indeed answer,
even solve. But what if knowledge was already political and the world had
already been changed through our practices of knowing? What if this banner
is there to encourage and perhaps, remind us in a friendly and (seemingly)
innocent manner that research matters because, despite the power it conveys
and the effects it produces, it has been rendered mute, bureaucratic, and
instrumental.

couldn’t help but consider this accusation as the abdication of being
“part of the human family,” even if he suspected that the drive behind
artificial intelligence researchers like McCarthy, almost all of whom
are men, was all too human. “Women are said to have a penis envy,
but we are discovering that men have a uterus envy: there is something

reative that women can do and men cannot, that is, give birth to
new life,” he told an interviewer. “We now see evidence that men are
striving to do that. They want to create not only new life but better life,
with fewer imperfections. Furthermore, given that it is digital and so
on, it will be immortal so they are even better than women.””
Weizenbaum never could have imagined how the Know-It-Alls,
beginning in the 1990s, managed to amass real-world wealth and
power from the imaginary worlds on their screens and the submerged
urge to be the bestower of life. Elis later years were spent in Germany,
far removed-from-the-events-in Silicon Valley.’° However, in 2008, a
few months before he died in his Berlin apartment at age eighty-five,
Weizenbaum did share the stage at the Davos World Economic Forum
with Reid Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, and Philip
Rosedale, the chief executive of the pathbreaking virtual reality site
Second Life. Hoffman explained why LinkedIn was such an important

example of “social software”: “What happens is this is my expression

his head in disbelief. People were misleading each other about their

many high-performance materials, above all steel and aluminum.

Foreword

nterest in Dalit studies for students of Indian society as a distinct

a, without rebellion, is a le in
itself ade, especially during the Raj for the
‘betterment’ of the Dalits, but it needs to be remembered that these
were ameliorative efforts. It was left to Dr. Ambedkar to put the Dalit
question in the proper perspective.

In the mid-1970s, it transpired that as part of the then recently
started MPhil programme a course on Dalit studies was started in the
Department of Sociology, Panjab University, Chandigarh. Our putative
objective was to understand how it happens that such a massive system
of inequality can be sustained for such a long time. It soon appeared that
many of the then prevalent interpretations would not work. Take, for
example, Swami Dayanad Saraswati’s Shuddhi of the former ‘outcastes’
and their assimilation as full-fledged members of Hindu society. Or to
look at Gandhi's attempt to show that no work is either impure or is
below one’s dignity. One can cite numerous illustrations of genuinely

wider Islamic religion, remain contested. In this groundbreaking study, Jawid Mojaddedi reaches to
the heart of the matter by examining Rumi's teachings on walaya (Friendship with God) in light of
earlier discourse in the wider Sufi tradition and juridico-theological Islam. Walaya is not only central
to Rumi's teachings, but forms the basis for the celebration of intimacy, communication with the
Beyond Dogma Divine, and transcendence of conventional religiosity in his poetry. And yet walaya is the aspect of

Sowehe Massa Seren See Sufism which has proven the most difficult to reconcile with juridico-theological Islam.
In addition to its focus on Rumi, Beyond Dogma presents a perceptive analysis of the historical
development of the discourse on walaya in the formative centuries of Sufism. This period coincides
with the time when juridico-theological Islam rose to dominance, as reflected in the harmonizing
efforts of theoretical Sufi writings, especially the manuals of the tenth and eleventh centuries.
Mojaddedi's analysis facilitates a nuanced and contextualized evaluation of Rumi's teachings on
walaya, which had already attracted a range of views before his time: from arguments in favor of
its superiority to Prophethood, to guarantees of subordinate deference towards the Prophetic
heritage interpreted by juridico-theological scholars. In the process, Beyond Dogma enables a fresh
evaluation of the influential early Sufi manuals in their historical context, while also highlighting the
significance for juridico-theological scholars of fundamental dogma in the process of consolidating
their own dominance.

The tiger thought, ‘Well, it’s not a bad idea. Let me have
a drink first and then eat him in great comfort. ‘‘And thus thinking
he agreed to have a drink.

The friend offered him the water to drink and pretended to
be praying.

The tiger who was very thirsty, gulped down the entire pot
of poisoned water as soon as he had finished the last drop,
his throat started to burn and he died.

After destroying the tiger in this way, the friend went back

A JOURNEY OF THE LAND OF GOLD AND PEARLS
(TANGSA)

In very olden days, there lived a sly man. One day he collected
all the ashes which he found at his own house and at the houses
of many other people and left home telling the people that he
was going abroad to sell the ash.

During his journey while carrying the ashes, he took shelter
in the house of a merchant. After asking the man who he was
and where he was going, the merchant allowed him to spend
the night at his house and asked him to keep his bag of ashes
in the cowshed. But expressing fear that the cows would eat
up the ashes, the man said that if the cows ate up the ashes,
he would lose a lot of money.

When he heard the man say that the cows might eat the ashes,
the merchant felt very annoyed because he had not heard ever
before that cows ate ash, and he told the man that if his cow
actually ate up his ashes, then he would let him take away with

him in the morning all the heads of the cows which ate his ©
ashes.

The merchant had altogether about one hundred and fifty heads
of cattle. He kept the bag of ashes in the cowshed by his cowhard.

After the dinner was over, the man turned in for the night
and soon pretended to have fallen asleep.

When later at midnight all the members of the house were
lying fast asleep, the man rose from his bed and quietly slipped
into the cowshed, rubbed ashes on the mouths of about the
best forty cows in the herd and slip back into his bed as quietly

Abstract
This paper explores vicious circles in organizations. Departing from some elementary notions of action theory and

cybernetics, it analyzes the dynamics, the clustering, and the survival chances of vicious circles. It argues that the action
perspective, taken to its logical conclusion, implies that many structural suboptimalities of organizations, such as

"I don't trust anyone who drinks rum and smokes a pipe,' said Granny.

"Nanny Ogg smokes a pipe and drinks anything,' Magrat pointed out.

"Yes, but that's because she's a disgustin' old baggage,' said Granny, without looking up.

Nanny Ogg took her pipe out of her mouth.

'That's right,' she said amiably. "You ain't nothing if you don't maintain an image.’

Granny looked up from the lock.

‘Can't shift it,' she said. 'It's octiron, too. Can't magic it open.'

It's daft, locking us up,' said Nanny. 'I'd have had us killed.'

"That's because you're basically good,' said Magrat. 'The good are innocent and create justice. The bad are
guilty, which is why they invent mercy.'

"No, I know why she's done this,' said Granny, darkly. 'It's so's we'll know we've lost.'

"But she said we'd escape,' said Magrat. 'I don't understand. She must know the good ones always win in the
end!'

‘Only in stories,' said Granny, examining the door hinges. 'And she thinks she's in charge of the stories. She
bends them round herself. She thinks she's the good one.’

"Mind you,' said Magrat, 'I don't like swamps. If it wasn't for the frog and everything, I'd see Lily's point - '

'Then you're nothing but a daft godmother,’ snapped Granny, still fiddling with the lock. 'You can't go around
building a better world for people. Gmlylpeoplelcan buildialbetter worldforpeoplen Otherwise it's just a cage.
Besides, you don't build a better world by choppin' heads off and giving decent girls away to frogs.'

"But progress - ' Magrat began.

"Don't you talk to me about progress. Progress just means bad things happen faster. Anyone got another
hatpin? This one's useless.'
She strode down the steps, and then cupped her hands around her mouth.

'Coo-ee! Mrs Gogol!’

Baron Saturday stopped speaking. Mrs Gogol nodded at Granny.

"Yes, Miss Weatherwax?!'

"Mistress,' snapped Granny, and then softened her voice again.

'This ain't right, you know. She's the one who ought to rule, fair enough. And you used magic to help her this
far, and that's all right. But it stops right here. It's up to her what happens next. You can't make things right by

magic. You can only stop making them wrong.’

Mrs Gogol pulled herself up to her full, impressive height. 'Who's you to say what I can and can't do here?'
"We're her godmothers,' said Granny.

'That's right,’ said Nanny Ogg.

"We've got a wand, too,' said Magrat.

"But you hate godmothers, Mistress Weatherwax,' said Mrs Gogol.

‘We're the other kind,’ said Granny. 'Weltelthelisind|thatigives|people|what\they snow they meallymeedymot

Among the fascinated crowd several pairs of lips moved as people worked this out.
'Then you've done your godmothering,' said Mrs Gogol, who thought faster than most. 'You did it very well."
"You didn't listen,' said Granny. 'There's all sorts of things to godmotherin'. She might be quite good at

ruling. She might be bad at it. But she's got to find out for herself. With no interference from anyone.'

"What if I say no?'

"Do you know how long I worked to win?' said Mrs Gogol, haughtily. 'Do you know what I lost?
Lily took the stick out of Granny's hands, and inspected it.

"Never used one of these things,' she said. 'You just sit on it and away you go?'

"With this one you have to be running quite fast before it takes off,' said Granny, 'but that's the general idea,
yes.'

'Hmm. Do you know the symbology of the broomstick?! said Lily.

Is it anything to do with maypoles and folksongs and suchlike?' said Granny.

'Oh, yes.'

'Then I don't want to hear about it.'

'No,' said Lily. 'I imagine you don't.'

She handed the stick back.

I'm staying here,' she said. 'Mrs Gogol may have come up with a new trick, but that doesn't mean she has
won.'

"No. Things have come to an end, see,' said Granny. 'That's how it works when you turn the world into

"You've got to put on your red-hot shoes and dance the night away?' said Lily.

'Somethin' like that, yes.'

"While everyone else lives happily ever after?’

"I don't know about that,' said Granny. 'That's up to them. What I'm sayin' is, you're not allowed to go round

"You know a Weatherwax never loses,' said Lily.

However, there are programs that execute correctly if subgoals, facts, and rules are
entered one way but go into an infinite loop or have a run-time error if the order
changes (Ghezzi 87, pp. 304~306).

Expert Systems
Expert systems can be considered declarative programming because the
programmer does not specify how a program is to achieve its goal at the level of
an algorithm. For example, in a rule-based expert system, any rule may become
activated and put on the agenda if its LHS matches the facts. The order in which
the rules were entered does not affect which rules are activated. Thus, the program
statement ordet does not specify a rigid control flow. Other types of expert
systems are based frames, discussed in Chapter 2, and inference nets, discussed
in Chapter 4.

There are a number of differences between expert systems and conventional
programs. Table 1.13 lists some typical differences.

Characteristic Conventional Program Expert System
Control by... Statement order Inference engine
Control and data Implicit integration Explicit separation
Control strength Strong Weak
Solution by... Algorithm Rules and inference
Solution search Small or none Large
Problem solving Algorithm is correct Rules
Input Assumed correct Incomplete, incorrect
Unexpected input Difficult to deal with Very responsive
Output Always correct Varies with problem
Explanation None Usually
Applications Numeric, file, and text Symbolic reasoning
Execution Generally sequential Opportunistic rules
Program design Structured design Little or no structure
Modifiability Difficult Reasonable
Expansion Done in major jumps Incremental

Oil Palm
A Global History

By Jonathan E. Robins

Oil palms are ubiquitous—grown in nearly every tropical country, they supply the world with more
edible fat than any other plant and play a role in scores of packaged products, from lipstick and soap to
margarine and cookies. And as Jonathan E. Robins shows, sweeping social transformations carried the
plant around the planet. First brought to the global stage in the holds of slave ships, palm oil became a
quintessential commodity in the Industrial Revolution. Imperialists hungry for cheap fat subjugated
Africa’s oil palm landscapes and the people who worked them. In the twentieth century, the World Bank
promulgated oil palm agriculture as a panacea to rural development in Southeast Asia and across the
tropics. As plantation companies tore into rainforests, evicting farmers in the name of progress, the oil
palm continued its rise to dominance, sparking new controversies over trade, land and labor rights,
human health, and the environment.

By telling the story of the oil palm across multiple centuries and continents, Robins demonstrates how
the fruits of an African palm tree became a key commodity in the story of global capitalism, beginning in
the eras of slavery and imperialism, persisting through decolonization, and stretching to the present

First published by UNC Press in 1972, Sugar and Slaves presents a vivid portrait of English life in the
Caribbean more than three centuries ago. Using a host of contemporary primary sources, Richard Dunn
traces the development of plantation slave society in the region. He examines sugar production
techniques, the vicious character of the slave trade, the problems of adapting English ways to the tropics,
and the appalling mortality rates for both blacks and whites that made these colonies the richest, but in
human terms the least successful, in English America.

and peculiarities."--Journal of Modern History
