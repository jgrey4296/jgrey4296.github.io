** ABSTRACT
   A structure for analysing narrative data is suggested, one that distinguishes
   three parts in sequence: context (a heuristic to identify what knowledge is
   relevant given a kind of situation), scope (what is possible within that
   situation) and narrative elements (the detailed conditional and sequential
   structure of actions and events given the context and scope). This structure is
   first motivated and then illustrated with some simple examples taken from
   Sukaina Bharwani's thesis (Bharwani 2004). It is suggested that such a structure
   might be helpful in preserving more of the natural meaning of such data, as well
   as being a good match to a context-dependent computational architecture, and
   thus facilitate the process of using narrative data to inform the specification
   of behavioural rules in an Agent-Based Simulation. This suggestion only solves
   part of the 'Narrative Data to Agent Behaviour' puzzle â€” this structure needs to
   be combined and improved by other methods and appropriate computational
   architectures designed to suit it.
