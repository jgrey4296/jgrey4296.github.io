** ABSTRACT
   This paper identifies possible pitfalls of simulation modeling and suggests ways
   to prevent them. First, we specify five typical pitfalls that are associated
   with the process of applying simulation models and characterize the "logic of
   failure" (DÃ¶rner 1996) behind the pitfalls. Then, we illustrate important
   aspects of these pitfalls using examples from applying simulation modeling to
   military and managerial decision making and present possible solutions to them.
   Finally, we discuss how our suggestions for avoiding them relate to current
   methodological discussions found in the social simulation community.
