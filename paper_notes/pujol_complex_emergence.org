** ABSTRACT
   Small-world and power-law network structures have been prominently proposed as
   models of large networks. However, the assumptions of these models usually lack
   sociological grounding. We present a computational model grounded in social
   exchange theory. Agents search attractive exchange partners in a diverse
   population. Agent use simple decision heuristics, based on imperfect, local
   information. Computer simulations show that the topological structure of the
   emergent social network depends heavily upon two sets of conditions, harshness
   of the exchange game and learning capacities of the agents. Further analysis
   show that a combination of these conditions affects whether star-like,
   small-world or power-law structures emerge.
