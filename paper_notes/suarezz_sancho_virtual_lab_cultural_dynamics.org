** ABSTRACT
   This article presents a Virtual Laboratory that enables the researcher to try
   hypothesis and confirm data analysis about different historical processes and
   cultural dynamics. This Virtual Cultural Laboratory (VCL) is developed using
   agent-based modeling technology. Individuals' tendencies and preferences as well
   as the behavior of cultural objects in the transformation of cultural
   information are taken into consideration. In addition, the effect of local
   interactions at different scales over time and space is visualized through the
   VCL interface. Information repositories, cultural items, borders, population
   size, individual' tendencies and other features are determined by the user.
   Finally, the researcher can also isolate specific factors whose effect on the
   global system might be of interest to the researcher. All the code can be found
   at http://projects.cultureplex.ca/
** Summary
**** The Model
***** Agents
      Individuals - mobile, carry messages, have preferences and range of behaviours, limited storage.
      Repositories - immobile, preferences, tolerance, no learning, limited storage.
      Cultural Items - No reception, just a single message in memory.
***** Messages
***** Behaviours
      Reception, memory, learning, and emission
      Emmission : Dominant/Creative/Passive behaviours
