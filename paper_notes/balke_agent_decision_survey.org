** ABSTRACT
   When designing an agent-based simulation, an important question to answer is
   how to model the decision making processes of the agents in the system. A
   large number of agent decision making models can be found in the literature,
   each inspired by different aims and research questions. In this paper we
   provide a review of 14 agent decision making architectures that have
   attracted interest. They range from production-rule systems to
   psychologically- and neurologically-inspired approaches. For each of the
   architectures we give an overview of its design, highlight research questions
   that have been answered with its help and outline the reasons for the choice
   of the decision making model provided by the originators. Our goal is to
   provide guidelines about what kind of agent decision making model, with which
   level of simplicity or complexity, to use for which kind of research
   question.
