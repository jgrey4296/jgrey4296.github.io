** ABSTRACT
   Institutions, the way they are related to the behaviour of the agents and to the
   aggregated performance of socio-economic systems, are the topic addressed by
   this essay. The research is based on a particular concept of a bounded rational
   agent living in society and by a population based simulation model that
   describes the processes of social learning. From simple co-ordination problems,
   where conventions spontaneously emerge, to situations of choice over alternative
   constitutional rules, simulation was used as a means to test the consistency and
   extract the implications of the models. Institutions, as solutions to recurring
   problems of social interaction, are both results and preconditions for social
   life, unintended outcomes and human devised constraints. In an evolutionary
   setting no support is found for the deep rooted beliefs about the 'naturally'
   beneficial outcomes generated by 'invisible-hand' processes or by any
   alternative Hobbesian meta-agency.
