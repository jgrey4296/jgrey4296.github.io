** ABSTRACT
   The article argues that using cellular automata (CA) is a promising modelling
   approach to understand social dynamics. The first section introduces and
   illustrates the concept of CA. Section 2 gives a short history of CA in the
   social sciences. Section 3 describes and analyses a more complicated model of
   evolving support networks. The final section summarises the advantages of the CA
   approach.
