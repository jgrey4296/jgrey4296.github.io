** ABSTRACT
   This paper discusses some of the merits of the use of formal logic in
   multi-agent systems and agent-based simulation research. Reasons for the
   plethora of formal systems are discussed as well as how formal systems and
   agent-based social simulation can work together. As an example a formal system
   for describing social relationships and interactions in a multi-agent system is
   presented and how this could benefit from agent-based social simulation as well
   as make a contribution is discussed.
