** ABSTRACT
   Cultures can be viewed as sets of beliefs and techniques allowing societies to
   cope with their environment. We here propose simple and explicit schemes showing
   how fishermen could encode beliefs about a renewable resource, fish. We then
   discuss the dynamics of the society, represented by economic and cultural
   variables, coupled to the fishery represented by fish abundance. According to
   different coding schemes and sets of parameters, several dynamical regimes are
   observed, including one with endogenous crises.
