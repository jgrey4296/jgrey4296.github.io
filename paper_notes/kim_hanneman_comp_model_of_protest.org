** ABSTRACT
   This paper presents an agent-based model of worker protest. Workers have
   varying degrees of grievance depending on the difference between their wage
   and the average of their neighbors. They protest with probabilities
   proportional to grievance, but are inhibited by the risk of being
   arrestedâ€”which is determined by the ratio of coercive agents to probable
   rebels in the local area. We explore the effect of similarity perception on
   the dynamics of collective behavior. If workers are surrounded by more
   in-group members, they are more risk-taking; if surrounded by more out-group
   members, more risk-averse. Individual interest and group membership jointly
   affect patterns of workers protest: rhythm, frequency, strength, and duration
   of protest outbreaks. Results indicate that when wages are more unequally
   distributed, the previous outburst tends to suppress the next one, protests
   occur more frequently, and they become more intensive and persistent. Group
   identification does not seriously influence the frequency of local uprisings.
   Both their strength and duration, however, are negatively affected by the
   ingroup-outgroup assessment. The overall findings are valid when workers
   distinguish 'us' from 'them' through simple binary categorization, as well as
   when they perceive degrees of similarity and difference from their neighbors.
