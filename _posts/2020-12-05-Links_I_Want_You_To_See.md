First off:
I realize this is an explosion of information. Consume at your pace, I'm just being excitable.


Now:
[Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) by Brett Victor. His work on using technology
to assist in thinking is wonderful. Which continues can be seen in Nicky Case and Vi Hart's [Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/),
and Case's [How to Build a Better Ballot](http://ncase.me/ballot/).

Which is a point: Nicky Case built [Loopy](http://blog.ncase.me/loopy-a-post-mortem/) as a really simple way of describing systems.

For Systems thinking, do you know [Donella Meadows](http://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-resources/), known for 
[Leverage Points](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)
[The Global Village](http://www.empowermentresources.com/info2/theglobalvillage.html) metaphor? Her book "Thinking in Systems" [¹](#references) is wonderful.

The Women in Computing work of [Mar Hicks](http://marhicks.com/syllabi.html#womenincomputing) is great, as is Hacking the Cis-term [²](#references).


Are you familiar with interactive fiction? As a means for alternative, and playful, way of exploring complex subjects, its a possibility.
In which case Allison Parish's [Twine Tutorial](http://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/) is a good intro. Twine was used to prototype
the Black Mirror IF 'Bandersnatch', and also has works like Kris Ligman's [You Are Jeff Bezos](http://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos).

[xkcd](http://xkcd.com)?
