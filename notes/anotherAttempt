* Socio-Institutional Action

** Introduction


*** What is Socio-Institutional Action?

Human behaviour operates on numerous levels of
abstraction. Individual, personal relations such as family
and friends. Institutional interactions in schools and
churches. More abstracted interactions such as mass media,
with cultural norms and values even further abstracted. All
of these combine to create the rich and complex society and
social interactions that we observe every day.

Current computational social models focus primarily on the
less abstracted, interpersonal interactions of
individuals, in the form of games like Prom Week and
Versu. On the other end of the scale there are 4X games such
as Civilisation that deal with highly abstracted concepts of
society. Between these two extremes is a level of human
behaviour currently invisible in computational models and
game design. Let us define this intermediate level of
behaviour as Socio-Institutional Action (SIA).

SIA characterises behaviour that bridges interpersonal
interactions with structurally modifying consequences. The
easiest example of SIA is politics. The ways in which
individuals in positions of power define and create the laws
by which others live. Consider the personal interactions
that are required in tv shows such as House of Cards and The
West Wing to bring about political actions. 

*** What is it different from?

SIA contrasts significantly with the majority of current
architectures, games, and discussions. Structural Change in
games is typically a factor of the narrative rather than the
system within which a player operates. Games such as
Civilisation presumes no resistance to making changes to a
society. Prom Week does not question the system which in a
school prom occurs and does not model the power
differentials of teachers to students. The Sims lets players
control agents behaviours and accomodations, but not the
society in which they operate. SimCity Societies approaches
concerns of different societies, but, as Fable 3 does,
limits itself to societal traits with relatively little
freedom. Democracy 3 abstracts political change and relies
on explicitly defined policies. 

In contrast, consider The Wolf Among Us, and Dragon Age
Origins. They place particular individuals in positions that
will decide the fate of many others. Unfortunately, they are
explicitly authored narratives, rather than simulated
societal changes. 


*** Why is it important?

Videogames are well suited to explore through simulation
issues challenging society at the moment. The possibility of
being able to role play in varieties of different social
configurations can provide a large number of learning
experiences. Institutionalised racism, command rape,
discrimination, welfare. Simulated societies provide the
possibility for individuals to understand the challenges
facing those who are different. 

One simple example would be a computational implementation
of Rawl's 'Veil of Ignorance' thought
experiment. Implementing the capability of players to select
the rules by which a society works, without having control
or foreknowledge of their own position in society, is a
compellingly different gameplay experience.

*** What are some good examples of it?

In games, examples of actual SIA's are few and far between. Some of
the best examples are recent Telltale games like the Wolf Among Us and
Tales from the Borderlands. Games that place critically important
decisions to shape the future course, not of a narrative, but of a
society within a narrative, in the hands of the player. Fable 3
attempted something along those lines as well. 

In realms less game related, the West Wing, Neal
Stephenson's Anathem, and Robert Greene's the 48 Laws of
Power all provide numerous examples of individuals being in
the right place at the right time to change the course of a
society.

*** Research Questions
A number of research questions arise once the concept of SIA
has been brought to the fore, primarily:

**** How can we describe Socio-Institutional Actions?
**** Can we create dynamic societies within which SIA's can occur?
**** Can dynamic societies provide new media experiences?
**** How might we utilize dynamic societies in games?

Socio-institutional action, a level of individually observable
behaviour that takes into account more than personal motivations. The
majority of games and AI today have statically allocated allegiances
to factions, global communicative behaviour, and global cultural
norms. By foregrounding the social organisation of groups of agents, a
different type of social behaviour can be modelled.

Consider this problem from another angle. Current understandings of
action, and the criteria by which we judge 'social' intelligence in
AI, stems heavily from an ethnocentric viewpoint of modern, western
cultures. There are games such as Unrest and Never Alone are starting
to explore non-western and non-modern cultural descriptions. However,
the majority of games, even when dealing with fantasy settings such as
Skyrim, typically do not stray far from modern cultural concepts.

Consider a comparison between Skyrim and Metro:2033. In Skyrim
traveling to a different city does not bring about any important
changes in behaviour or social norms. I can rest assured that there
will be traders, a market economy, houses for families,and so on. I do
not need to consider that there will be vastly different social norms
as to how to successfully greet npc's, nor that i need to pay
attention to individuals behaviours to be able to survive.

Contrast this, somewhat, with Metro:2033. Although much more linear,
each metro station has it's own atmosphere, politics, and
allegiances. The factions are still static, but at least I get the
sense that they each have their own sets of values rather than being
cardboard cutouts of each other. The Reich, the Reds, the
Rangers... each have goals that can be expressed in opposition to the
other factions.

Now consider fiction such as Altered Carbon, or Gormenghast. In these,
there are multiple layers of social norms, centuries of tradition,
and goals that group individuals together. Part of the attraction of
seeing the characters in these works manipulate their situations is
that some things are inviolable, while others are not.

How could such variation and fluidity be achieved? There do exist social
simulations that enable individuals to have personal goals, and
interact with other agents in broad and complex ways. Yet there is no
capability to manipulate structural aspects of their lives. They can
not have realisable political goals.

Such viewpoints may bring about useful and novel play
experiences. Rawl's Veil of Ignorance is one such possibility if we
can author societies instead of individuals. Allowing a player in an
RPG to roll a society, with their character being placed in that
society randomly, may enable a level of cultural criticism and
exploration not currently feasible. Current events such as Trayvon
Martin and Eric Garner have highlighted the consequences of ingrained
cultural views on particular classes of people, both police and
minorities. To be able to allow players to explore the difficulties of
living in particular societies that on the face of it are entirely
just, but only become problematic when power differences become
apparent, would be a valuable contribution to society.

*** Theory
   
*** Sociology

There is a whole host of sociological, philosophical, and
anthropological literature that goes into various ways of describing
and reasoning about such structures in human lives. Discussion of
power by Bourdieu, Greene, and Levi-martin. Considerations of cultural
structures include people such as Bill Bryson, Norbert Elias, and Ruth
Benedict. There is a whole host of literature in organisational theory
by Powell and Dimaggio, Fligstein and McAdam, and many others.

All of the above examples provide usable resources with which to add
higher level structures onto existing personally focused social models.


*** AI

In applied Artificial Intelligence, there are the two primary social
models of CiF and Praxis. There are considerations of continued
actions interrupted by other higher importance actions by Bryson with
Bod and Posh. Castelfranchi, spanning philosophy and AI, has
considered different levels of social actions.
