* On Inserting Ritual structure into  social interactions

** The Question
   Can a ritualistic or tribal society be
   procedurally generated over the top of CiF
   and/or Praxis?

** Clarification

   Tribal Societies defined as group structures,
   that provide a number of:
   a) transformative representations of a society's
   reality (ie: war parties => dancing)
   b) Consequential, irremedial, irrevocable acts
   c) a Stake in the proceedings
   d) status change
   e) use of space
   f) marking of time
   g) display / reaffirmation of relation
   h) power structure / authority
   i) hygene, courtesy, norms,
   j) information transfer / indoctrination
   h) social action
   i) signaling modification of a different rule

** Example: Gormenghast
** Example: Schechner


** How

** The Conclusion

   
* Towards Implementing Degrees of Social Action
  Specifically, Castelfranchi's degrees of Social
  Action, in a CiF or Praxis like framework.

** The 5 Degrees:
*** Interference and Dependence
*** Weak Social Action
    Based on social beliefs on other's actions.
*** Delegation
    weak: non-communicative
    by induction
    strong: communicative
*** Strong Social Action
    cognitive delegation
*** Social goal adoption
    compliance


* On Scaling up from Ritual Structures to Institutional Activity

** The Question
   Can a ritualistic/tribal society generation
   scheme be scaled up to deal with Institutional Activity?
   
** Clarification

   Institutional Activity meaning the above
   ritualistic activities, manipulated using the
   above degrees of social action, to provide
   variance of the type of influence a set of
   rules, or an institution, has. (In the form of
   the 4 forms of influence martin identifies:
   contagion, pressure, diffusion, and authority)

** Conclusion
