** Socio-Institutional Actions. 
*** Introduction:
If we characterise the scope of systems surrounding an individual in the way of Bronfenbrenner:
a) Individual
b) Microsystem
c) Meso System
d) ExoSystem
e) MacroSystem

Then I am proposing a system that, leveraging the interpersonal
capabilities of CiF and Praxis, enables actions on a dynamic higher
system. Actions that, due to the authorizations and culture of a
society, have a greater impact that on just the relationship with the
other person, while that interpersonal aspect remains a factor.

This has a broad structure of:
Individual -> Speech Acts -> Social Fields Changes -> Individual Behaviour Changes

A Core component of this is Gidden's discussion of routinization,
regularization, and time.

 Considering Speech acts as pragmatically sufficient metavocabularies to bootstrap social field manipulations to.

Steerpike and Lecter. Sociopathic exploration of norm violation.
***** House of Cards 
***** Hannibal.

**** private life
**** Political Economy of Noise. 
On the effects of technologies on a culture.
**** By the sword. 
For linking with Social Roguelikes and Fencing.
** Methods: 
*** Machine Learning. 
Classifiers and Repeated Relearning on multiple scales of simulation. 
***Bloom filters
as a particular form of guaranteed classification
*** Cellular Autonoma,
*** Genetic Algorithms,
*** Rete Net Pattern matching
making larger numbers of rules feasible, allowing generation of large sets of rules.

Statistical support for arguments:
wow analysis
novel progression and change nlp


** Resulting Games 
*** Social Roguelike 
Court Politics, Fencing, Highly Formal Rituals.  Rather than combat to get
through to the next level, you're talking your way in.
