Dennet - Rapoport's Rules

----Pinker:
https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Academics-Writing-Stinks/148989

Clear and Simple as the Truth - Thomas and Turner:
romantic, oracular, prophetic, pratical, plain styles
male generic writer, female generic reader
Classic style. Not using the occasion to sort out what he thinks.

Bad:
metadiscourse. Use signposts sparingly.
    contrast "this chapter discusses..." with "What makes..."
professional narcissism. 
apologising
shudder quotes
hedging: (almost, apparently, comparatively, fairly, in part, nearly,
partially, predominantly, presumably, rather, relatively, seemingly,
so to speak, somewhat, sort of, to a certain degree, to some extent,
and the ubiquitous I would argue.)
metaconcepts and nominalizations: –ance, –ment, or –ation. (zombie nouns)



classic style:
Conversational, so can use 'we'
better to qualify than hedge.
