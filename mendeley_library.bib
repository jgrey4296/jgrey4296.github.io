This political andideological movement has arisen in reaction toreconﬁgurations of power, wealth, and identity thatare endemic to global neoliberalism. In the UnitedStates, however, the media's dominant “blue-collarnarrative” about Trump's victory simpliﬁes therelationship between neoliberalism and nationalistpopulism by ignoring the role of the pettybourgeoisie and the wealthy in Trump's coalition. Ananthropology of Trump requires ethnographies ofcommunities largely shunned by anthropologists aswell as reﬂexivity about the unintended role ofuniversities in producing support for Trump.[neoliberalism, political parties, identity politics,class, race, Donald Trump, Brexit},

abstract = {Using a 1994 law change, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in the assignment of rent control in San Francisco to study its impacts on tenants and landlords. Leveraging new data tracking individuals' migration, we find rent control limits renters' mobility by 20{\%} and lowers displacement from San Francisco. Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15{\%} by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law. * We are grateful for comments from Ed Glaeser, Christopher Palmer, Paul Scott, and seminar and conference participants.},

abstract = {Models and experiments on adaptive decision-making typically consider highly simplified environments that bear little resemblance to the complex, heterogeneous world in which animals (including humans) have evolved. These studies reveal an array of so-called cognitive biases and puzzling features of behaviour that seem irrational in the specific situation presented to the decision-maker. Here we review an emerging body of work that highlights spatiotemporal heterogeneity and autocorrelation as key properties of most real-world environments that may help us understand why these biases evolved. Ecologically rational decision rules adapted to such environments can lead to apparently maladaptive behaviour in artificial experimental settings. We encourage researchers to consider environments with greater complexity to understand better how evolution has shaped our cognitive systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {After arguing about the crucial importance of trust for Agents and MAS, we provide a definition of trust both as a mental state and as a social attitude and relation. We present the mental ingredients of trust: its specific beliefs and goals, with special attention to evaluations and expectations. We show the relation between trust and the mental background of delegation. We explain why trust is a bet, and implies some risks, and analyse the most basic forms of non-social trust (reliance on objects and tools) to arrive at the more complex forms of social trust, based on morality and reputation. Finally we present a principled quantification of trust, based on its cognitive ingredients. And use this “degree of trust” as the basis for a rational decision to delegate or not to another agent. The paper is intended to contribute both to the conceptual analysis and to the practical use of trust in social theory and MAS},

Voice chat and text are the two primary methods of communicating however, in fast paced games, this is insufficient for making sophisticated plans. Giving players more non-verbal forms of communication could reduce the time necessary to develop plans which will likely increase the number of strategic plans used in first-person-shooters. By using information visualization techniques in games, we can provide players a faster method to communicate with their teammates, allowing teams to develop more complex plans quickly. We present ways in which player communication can be improved, reducing the necessary time to make effective strategic plans and increasing the amount of cooperative play amongst teammates. Using Source, a 3D game engine developed by Valve Corporation, we plan on developing a 'mod' to incorporate changes to further enable cooperative play. Once finished, we will determine the effectiveness of each tool by gathering and analyzing data from players.},

When the underlying runtime system does not provide fault tolerance transparently, classical approaches to implementing fault tolerance mechanisms often imply mixing functional programming with non-functional programming (e.g. error processing mechanisms). The use of reflection improves the transparency of fault tolerance mechanisms to the programmer and more generally provides a clearer separation between functional and non-functional programming. The implementations of some classical replication techniques using a reflective approach are presented in detail and illustrated by several examples, which have been prototyped on a network of Unix workstations.

In describing measurements, people prefer to use qualitative words like ‘tall' without precise applicability conditions, also known as vague words. The use of vague language varies widely across contexts, individuals, and tasks (single reference vs. comparisons between targets), but despite this variability, is used quite successfully. A potential strategy for using vague language is to leverage the set of alternative descriptors to settle on the best option. To determine whether people use this strategy, we conducted an experiment where participants picked vague words from sets of alternatives to describe either probability or color values. We varied the set of altenatives from which participants could choose. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that people use the set of available options to pick vague descriptors. The theoretical implications of this work are discussed.},

@book{Stolfo1991,
abstract = {Although the problem of increasing the speed of rule-based programs has been studied for a long while, so far the level of parallelism achieved under various parallel processing schemes fails to meet expectations of high performance gains. Most of the work has focused on manipulating existing rule programs to accommodate parallel architectures. However, without changing the inherently sequential algorithms encoded in rule form and without using intrinsic parallel rule languages to exploit parallelism, speedup is severely limited. In this paper we demonstrate that to maximize parallelism, manipulations must take place at the algorithmic level in addition to the program level. However, traditional rule languages are not equipped to easily express parallel algorithms. Thus, an inherently parallel rule language must be devised to enable maximum parallelism. We present our initial specification of such a language, named PARULEL. Preliminary performance results are detailed for one test case program. PARULEL is one part of a larger research effort that considers four key approaches to parallel rule processing: inherently parallel execution semantics; the use of redaction meta-rules to allow programmer control of the set of parallel instantiations; an incremental evaluation algorithm that incorporates, in an efficient manner, updates to the initial set of assumptions; and an algorithm that maps a program to a parallel architecture. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Essential to the selection of the next target for gaze or attention is the ability to compare the strengths of multiple competing stimuli (bottom-up information) and to signal the strongest one. Although the optic tectum (OT) has been causally implicated in stimulus selection, how it computes the strongest stimulus is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that OT neurons in the barn owl systematically encode the relative strengths of simultaneously occurring stimuli independently of sensory modality. Moreover, special "switch-like" responses of a subset of neurons abruptly increase when the stimulus inside their receptive field becomes the strongest one. Such responses are not predicted by responses to single stimuli and, indeed, are eliminated in the absence of competitive interactions. We demonstrate that this sensory transformation substantially boosts the representation of the strongest stimulus by creating a binary discrimination signal, thereby setting the stage for potential winner-take-all target selection for gaze and attention.},

abstract = {When, using Aspect Oriented Programming in the development of software components, a developer must understand the program units actually changed by weaving, how they behave, and possibly correct the aspects used. Support for rapid AOP prototyping and debugging is therefore crucial in such situations. Rapid prototyping is difficult with current aspect weaving tools because they do not support dynamic changes. This paper describes PROSE (PROgrammable ex-tenSions of sErvices), a platform based on Java which addresses dynamic AOP. Aspects are expressed in the same source language as the application (Java), and PROSE allows aspects to be woven, unwoven, or replaced at run-time.},

@article{Brown2011,
abstract = {Computing systems are becoming increasingly parallel and heterogeneous, and therefore new applications must be capable of exploiting parallelism in order to continue achieving high performance. However, targeting these emerging devices often requires using multiple disparate programming models and making decisions that can limit forward scalability. In previous work we proposed the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to provide high-level abstractions that enable transformations to high performance parallel code without degrading programmer productivity. In this paper we present a new end-to-end system for building, compiling, and executing DSL applications on parallel heterogeneous hardware, the Delite Compiler Framework and Runtime. The framework lifts embedded DSL applications to an intermediate representation (IR), performs generic, parallel, and domain-specific optimizations, and generates an execution graph that targets multiple heterogeneous hardware devices. Finally we present results comparing the performance of several machine learning applications written in OptiML, a DSL for machine learning that utilizes Delite, to C++ and MATLAB implementations. We find that the implicitly parallel OptiML applications achieve single-threaded performance comparable to C++ and outperform explicitly parallel MATLAB in nearly all cases.},

abstract = {Where do new research questions come from? This is at best only partially taught in courses or textbooks about clinical or epidemiological research. Methods are taught under the assumption that a researcher already knows the research question and knows which methods will fit that question. Similarly, the real complexity of the thought processes that lead to a scientific undertaking is almost never described in published papers. In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by "cultivating your thoughts". Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be "pruned". Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables. Then you are ready to carry out your research.},

Using a case study conducted in Tatarstan, which included interviews with criminal gang members and representatives of law enforcement agencies and analysis of secondary data, it argues that instead of a pattern of elimination or subjugation of Russian organized crime by the state, we see a mutually reinforcing ensemble which reproduces the existing social order. While both the strengthening of the state and organized crime actors' own ambitions led to their increasing integration into political structures, a complex web of interdependencies emerged in which actors from criminal networks and political authorities collaborated using each other's resources. This fusion and assimilation of members of the governing bureaucracy and members of an aspiring bourgeoisie coming from criminal backgrounds were as much the result of consensus and cooperation as of competition and confrontation.},

It can be used both as a reliable textbook for an introductory course and as a graduate text: on each topic it covers all the basic material in full detail, and adds one or two deeper results (again with detailed proofs) to illustrate the more advanced methods of that field. This second edition extends the first in two ways. It offers a thoroughly revised and updated chapter on graph minors, which now includes full new proofs of two of the central Robertson-Seymour theorems (as well as a detailed sketch of the entire proof of their celebrated Graph Minor Theorem). Second, there is now a section of hints for all the exercises, to enhance their value for both individual study and classroom use.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that politicians allocate public resources in ways to maximize political gains. But what is less clear is whether this comes at a cost to welfare; and if so, whether alternative electoral rules can help reduce these costs. In this paper, we address both of these questions by modeling and estimating politicians' decisions to allocate public funds. We use data from Brazil's federal legislature, which grants each federal legislator a budget to fund public projects in his state. We find that 26 percent of the public funds are distorted relative to a social planner's allocation. We then use the model to simulate several potential policies reforms to the electoral system, including adopting approval voting and implementing term limits. We find that an approval voting system reduces the distortions by 7.5 percent. Term limits also reduce distortions, but come at the cost of more corruption, which makes it a welfare-reducing policy.},

Here we demonstrate the viability of this approach by replicating the functionality of a full-featured and commercialscale behaviour tree AI within a non-commercial game framework. As well as demonstrating that layered Statecharts are both usable and amply expressive, our experience highlights the value of several, previously unidentified design considerations, such as sensor patterns, the necessity of subsumption, and the utility of orthogonal regions. These observations point towards simplified, higher-level AI construction techniques that can reduce the complexity of AI design and further enhance reuse.

abstract = {Massively Multiplayer Online (Role-Playing) Games (MMORPGs and MMOs) are highly complex socio-technical distributed systems. The thickly knitted web of relations among players is the backbone upon which their success (or failure) lies. For this reason, both game designers and managers should be aware of how - even the thinnest - features of the environment will impact on players. We can enlist among these apparently "minor" aspects Looting Systems (LSs), which help allocating valuable in-game objects, as fairly as possible, among the players. In the present work, we try to cast some light on the medium/long term effects of the adoption of different LSs on players' satisfaction (and hence on their "fidelity" to a specific game service). We adopt an agent-based approach to simulate the effects and drawbacks of LSs on different player bases (according to Bartle's player types), demonstrating that a relation among LSs and players' satisfaction with the game service could really exists, and that an appropriate choice of the LS could affect the distribution of player types in the game community, thus offering hints for reflection and further investigation to MMOs/MMORPGs developers. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@book{C.Solomon2004,
abstract = {The turn of the nineteenth century marked a rich and exciting explosion of philosophical energy and talent. The enormity of the revolution set off in philosophy by Immanuel Kant was comparable, by Kant's own estimation, with the Copernican Revolution that ended the middle ages. The movement he set in motion, the fast-moving and often cantankerous dialectic of “German Idealism,” inspired some of the most creative philosophers in modern times: including G.W.F.Hegel and Arthur Schopenhauer as well as those who reacted against them—Marx and Kierkegaard, for example. This volume traces the emergence of German Idealism from Kant and his predecessors through the first half of the nineteenth century, ending with the “irrationalism” of Kierkegaard. Each chapter has been written by a distinguished scholar in the field, and contributors include Lewis White Beck (on the German background), Daniel Bonevac, Don Becker, Patrick Gardiner (on Kant), Daniel Breazeale (on Fichte and Schelling), Robert C.Solomon, Willem deVries and Leo Rauch (on Hegel), Kathleen M.Higgins (on Schopenhauer), Robert Nola (on the Young Hegelians, including Marx) and Judith Butler (on Kierkegaard). The Age of German Idealism provides a broad, scholarly introduction to the period for students of philosophy and related disciplines, as well as some original interpretations of these authors. It includes a glossary of technical terms and a chronological table of philosophical, scientific and other important cultural events. Robert C.Solomon is Quincey Lee Centennial Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin. Kathleen M.Higgins is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin.},

abstract = {Sophisticated attackers find bugs in software, evaluate their exploitability, and then create and launch exploits for bugs found to be exploitable. Most efforts to secure software attempt either to eliminate bugs or to add mitigations that make exploitation more difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new defensive technique called chaff bugs, which instead target the bug discovery and exploit creation stages of this process. Rather than eliminating bugs, we instead add large numbers of bugs that are provably (but not obviously) non-exploitable. Attackers who attempt to find and exploit bugs in software will, with high probability, find an intentionally placed non-exploitable bug and waste precious resources in trying to build a working exploit. We develop two strategies for ensuring non-exploitability and use them to automatically add thousands of non-exploitable bugs to real-world software such as nginx and libFLAC; we show that the functionality of the software is not harmed and demonstrate that our bugs look exploitable to current triage tools. We believe that chaff bugs can serve as an effective deterrent against both human attackers and automated Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRSes).},

It is argued that whether a shift in the burden of proof occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion dialogues about the burden of proof. It is also shown that dialogues about the burden of proof are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

abstract = {Cooperative design has been an integral part of many games. With the success of games like Left4Dead, many game designers and producers are currently exploring the addition of cooperative patterns within their games. Unfortunately, very little research investigated cooperative patterns or methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a set of cooperative patterns identified based on analysis of fourteen cooperative games. Additionally, we propose Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPM). To evaluate the use of these CPMs, we ran a study with a total of 60 participants, grouped in 2-3 participants per session. Participants were asked to play four cooperative games (Rock Band 2, Lego Star Wars, Kameo, and Little Big Planet). Videos of the play sessions were annotated using the CPMs, which were then mapped to cooperative patterns that caused them. Results, validated through inter-rater agreement, identify several effective cooperative patterns and lessons for future cooperative game designs.},

@article{Haas2017,
abstract = {This article explores how the interrelationship of power and temporality shapes the lived experiences and subjectivities of political asylum claimants in the United States. By lodging an asylum claim, migrants enter into a system that will, in effect, produce them as legitimate refugees deserving of protection or as illegitimate, “bogus” asylum seekers in need of expulsion. In this way, asylum claimants inhabit a dual positionality of citizen-in-waiting/deportee-in-waiting, as they often spend many years waiting for the adjudication of their cases. This article ethnographically analyzes how this dual positionality is inhabited by asylum claimants, producing novel forms of suffering and being-in-the-world. More specifically, I argue that the asylum process evokes a sense of “existential limbo”: a subjective and temporal state of being in which the asylum system, in the present moment, is understood as the locus of suffering and in which life and meaning making are defined by a sense of immobility.},

This new emphasis on parallelism is supported by updates reflecting the newest technologies with examples highlighting the latest processor designs, benchmarking standards, languages and tools. As with previous editions, a MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. Along with its increased coverage of parallelism, this new edition offers new content on Flash memory and virtual machines as well as a new and important appendix written by industry experts covering the emergence and importance of the modern GPU (graphics processing unit), the highly parallel, highly multithreaded multiprocessor optimized for visual computing. A new exercise paradigm allows instructors to reconfigure the 600 exercises included in the book to easily generate new exercises and solutions of their own. A CD provides a toolkit of simulators and compilers along with tutorials for using them as well as additional problems and solutions, and references.},

This interaction represents a source of enforcement problems and transaction costs in the context of governing transactions. Institutional analytical frameworks used in agricultural economics should consider the particular properties of transactions involving natural systems. For ordering nature-related transactions, we propose a heuristic framework based on two dimensions: ‘modularity and decomposability of structures' and ‘functional interdependence of processes'. It serves as a starting point for establishing a typology ranging from ‘atomistic-isolated transactions' to ‘complex-interconnected transactions'. The complex process of institutionalising such transactions is decomposed into conceptual categories by means of a ‘transaction-interdependence cycle'.},

Specialized theme parks and various other leisure and entertainment centers worldwide are embracing the "interactive" promise that games have made users expect. This is not a trend limited to the entertainment domain; non-formal learning environments for children are also following this path, backed up by a theoretical notion of play as a core activity in a child's development. In this article we explore a central thread in learning, play, as well as an essential characteristic of virtual reality environments: interactivity. A critical review of examples of immersive virtual reality worlds created for children, with particular attention given to the role and nature of interactivity, is attempted. Interactivity is examined in relation to learning, play, narrative, and to characteristics inherent in virtual reality, such as immersion, presence, and the creation of illusion.},

abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has to date been largely one of manual labor. This constructionist approach to AI has resulted in systems with limited-domain application and severe performance brittleness. No AI architecture to date incorporates, in a single system, the many features that make natural intelligence general-purpose, including system-wide attention, analogy-making, system-wide learning, and various other complex transversal functions. Going beyond current AI systems will require significantly more complex system architecture than attempted to date. The heavy reliance on direct human specification and intervention in constructionist AI brings severe theoretical and practical limitations to any system built that way. One way to address the challenge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is replacing a top-down architectural design approach with methods that allow the system to manage its own growth. This calls for a fundamental shift from hand-crafting to self-organizing architectures and self-generated code – what we call a constructivist AI approach, in reference to the self-constructive principles on which it must be based. Methodologies employed for constructivist AI will be very different from today's software development methods; instead of relying on direct design of mental functions and their implementation in a cognitive architecture, they must address the principles – the “seeds” – from which a cognitive architecture can automatically grow. In this paper I describe the argument in detail and examine some of the implications of this impending paradigm shift.},

abstract = {One of the central results of AI research in the 1970's was that to achieve good performance, AI systems must have large amounts of knowledge. Machine learning techniques have been developed to automatically acquire knowledge, often in the form of if-then rules this often leads to a utility problem the learning" ends up causing an overall slowdown in the system. This is because the more rules a system has, the longer it takes to match them against the current situation in order to determine which ones are applicable. To address this problem, this thesis is aimed at enabling the scaling up of the number of rules in production systems. We examine a diverse set of testbed systems, each of which learns at least 100,000 rules. We show that with the best existing match algorithms, the match cost increases linearly in the number of rules in these systems. This is inadequate for large learning systems, because it leads to a utility problem. We then examine the causes of this linear increase, and develop techniques which eliminate the major causes. The end result is an improved match algorithm, Rete/UL, which is a general extension of the existing state-of-theart Rete match algorithm. Rete/UL's performance scales well on a signicantly broader class of systems than existing match algorithms. The use of Rete/UL rather than Rete signicantly reduces or eliminates the utility problem in all the testbed systems.},

Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learners interact with their environment and use their experience to choose or avoid certain actions based on the observed consequences. Actions that led to satisfactory outcomes (i.e. outcomes that met or exceeded aspirations) in the past tend to be repeated in the future, whereas choices that led to unsatisfactory experiences are avoided. The empirical study of reinforcement learning dates back to Thorndike's animal experiments on instrumental learning at the end of the 19th century (Thorndike, 1898). The results of these experiments were formalised in the well known `Law of Effect', which is nowadays one of the most robust properties of learning in the experimental psychology literature:``Of several responses made to the same situation those which are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the animal will, other things being equal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, they will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed by discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their connections to the situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will be less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond.'' (Thorndike, 1911, p. 244)Nowadays there is little doubt that reinforcement learning is an important aspect of much learning in most animal species, including many phylogenetically very distant from vertebrates (e.g. earthworms (Maier {\&} Schneirla, 1964) and fruit flies (Wustmann, 1996)). Thus, it is not surprising that reinforcement learning --being one of the most widespread adaptation mechanisms in nature-- has attracted the attention of many scientists and engineers for decades. This interest has led to the formulation of various models of reinforcement learning and --when feasible-- to the theoretical analysis of their dynamics. In particular, this chapter characterises the dynamics of one of the best known stochastic models of reinforcement learning (Bush {\&} Mosteller, 1955) when applied to decision problems of strategy (i.e. games).},

abstract = {Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the causal effect of health insurance on the utilization of care. Most studies cannot determine whether the large differences in healthcare utilization between the insured and the uninsured are due to insurance status or to other unobserved differences between the two groups. In this paper, we exploit a sharp change in insurance coverage rates that results from young adults “aging out” of their parents' insurance plans to estimate the effect of insurance coverage on the utilization of emergency department (ED) and inpatient services. Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and a census of emergency department records and hospital discharge records from seven states, we find that aging out results in an abrupt 5 to 8 percentage point reduction in the probability of having health insurance. We find that not having insurance leads to a 40 percent reduction in ED visits and a 61 percent reduction in inpatient hospital admissions. The drop in ED visits and inpatient admissions is due entirely to reductions in the care provided by privately owned hospitals, with particularly large reductions at for profit hospitals. The results imply that expanding health insurance coverage would result in a substantial increase in care provided to currently uninsured individuals.},

abstract = {Most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks.},

@article{Sayer2017,
abstract = {The term " post‐factual politics " (or " post‐truth politics "), which Wikipedia usefully defines as " a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion disconnected from the details of policy, and by the repeated assertion of talking points to which factual rebuttals are ignored, " has been widely employed in relation to Britain's EU referendum and the 2016 US presidential election. At issue here are not just particular lies, like the {\pounds}350 million per week Leave campaigners in the UK falsely claimed went to the EU, but the whole spirit in which the debates were conducted. Warnings of negative economic consequences of a pro‐Brexit vote were routinely dismissed as " Project Fear " —the implication being that is was unpatriotic even to question Britain's ability to prosper outside the EU. A will-ingness to ignore facts came close to being presented as a moral virtue. Michael Gove encapsulated this spirit in his claim that " people in this country have had enough of experts " —a remarkable statement to come from a former Sec-retary of State for Education. 1 On the other side of the Atlantic Donald Trump's contempt for facts scarcely needs documenting, but those interested might consult the Toronto Star's list of 560 falsehoods he uttered during the cam-paign on every conceivable topic from youth unemployment rates among African‐Americans to the numbers of Syrian refugees admitted to the USA by the Obama administration. 2 On Trump's first day in office White House press sec-retary Sean Spicer berated the press for understating the size of the crowds at the inauguration, insisting that this was " the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. " 3 When challenged with evidence that clearly showed the contrary, presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway described Spicer's falsehoods as " alternative facts. " 4 Such abuses of truth by the powerful do not augur well for the future of democracy, which depends on an informed electorate. My concern here, however, is not primarily with Westminster and the White House. It is with the extent to which left‐ wing analysis of the Brexit and Trump victories has become clouded by the same post‐factual fog. Perception of these victories as " upsets " or " shocks " is arguably itself a symptom of a political culture in which feeling and belief count for more than evidence or argument. No rational observer should have been surprised by these outcomes. In the British case, though most polls published during the last week of the campaign predicted a slender win for Remain, over the previous three weeks 17 out of 26 polls had predicted a Leave victory. 5 In the US, where most polls had shown a majority for Clinton for months, the gap sharply narrowed in the week before the election, leaving her with a bare 3.1{\%} lead on election day. 6 The US polls proved remarkably accurate, since in the event Clinton topped Trump by 2.1{\%} in the nationwide popular vote while Trump outperformed his national poll totals by only 1–2 percentage points. As Nate Silver has commented, " the result was not some sort of massive outlier; on the contrary, the polls were pretty much as accurate as they'd been, on average, since 1968. " 7 The last‐minute},

abstract = {This Handbook provides the hidden common threads that tie sociological inquiry together and, featuring eminent scholars, it separates itself from its predecessors in substance and organization. Rather than rehashing old debates or longingly gazing at the past, this book presents sociologists with new ways of conceptualizing the organization and presentation of sociological theory. At the heart of this Handbookℓ́ℓs vision is the twin goals of making theory a viable enterprise by reconceptualizing how we teach theory and keeping theory closely tied to its empirical applications. Three strategies are offered: (1) Elucidating how classic issues like integration or interaction are interrogated today; (2) Presenting a coherent vision of the social levels of reality that theorists work on such as communities, groups, and the self as well as how the coherence of these levels speaks to the macro-micro link; and, (3) Theorizing the social world rather than celebrating theorists or theories; that is, one can look at how theory is used holistically to understand the constraints the social world places on our lived experience or the dynamics of social change. Hence, in the second decade of the 21st century, it has become clear that sociology is at a crossroads as the number of theorists and amount of theory available is increasingly unmanageable and unknowable by the vast majority of professionals and students. As such, this Handbook of Contemporary Sociological Theory presents the novice and the expert with the a roadmap for traversing this crossroad and building a more coherent, robust, and cumulative sociology.},

abstract = {Serious games are gaining profile as a novel strategy to impact health behavior change in the service of national health objectives. Research has indicated that many evidence-based programs are effective because they are grounded in behavioral and motivational theories and models such as the PRECEDE model, the Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Transtheoretical Model, Attribution Theory, and the ARCS model. Such theories assist in understanding health behavior problems, developing salient interventions, and evaluating their effectiveness. It follows, therefore, that serious games can be made optimally effective in changing health behavior if they are also informed by these theories. A successful intervention development framework (Intervention Mapping) provides a means to enable game developers to use theory to inform the design of effective games for health. This chapter describes useful theories and models for health game design, introduces the intervention mapping process, and describes a case study of a theory- and empirically-based serious health game intervention that has used these approaches and has been rigorously evaluated},

abstract = {Recent work in cognitive psychology and social cognition bears heavily on con-cerns of sociologists of culture. Cognitive research confirms views of culture as fragmented; clarifies the roles of institutions and agency; and illuminates supra-individual aspects of culture. Individuals experience culture as disparate bits of information and as schematic structures that organize that information. Culture carried by institutions, networks, and social movements diffuses, activates, and selects among available schemata. Implications for the study of identity, collective memory, social classification, and logics of action are developed.},

In this paper, we detail the workings of a major new version of our social artificial intelligence system, Comme il Faut, that enables social game play in interactive media experiences. The workings of Comme il Faut 2 are shown, with running examples, from both knowledge representation and process perspectives. Finally, the paper concludes with a plan for evaluating and demonstrating Comme il Faut 2 through an implementation of an interactive media experience that consists of a playable social space.},

abstract = {A power describes the ability of an agent to act in some way. While this notion of power is critical in the context of organisational dynamics, and has been studied by others in this light, it must be constrained so as to be useful in any practical application. In particular, we are concerned with how power may be used by agents to govern the imposition and management of norms, and how agents may dynamically assign norms to other agents within a multi-agent system. We approach the problem by defining a syntax and semantics for powers governing the creation, deletion, or modification of norms within a system, which we refer to as normative powers. We then extend this basic model to accommodate more general powers that can modify other powers within the system, and describe how agents playing certain roles are able to apply powers, changing the systems norms, and also the powers themselves. We examine how the powers found within a system may change as the status of norms change, and show how standard norm modification operations such as the derogation, annulment and modification of norms may be represented within our system.},

There is always one more track to follow, one more mirage to explore. — Rosita Forbes Sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze. In this chapter you will learn how to modify and extend an agent-based model. We will do this by taking several classic models, examining how they work, and then discussing how to change and extend these models. Sometimes the modified models explore alterna-tive scenarios, variations on the original model. Other times, the modifications may lead to models of very different phenomena. During these explorations it is important to pay attention to four characteristic features of agent-based modeling: 1. Simple rules can be used to generate complex phenomena Many of the models that we will look into have very simple rules that do not require complex mathematical formulas or a deep understanding of the knowledge domain that they are attempting to model. Nonetheless, they are able to reproduce complex phe-nomena that are observed in the real world. For instance, a model of fire spread may have only a simple rule to describe fire spread from one tree to another, but it still may have interesting things to say about how likely a fire is to spread across an entire forest. 3},

@inproceedings{Mizoguchi1995,
abstract = {Normal human subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a simple visual manual reaction-time (RT) task with lateralized brief stimuli, the so-called Poffenberger's paradigm. This paradigm was employed to measure interhemispheric transmission (IT) time by subtracting mean RT for the uncrossed hemifield-hand conditions, that is, those conditions not requiring an IT, from the crossed hemifield-hand conditions, that is, those conditions requiring an IT to relay visual information from the hemisphere of entry to the hemisphere subserving the response. The obtained difference is widely believed to reflect callosal conduction time, but so far there is no direct physiological evidence in humans. The aim of our experiment was twofold: first, to test the hypothesis that IT of visuomotor information requires the corpus callosum and to identify the cortical areas specifically activated during IT. Second, we sought to discover whether IT occurs mainly at premotor or perceptual stages of information processing. We found significant activations in a number of frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical areas and in the genu of the corpus callosum. These activations were present only in the crossed conditions and therefore were specifically related to IT. No selective activation was present in the uncrossed conditions. The location of the activated callosal and cortical areas suggests that IT occurs mainly, but not exclusively, at premotor level. These results provide clear cut evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the crossed-uncrossed difference in the Poffenberger paradigm depends on IT rather than on a differential hemispheric activation.},

We trace its history as a response to the technological mediations and listening practices emergent in modernity and note its absence in the anthropological literature. We then trace the history of technology that gave rise to anthropological recording practices, film sound techniques, and experimental sound art, noting productive interweavings of these threads. After considering ethnographies that explore relationships between sound, personhood, aesthetics, history, and ideology, we question sound's supposed ephemerality as a reason for the discipline's inattention. We conclude with a call for an anthropology that more seriously engages with its own history as a sounded discipline and moves forward in ways that incorporate the social and cultural sounded world more fully.},

abstract = {A reflective programming language provides means to render explicit what is typically abstracted away in its language constructs in an on-demand style. In the early 1980s, Brian Smith introduced a general recipe for building reflective programming languages with the notion of procedural reflection. It is an excellent framework for understanding and comparing various metaprogramming and reflective approaches, including macro programming, first-class environments, first-class continuations, metaobject protocols, aspect-oriented programming, and so on. Unfortunately, the existing literature of Brian Smiths original account of procedural reflection is hard to understand: It is based on terminology derived from philosophy rather than computer science, and takes concepts for granted that are hard to reconstruct without intimate knowledge of historical Lisp dialects from the 1960s and 1970s. We attempt to untangle Smiths original account of procedural reflection and make it accessible to a new and wider audience. On the other hand, we then use its terminological framework to analyze other metaprogramming and reflective approaches, especially those that came afterwards.},

@article{Amin2017,
abstract = {Given a tower of interpreters, i.e., a sequence of multiple interpreters interpreting one another as input programs, we aim to collapse this tower into a compiler that removes all interpretive overhead and runs in a single pass. In the real world, a use case might be Python code executed by an x86 runtime, on a CPU emulated in a JavaScript VM, running on an ARM CPU. Collapsing such a tower can not only exponentially improve runtime performance, but also enable the use of base-language tools for interpreted programs, e.g., for analysis and verification. In this paper, we lay the foundations in an idealized but realistic setting. We present a multi-level lambda calculus that features staging constructs and stage polymorphism: based on runtime parameters, an evaluator either executes source code (thereby acting as an interpreter) or generates code (thereby acting as a compiler). We identify stage polymorphism, a programming model from the domain of high-performance program generators, as the key mechanism to make such interpreters compose in a collapsible way. We present Pink, a meta-circular Lisp-like evaluator on top of this calculus, and demonstrate that we can collapse arbitrarily many levels of self-interpretation, including levels with semantic modifications. We discuss several examples: compiling regular expressions through an interpreter to base code, building program transformers from modi ed interpreters, and others. We develop these ideas further to include reflection and reification, culminating in Purple, a reflective language inspired by Brown, Blond, and Black, which realizes a conceptually infinite tower, where every aspect of the semantics can change dynamically. Addressing an open challenge, we show how user programs can be compiled and recompiled under user-modified semantics.},

Identity pattern had similar relationships across sample with vector dimensions of the California Psychological Inventory but was related to work and family outcomes only in the younger cohorts, whose lives were less restricted. Women with the achieved-foreclosed pattern were more alike across cohort than women with the achieved-moratorium pattern. Among the latter, independence and high aspirations were salient salient features of the younger cohorts, whereas interest in motives of self and others were salient in the older cohort.},

Although there are many reasons to suspect that these laws could harm groups like racial minorities and the poor, existing studies have been limited, with most occurring before states enacted strict identification requirements, and they have uncovered few effects. By using validated voting data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study for several recent elections, we are able to offer a more definitive test. The analysis shows that strict identification laws have a differentially negative impact on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries and general elections. We also find that voter ID laws skew democracy toward those on the political right.},

abstract = {Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) where the agents are developed by different$\backslash$nparties and serve different interests, are often classified as `open'.$\backslash$nThe specification of open MAS is largely seen as a design-time activity.$\backslash$nMoreover, there is no support for run-time specification modification.$\backslash$nDue to environmental, social or other conditions, however, it is often$\backslash$nrequired to revise the MAS specification during its execution. To$\backslash$naddress this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic'$\backslash$nopen MAS specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at$\backslash$nrun-time by the agents. We adopt a bird's eye view of an open MAS, as$\backslash$nopposed to an agent's own perspective whereby it reasons about how it$\backslash$nshould act. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for$\backslash$nproposing a modification of the `rules of the game', as well as$\backslash$ndecision-making over and enactment of proposed modifications. We$\backslash$nevaluate proposals for rule modification by modelling a dynamic$\backslash$nspecification as a metric space, and by considering the effects of$\backslash$naccepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore, we constrain the$\backslash$nenactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation criteria. We$\backslash$nemploy the action language C+ to formalize dynamic specifications, and$\backslash$nthe `Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the$\backslash$nspecifications. We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic$\backslash$nspecification of a resource-sharing protocol.},

abstract = {Relationships between people who meet in virtual worlds are common and these relationships can be long term, in some cases lasting a life-time. Although relationships formed in virtual worlds have invited a lot of recent interest, surprisingly little work has been done on developing computer agents and non-player characters that can actively participate in such relationships. The focus of this review is relational agents, agents that can build long term socio-emotional relationships with users. In virtual worlds, such agents are just starting to emerge; they are more common in other environments but remain few and far between. This review critically assesses the progress of relational agent development and research since their inception in 2005, proposes new areas of research and considers the potential for their exploitation in virtual worlds.},

This review summarizes the rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of programs that aim to improve the reintegration and rehabilitation of the formerly-incarcerated.

abstract = {Clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning method for finding structure in the data. However, the resulting clusters are typically presented without any guarantees on their robustness; slightly changing the used data sample or re-running a clustering algorithm involving some stochastic component may lead to completely different clusters. There is, hence, a need for techniques that can quantify the instability of the generated clusters. In this study, we propose a technique for quantifying the instability of a clustering solution and for finding robust clusters, termed core clusters, which correspond to clusters where the co-occurrence probability of each data item within a cluster is at least {\$}1 - \backslashalpha{\$}. We demonstrate how solving the core clustering problem is linked to finding the largest maximal cliques in a graph. We show that the method can be used with both clustering and classification algorithms. The proposed method is tested on both simulated and real datasets. The results show that the obtained clusters indeed meet the guarantees on robustness.},

abstract = {Understanding the interaction of a user with a designed device such as a GUI requires clear understanding of three components: the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities of the user, the task to be accomplished and the artefact used to accomplish the task. Computational modeling systems which enable serious consideration of all these constraints have only recently begun to emerge. One such system is ACT-R/PM, which is described in detail. ACT-R/PM is a production system architecture that has been augmented with a set of perceptual-motor modules designed to enable the detailed modeling of interactive tasks. Nilsen's (1991) random menu selection task serves two goals: to illustrate the promise of this system and to help further our understanding of the processes underlying menu selection and visual search. Nilsen's original study, two earlier models of the task, and recent eye-tracking data are all considered. Drawing from the best properties of the previous models considered and guided by information from the eye-tracking experiment, a series of new models of random menu selection were constructed using ACT-R/PM. The final model provides a zero-parameter fit to the data that does an excellent, though not perfect, job of capturing the data. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.},

In the case of Wikipedia, the prevailing cultural norm is one that warns against ownership of one's work. However, we observe the emergence of territoriality in online space with respect to a subset of articles that have been tagged with the Maintained template through a qualitative study of 15 editors who have self-designated as Maintainers. Our participants communicated ownership, demarcated boundaries and asserted their control over artifacts for the sake of quality by appropriating existing features of Wikipedia. We then suggest design strategies to support these behaviors in the proper context within collaborative authoring systems more generally.},

abstract = {I argue here that functional neuroimaging data--which I restrict to the haemodynamic techniques of fMRI and PET--can inform psychological theorizing, provided one assumes a "systematic" function-structure mapping in the brain. In this case, imaging data simply comprise another dependent variable, along with behavioural data, that can be used to test competing theories. In particular, I distinguish two types of inference: function-to-structure deduction and structure-to-function induction. With the former inference, a qualitatively different pattern of activity over the brain under two experimental conditions implies at least one different function associated with changes in the independent variable. With the second type of inference, activity of the same brain region(s) under two conditions implies a common function, possibly not predicted a priori. I illustrate these inferences with imaging studies of recognition memory, short-term memory, and repetition priming. I then consider in greater detail what is meant by a "systematic" function-structure mapping and argue that, particularly for structure-to-function induction, this entails a one-to-one mapping between functional and structural units, although the structural unit may be a network of interacting regions and care must be taken over the appropriate level of functional/structural abstraction. Nonetheless, the assumption of a systematic function-structure mapping is a "working hypothesis" that, in common with other scientific fields, cannot be proved on independent grounds and is probably best evaluated by the success of the enterprise as a whole. I also consider statistical issues such as the definition of a qualitative difference and methodological issues such as the relationship between imaging and behavioural data. I finish by reviewing various objections to neuroimaging, including neophrenology, functionalism, and equipotentiality, and by observing some criticisms of current practice in the imaging literature.},

abstract = {As a student, educator, and researcher, I have long been interested in the learning opportunity that video games represent a corollary of a pedagogic awareness of the considerable benefit of applied and practical learning experiences.  The advent of low cost computing has increased ownership of personal computers in the last twenty years. A result of these decreasing costs has seen significant growth in household ownership of personal computing equipment for entertainment, education and enterprise. The increased ownership of personal computing equipment has also seen a significant increase of ownership and use of video games. The increase interest and use of video games for entertainment has seen a similar increase of interest in the use of video games for education.  In this paper, a proposed method is presented for obtaining a better understanding of the education potential of video games for young children.},

abstract = {Identifying whether an utterance is a statement, question, greeting, and so forth is integral to effective automatic understanding of natural dialog. Little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (DAs) can be automatically classified in truly natural conversation. This study asks whether current approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding prosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from the Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features (duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted for each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred; trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance. Performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the output of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task, as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to classification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although canonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious features could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each task, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially for the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.},

abstract = {Agent-based Modelling appears as a promising analytical tool when it comes to a lasting question: in how far did different institutions affect the social and economic outcomes of societies? Taking an incremental step to address this question, we present a refined approach that combines existing institution representations (the structure) with a norm identification process to systematically 'grow' normative understanding from the bottom up without relying on any prior knowledge. The proposed mechanism provides agents with the ability a) to detect complex normative behaviour by developing and differentiating stereotypes of social actors, and b) to generalise behaviour beyond observed social entities, giving agents the ability to develop normative understanding as a potential precursor for predicting newcomers' behaviours. We exemplify this approach using a simulated prototypical trader scenario that is evaluated with respect to behavioural diversity (different compositions of non-/cooperative agents) as well as structural diversity (different types of agents). Using the simulation results, we showcase the explanatory power of the derived normative understanding beyond the interpretation of quantitative results, and finally discuss the generalisability of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Within the ATAL community, the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model has come to be possibly the best known and best studied model of practical reasoning agents. However, it could be argued that the BDI model is now becoming somewhat dated: the principles of the architecture were established in the mid-1980s, and have remained essentially unchanged since then. With the explosion of interest in intelligent agents and multi-agent systems that has occurred since then, a great many other architectures have been developed, which, it could be argued, address some issues that the BDI model fundamentally fails to. The purpose of this paper is therefore to establish how the BDI model stands in relation to other contemporary models of agency, and where it should go next.},

abstract = {A dungeon, in the real world, is a cold, dark and dreadful place where prisoners are kept. A dungeon, in a computer game, is a labyrinthine environment where ad-venturers enter at one point, collect treasures, evade or slay monsters, rescue noble people, fall into traps and ultimately exit at another point. This conception of dun-geons probably originated with the roleplaying board game Dungeons and Drag-ons, and has been a key feature of almost every computer role playing game (RPG), including genre-defining games such as the Legend of Zelda series and the Final Fantasy series, and recent megahits such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Of par-ticular note is the " roguelike " genre of games which, following the original Rogue from 1980, features procedural runtime dungeon generation; the Diablo series is a high-profile series of games in this tradition. Because of this close relationship with such successful games, and also due to the unique control challenges in their design, dungeons are a particularly active and attractive PCG subject. For the purposes of this chapter, we define adventure and RPG dungeon levels as labyrinthic environments, consisting mostly of inter-related challenges, rewards and puzzles, tightly paced in time and space to offer highly structured gameplay progressions [13]. An aspect which sets dungeons apart from other types of levels is a sophisticated notion of gameplay pacing and progression: although dungeon levels are open for free player exploration (more than e.g. platform levels), this exploration has a tight bond with the progression of challenges, rewards and puz-zles, as intended by game designers. In contrast with e.g. platform levels or race tracks, dungeon levels encourage free exploration while keeping strict control over gameplay experience, progression and pacing (unlike open worlds, where the player is more independent). For example, players may freely choose their own dungeon path among different possible ones, but never encounter challenges that are impos-sible for their current skill level (since the space to back track is not as open as, for example, a sandbox city). Designing dungeons is thus a sophisticated exercise of emerging a complex game space from predetermined desired gameplay, rather than the other way around. 31 32 Noor Shaker, Antonios Liapis, Julian Togelius, Ricardo Lopes, and Rafael Bidarra In most adventure games and RPGs, dungeons structurally consist of several rooms connected by hallways. While originally the term 'dungeon' refers to a labyrinth of prison cells, in games it may also refer to caves, caverns, or human-made structures. Beyond geometry and topology, dungeons include non-player-characters (e.g. monsters to slay, princesses to save), decorations (typically fantasy-based) and objects (e.g. treasures to loot). Procedural generation of dungeons refers to the generation of the topology, ge-ometry and gameplay-related objects of this type of levels. A typical dungeon gen-eration method consists of three elements: 1. A representational model: an abstract, simplified representation of a dungeon, providing a simple overview of the final dungeon structure. 2. A method for constructing that representational model. 3. A method for creating the actual geometry of a dungeon from its representational model.},

abstract = {Modern computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users, but also in promoting learning. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games, games that have non-entertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter, the techniques employed are very different. Can AIED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques, or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS), a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling, pedagogical agents, and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world, interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties, and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.},

abstract = {Our consumption of online information is mediated by filtering, ranking, and recommendation algorithms that introduce unintentional biases as they attempt to deliver relevant and engaging content. It has been suggested that our reliance on online technologies such as search engines and social media may limit exposure to diverse points of view and make us vulnerable to manipulation by disinformation. In this paper, we mine a massive dataset of Web traffic to quantify two kinds of bias: (i) homogeneity bias, which is the tendency to consume content from a narrow set of information sources, and (ii) popularity bias, which is the selective exposure to content from top sites. Our analysis reveals different bias levels across several widely used Web platforms. Search exposes users to a diverse set of sources, while social media traffic tends to exhibit high popularity and homogeneity bias. When we focus our analysis on traffic to news sites, we find higher levels of popularity bias, with smaller differences across applications. Overall, our results quantify the extent to which our choices of online systems confine us inside "social bubbles."},

Meta-knowledge divides into problem solving methods, quality knowledge, fix knowledge, social knowledge and processing activities. There are five main ways in which these seven knowledge types are processed: acquire, operationalize, fault, fix and preserve. We review systems that contribute to these 7 * 5 = 35 types of knowledge maintenance to make the following conclusions. First, open issues with the current maintenance research are identified. These include (a) areas that are not being addressed by any researcher; (b) the recursive maintenance problem; and (c) drawbacks with rapid acquire systems and the operationalization KM assumption. Secondly, a process is described for commissioning a new maintenance tool. Thirdly, a general common principle for maintenance (search-space reflection) is isolated.},

abstract = {Natural language place descriptions in everyday communication provide a rich source of spatial knowledge about places. An important step to utilize such knowledge in information systems is geo-referencing all the places referred to in these descriptions. Current techniques for geo-referencing places from text documents are using place name recognition and disambiguation; however, place descriptions often contain place references that are not known by gazetteers, or that are expressed in other, more flexible ways. Hence, the approach for geo-referencing presented in this paper starts from a place graph that contains the place references as well as spatial relationships extracted from place descriptions. Spatial relationships are used to constrain the locations of places and allow the later best-matching process for geo-referencing. The novel geo-referencing process results in higher precision and recall compared to state-of-art toponym resolution approaches on several tested place description datasets.},

abstract = {"This work develops and tests the hypothesis that similarity of meaning derives from substitution regularities in the linguistic environment, represented topographically in the brain. We develop a general mathematical theory of semantic space models and use this to motivate a set of new methods for high-dimensional space construction. We then develop a low-dimensional topographic map model of the lexicon from statistical considerations and apply both models to a range of semantic priming experiments. We show that both high and low-dimensional models capture a wide range of previously unmodelled semantic relations. We also model the effects of association, semantic relatedness and their interaction, and offer a new theory of associative relations. We then demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the models also replicate graded and mediated priming effects. Mediated priming is of theoretical importance to memory models because its existence has been taken as evidence for spreading activation and against compound cue models. We show how a semantic space account representing only substitutability relations can account for mediated priming without making any specific architectural assumptions."},

abstract = {This paper considers how to achieve new creative advances in the design of programming languages. It is based on the analysis of a single application domain, the practice of Live Coding in a new area of musical performance known as " Laptop " music. Analysis of live coding as a context for programming allows us to escape the implicit assumptions of the commercial office environment in which so much end-user programming has been studied. The programming environments of the future, with increasing deployment of ubiquitous computing technologies, will be unlike offices in many ways. We can prepare for this future by studying extreme varieties of programming today. Live coding is thus an ideal research opportunity for psychology of programming},

abstract = {What makes us conscious? Many theories that attempt to answer this question have appeared recently in the context of widespread interest about consciousness in the cognitive neurosciences. Most of these proposals are formulated in terms of the information processing conducted by the brain. In this overview, we survey and contrast these models. We first delineate several notions of consciousness, addressing what it is that the various models are attempting to explain. Next, we describe a conceptual landscape that addresses how the theories attempt to explain consciousness. We then situate each of several representative models in this landscape and indicate which aspect of consciousness they try to explain. We conclude that the search for the neural correlates of consciousness should be usefully complemented by a search for the computational correlates of consciousness.},

Results of this analysis reveal methods by which designers push and pull players through levels. We discuss an analysis of these patterns in terms of three level affordance configurations, combat, environmental resistance, and mixed goals in 21 different games using one walkthrough play session per game. By looking at the variety of games, we can further explore the level similarities and differences between games},

Drug Metabolismand Pharmacokinetics Quick Guide is intended for broad readership for those working or interested in drug dis- covery fromvarious disciplines such as medicinal chemistry, phar- macology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, bioanalysis, clinical sciences, biochemistry, pharmaceutics and toxicology. It provides, for the first time, a completely integrated look at multiple aspects of ADME sciences (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) in a summary format that is clear, concise, and self- explanatory. We have minimized the amount of prior knowledge required for the reader by providing the basics of each concept. This reference book is meant to be used day to day and provides many useful tables (used for data interpretation), figures and fac- toids. The factoids are intended to be short and relevant to the topic discussed that would allow another dimension to the discussions.},

abstract = {What does it feel like when one's meaning making is impoverished and threatens to break down? The aim of this study is to show how meaning making is achieved in the context of one's life and how this achievement is often a struggle for the individual. The study reports data from semi-structured interviews with a female participant, which was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). This paper examines how cultural discourses and conventions are experienced and given meaning by the individual. First, the analysis demonstrates how dominant discourses are used to explain anger and aggression. These include hormones, alcohol, and the influence of past relationships on present action. Second, it examines how the participant's meaning making is often ambiguous and confused, and how she variously accepts and challenges available meanings. Finally, the analysis demonstrates how meaning making can break down and the consequences of this for the individual's sense of self.},

As relationships are increasingly formed by spatially dis- tributed partners, supporting social presence has become more important. It is proposed that due to it's inherent intimacy that haptic, specifically ther- mal, stimuli could provide greater levels of social presence. This project begins by analysing the existing literature; specifically discussing communication, the concept of social presence and awareness. A thermal device is designed and constructed to investigate the theory that thermal stimuli can help support re- lationships by increasing feelings of social presence. The findings indicate that there was a significant difference between participants that wore the thermal device and those that did not. The project ends with placing these findings with regards to the existing literature before discussing areas of further work},

abstract = {False positives cause many promising detection technologies to be unworkable in practice. Attackers, we show, face this problem too. In deciding who to attack true positives are targets successfully attacked, while false positives are those that are attacked but yield nothing. This allows us to view the attacker's problem as a binary classiﬁcation. The most proﬁtable strategy requires accurately distinguishing viable from non-viable users, and balancing the relative costs of true and false positives. We show that as victim density decreases the fraction of viable users than can be proﬁtably attacked drops dramatically. For example, a 10× reduction in density can produce a 1000× reduction in the number of victims found. At very low victim densities the attacker faces a seemingly intractable Catch-22: unless he can distinguish viable from non-viable users with great accuracy the attacker cannot ﬁnd enough victims to be proﬁtable. However, only by ﬁnding large numbers of victims can he learn how to accurately distinguish the two. Finally, this approach suggests an answer to the question in the title. Far-fetched tales of West African riches strike most as comical. Our analysis suggests that is an advantage to the attacker, not a disadvantage. Since his attack has a low density of victims the Nigerian scammer has an over-riding need to reduce false positives. By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select, and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favor.},

abstract = {Synthesizing research in philosophy and phenomenology, this article offers a sympathetic critique of Vivian Sobchack's view of digital moving images. Focusing on contemporary first- and third-player video games, it examines how digital imagery inscribes bodily dimensions onto a nonindexical world and the different ways in which we inhabit cinematic and electronic space. More specifically, it draws upon the writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to build a phenomenological model of bodies in digital imagery and argues that video gaming is a fully embodied, sensuous, carnal activity.},

abstract = {Users of computer systems create and store valuable personal in- formation in files, email folders, and bookmark collections. For decades, the main principle of interacting with files, emails, and bookmarks has remained unchanged: hierarchical directory trees with standard (Windows Explorer style) browsers. Users often have problems both in classifying new items and maintaining a classification hierarchy as such. With files, emails, and bookmarks, users often end up maintaining three parallel classi- fication hierarchies, one in each tool. Over the past thirty years, a number of alternative personal information management (PIM) tools have emerged, but the typical user is still faced with hierarchical directory structures. This position paper addresses some of the reasons why modern PIM tools are not widespread and proposes a set of eight require- ments for future PIM tools.},

To help programmers find bugs as soon as they are introduced, we sketch a plugin for an integrated development environment that provides live feedback about behavioral changes to Java programs by continuously generating tests, running the tests on the current and previous versions of the program, and comparing the results. Such a tool would allow programmers to better understand how their changes affect the behavior of their programs. As a proof of concept, we developed a prototype that found a bug that remained undetected by pair programmers working on JHotDraw in a previous study. Had the programmers performed this change with our plugin, they would have been notified about the bug as soon as they introduced it. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Okasaki1996,
abstract = {When a C programmer needs an efficient data structure for a particular prob- lem, he or she can often simply look one up in any of a number of good text- books or handbooks. Unfortunately, programmers in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have this luxury. Although some data struc- tures designed for imperative languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on as- signments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in functional languages. To address this imbalance, we describe several techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient catena- tion. In addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in amortized functional data structures. Traditional methods of amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not just the most recent, are available for further processing. This property is known as persistence, and is taken for granted in functional languages. On the surface, persistence and amortization appear to be incompatible, butwe showhow lazy evaluation can be used to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are efficient even when used persistently. Turning this relationship between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of amortization also provides the first practical techniques for analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs. Finally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming language de- signers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial examples using polymorphic recursion and higher-order, recursive modules.},

abstract = {The social and organisational aspects of agency have led to a good amount of theoretical work in terms of formal models and theories. However, the conception and engineering of proper organisational infrastructures embodying such models and theories are still an open issue. The introduction of normative concerns with requirements of openness and adaptation stresses this issue. The corresponding mechanisms for the current infrastructures appear to be not appropriate for managing distributed and open normative organisations. There is still the need of proper abstractions and tools to facilitate application agents taking part in the monitoring of the organisation on one hand, and in the adaptation and definition of the organisation in which they are situated on the other hand. In this paper we present and discuss ORA4MAS (Organisational Artifacts for Multi-Agent Systems), a proposed approach aiming at these issues. Based on the Agents and Artifacts meta-model ( A{\&}A ), it introduces organisational artifacts as first class entities to instrument the organisation for supporting agents activities within it.},

abstract = {A long-standing shortcoming of statically typed functional languages is that type checking does not rule out pattern-matching failures (run-time match exceptions). Refinement types distinguish different values of datatypes; if a program annotated with refinements passes type checking, pattern-matching failures become impossible. Unfortunately, refinement is a monolithic property of a type, exacerbating the difficulty of adding refinement types to nontrivial programs. Gradual typing has explored how to incrementally move between static typing and dynamic typing. We develop a type system of gradual sums that combines refinement with imprecision. Then, we develop a bidirectional version of the type system, which rules out excessive imprecision, and give a type-directed translation to a target language with explicit casts. We prove that the static sublanguage cannot have match failures, that a well-typed program remains well-typed if its type annotations are made less precise, and that making annotations less precise causes target programs to fail later. Several of these results correspond to criteria for gradual typing given by Siek et al. (2015).},

abstract = {Norms have been promoted as a coordination mechanism for controlling agent behaviours in open MAS. Thus, agent platforms must provide normative support, allowing both norm-aware and non-norm-aware agents to take part in MAS that are controlled by norms. In this paper, the most relevant proposals on the definition of norm enforcement mechanisms are analyzed. These proposals present several drawbacks that make them unsuitable for open MAS. In response to these problems, this paper describes a new Norm-Enforcing Architecture aimed at controlling norms in open MAS. Specifically, this architecture supports the creation and deletion of norms on-line as well as the dynamic activation and expiration of instances. Finally, it can dynamically adapt to different scale MAS. The efficiency of this architecture has been experimentally evaluated and the results are shown in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {What is new about how teenagers communicate through services such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram? Does social media affect the quality of teens' lives? In this eye-opening book, youth culture and technology expert danah boyd uncovers some of the major myths regarding teens' use of social media. She explores tropes about identity, privacy, safety, danger and bullying. Ultimately, boyd argues that society fails young people when paternalism and protectionism hinder teenagers' ability to become informed, thoughtful and engaged citizens through their online interactions. Yet despite an environment of rampant fear-mongering, boyd finds that teens often find ways to engage and to develop a sense of identity. boyd's conclusions are essential reading not only for parents, teachers and others who work with teens, but also for anyone interested in the impact of emerging technologies on society, culture and commerce in years to come. Offering insights gleaned from more than a decade of original fieldwork interviewing teenagers across the United States, boyd concludes reassuringly that the kids are all right. At the same time, she acknowledges that coming to terms with life in a networked era is not easy or obvious. In a technologically mediated world, life is bound to be complicated.},

abstract = {The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a second-order recurrent neural network architecture that excels at storing sequential short-term memories and retrieving them many time-steps later. LSTM's original training algorithm provides the important properties of spatial and temporal locality, which are missing from other training approaches, at the cost of limiting its applicability to a small set of network architectures. Here we introduce the Generalized Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM-g) training algorithm, which provides LSTM-like locality while being applicable without modification to a much wider range of second-order network architectures. With LSTM-g, all units have an identical set of operating instructions for both activation and learning, subject only to the configuration of their local environment in the network; this is in contrast to the original LSTM training algorithm, where each type of unit has its own activation and training instructions. When applied to LSTM architectures with peephole connections, LSTM-g takes advantage of an additional source of back-propagated error which can enable better performance than the original algorithm. Enabled by the broad architectural applicability of LSTM-g, we demonstrate that training recurrent networks engineered for specific tasks can produce better results than single-layer networks. We conclude that LSTM-g has the potential to both improve the performance and broaden the applicability of spatially and temporally local gradient-based training algorithms for recurrent neural networks. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Individuals often judge others based on third-party gossip, rather than their own experience, despite the fact that gossip is error-prone. Rather than judging others on their merits, even when such knowledge is free, we judge based on the opinions of third parties. Here we seek to understand this observation in the context of the evolution of cooperation. If individuals are being judged on noisy social reputations rather than on merit, then agents might exploit this, eroding the sustainability of cooperation. We employ a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Donation game, which has been used to simulate the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity. First, we validate the proposition that adding homophily (the propensity to interact with others of similar beliefs) into a society increases the sustainability of cooperation. However, this creates an evolutionary conflict between the accurate signalling of ingroup status versus the veridical report of the behaviour of other agents. We find that conditions exist where signalling ingroup status outweighs honesty as the best method to ultimately spread cooperation.},

This paper presents a reflective framework for characterizing source languages and domains.

abstract = {One of the key steps in creating quality interactive drama is the ability to create quality interactive characters (or believable agents). Two important aspects of such characters will be that they appear emotional and that they can engage in social interactions. My basic approach to these problems has been to use a broad agent architecture and minimal amounts of modeling of other agent in the environment. This approach is based on an understanding of the artistic nature of the problem. To enable agent-builders (artists) to create emotional agents, I provide a general framework for building emotional agents, default emotion-processing rules, and discussion about how to create quality, emotional characters. My framework gets a lot of its power from being part of a broad agent architecture. The concept is simple: the agent will be emotionally richer if there are more things to have emotions about and more ways to express them. This reliance on breadth has also meant that I have been able to create simple emotion models that rely on perception and motivation instead of deep modeling of other agents and complex cognitive processing. To enable agent builders to create social behaviors for believable agents, I have designed a methodology that provides heuristics for social behaviors and suggests how to model other agents in the environment. I propose an approach to modeling other agents that calls for limiting the amount of modeling of other agents to that which is sufficient to create the desired behavior. Using this technique, I have been able to build robust social behaviors that use surprisingly little representation. I have used this methodology to build a number of social behaviors, like negotiation and making friends. I have built three simulations containing seven agents to drive and test this work. I have also conducted user studies to demonstrate that these agents appear to be emotional and can engage in non-trivial social interactions while also being good characters with distinct personalities.},

abstract = {Many online human activities leave digital traces that are recorded in natural-language format. The exploitation of this unprecedented resource under a computational frame- work can bring a phase transition in our understanding of human social behavior and shape the future of social media systems. This thesis describes a computational ap- proach to an intriguing aspect of conversational behavior, linguistic style coordination: conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles; a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance. We develop a probabilistic framework that can model and quantify this phenomenon and apply it to four different conversational settings: Twitter conversations, discussions betweenWikipedia editors, oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court and movie script dialogs. We are able to examine linguistic style coordination in large scale settings for the first time, and by doing so, to reveal important properties that were never observed in previous studies, which were conducted mainly in small and controlled environments. The resulting new understanding of conversational behavior bears practical impor- tance in the task of uncovering key properties of social relations. We present an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power re- lationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power — including a more “static” form of power based on status differences, and a more “situational” form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Finally, our computational framework can be employed to gain insight into the causal mechanism behind coordination behavior. It was previously hypothesized in the psycho-linguistic literature that coordination has arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status. But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to be- come a reflex? We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imag- ined characters do). Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus. We thereby provide evidence that lan- guage coordination is so implanted within our conception of conversational behavior that, even if such coordination is socially motivated, it is exhibited even when the per- son generating the language in question is not receiving any of the presumed social advantages.},

@article{Joerges1999,
abstract = {In social studies of technology, as in many other scientific disciplines, highly persuasive similes are at work: pious stories, seemingly reaped from research, suggesting certain general theoretical insights. Variously adapted, they are handed down: in the process, they acquire almost doctrinal unassailability. One such parable, which has been retold in technology and urban studies for a long time, is the story of Robert Moses' low bridges, preventing the poor and the black of New York from gaining access to Long Island resorts and beaches. The story turns out to be counterfactual, but even if a small myth is disenchanted, it serves a purpose: to resituate positions in the old debate about the control of social processes via buildings and other technical artefacts - or, more generally, about material form and social content.},

It starts with defining three grand goals of PCG, namely multi-level multicontent PCG, PCG-based game design and generating complete games. The way these goals are defined, they are not feasible with current technology. Therefore we identify nine challenges for PCG research. Work towards meeting these challenges is likely to take us closer to realising the three grand goals. In order to help researchers get started, we also identify five actionable steps, which PCG researchers could get started working on immediately.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, comparative cognitive research has focused on the pinnacles of mental evolution, asking all-or-nothing questions such as which animals (if any) possess a theory of mind, culture, linguistic abilities, future planning, and so on. Research programs adopting this top-down perspective have often pitted one taxon against another, resulting in sharp dividing lines. Insight into the underlying mechanisms has lagged behind. A dramatic change in focus now seems to be under way, however, with increased appreciation that the basic building blocks of cognition might be shared across a wide range of species. We argue that this bottom-up perspective, which focuses on the constituent capacities underlying larger cognitive phenomena, is more in line with both neuroscience and evolutionary biology.},

We present recommendations for incorporating support for each of these areas into point-of-care clinical information systems that provide access to shared patient records. Finally, we discuss general design approaches for incorporating this type of support, including the need for workers to maintain awareness of the activities of others, and the need to integrate communication with the presentation of the health record.},

abstract = {Creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can react robustly to unforeseen player behaviour or novel game content is difficult and time-consuming. This hinders the design of believable characters, and the inclusion of NPCs in games that rely heavily on procedural content generation. We have previously addressed this challenge by means of empowerment, a model of intrinsic motivation, and demonstrated how a coupled empowerment maximisation (CEM) policy can yield generic, companion-like behaviour. In this paper, we extend the CEM framework with a minimisation policy to give rise to adversarial behaviour. We conduct a qualitative, exploratory study in a dungeon-crawler game, demonstrating that CEM can exploit the affordances of different content facets in adaptive adversarial behaviour without modifications to the policy. Changes to the level design, underlying mechanics and our character's actions do not threaten our NPC's robustness, but yield new and surprising ways to be mean.},

abstract = {“Toy worlds” involving actions, such as the blocks world and the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle, are often used by researchers in the areas of common- sense reasoning and planning to illustrate and test their ideas. We would like to create a database of general- purpose knowledge about actions that encodes com- mon features of many action domains of this kind, in the same way as abstract algebra and topology repre- sent common features of specific number systems. This paper is a report on the first stage of this project—the design of an action description language in which this database will be written. The new language is an ex- tension of the action language C+. Its main distinctive feature is the possibility of referring to other action descriptions in the definition of a new action domain.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Background: Histological analysis of the cochlea is required to understand the physiological and pathological processes in the inner ear. In the past, many embedding techniques have been tested in the cochlea to find an optimal protocol that gives both good morphological and immunohistochemical results. Resins provide high quality cochlear morphology with reduced immunogenicity due to the higher polymerization temperature. New method: We used Technovit 9100 New {\textregistered} , a low temperature embedding system based on methyl methacrylate, on adult guinea pig and mouse cochleae to evaluate preservation of the morphology and maintenance of the antigenicity. Results: Conventional toluidine blue staining, as well as immunohistochemical staining with a set of commonly used antibodies, showed highly preserved morphology and immunogenicity of decalcified adult guinea pig and mouse cochleae. Comparison with existing method(s): We demonstrate both, well-preserved morphology and preservation of antigenicity, superior to other embedding techniques. Conclusions: Our results showed that the Technovit 9100 New {\textregistered} embedding system provided highly preserved morphology and immunogenicity with our protocol in adult guinea pig and mouse cochleae.},

Collective intelligence emerges from local interactions among a large number of individuals, none of whom acts as a leader or central controller.

abstract = {Many contemporary games are team-based and there is a growing interest in, and need for, advances in team-mate AI for games. However, although there have been surveys of agent AI in games, to date there has been no survey of work on team-mate AI. Furthermore, the concept of "team-mate AI" is not currently well delineated to distinguish between work on independently-acting agents that happen to be on the same side from work on agents the coordinate their behaviors and decision-making in terms of their teammates behaviors, intentions, and the like. Also, it is important to distinguish between game AI that is used as an optimization technique from real-time game AI, so this paper proposes a definition for real-time team-mate AI (highlighted with examples by game genre), reviews work to date to implement real-time team-mate AI for games in terms of a number of AI research areas (e.g., coordinated action, prediction, learning), and concludes with a brief discussion of significant issues about the state of the art.},

abstract = {Organizations' pursuit of increased workplace collaboration has led managers to transform traditional office spaces into 'open', transparency-enhancing architectures with fewer walls, doors and other spatial boundaries, yet there is scant direct empirical research on how human interaction patterns change as a result of these architectural changes. In two intervention-based field studies of corporate headquarters transitioning to more open office spaces, we empirically examined-using digital data from advanced wearable devices and from electronic communication servers-the effect of open office architectures on employees' face-to-face, email and instant messaging (IM) interaction patterns. Contrary to common belief, the volume of face-to-face interaction decreased significantly (approx. 70{\%}) in both cases, with an associated increase in electronic interaction. In short, rather than prompting increasingly vibrant face-to-face collaboration, open architecture appeared to trigger a natural human response to socially withdraw from officemates and interact instead over email and IM. This is the first study to empirically measure both face-to-face and electronic interaction before and after the adoption of open office architecture. The results inform our understanding of the impact on human behaviour of workspaces that trend towards fewer spatial boundaries.This article is part of the theme issue 'Interdisciplinary approaches for uncovering the impacts of architecture on collective behaviour'.},

abstract = {The relationship between game content and gameplay remains underexplored. High level debate about the relative narrativity of games remains common, but there is a gap in the understanding about the particularities of how diegetic objects relates to the business of managing player experience and behaviour at the heart of gameplay.$\backslash$nThe first half of this thesis proposes a new model for understanding gameplay as a network of affordance relationships which define supported actions. The theoretical focus upon supported actions rather than object characteristics enables a better understanding of the framework of gameplay created by a complex system of interrelated objects. In particular, it illustrates how the essential ludic structure of first-person games can be described in very simple terms, thus defining a discontinuity between complexity of experience and simplicity of structure. It is proposed that story is a primary means of managing this discontinuity to provide an immersive and seamless experience.$\backslash$nTraditional models of narrative and interactive narrative are discussed to illustrate the problems of attempting to apply them directly to gameplay, and this is summarised in a discussion of the narratology/ludology debate. Instead, a new conceptualisation of narrative, drawn from the use of narrative as a model and metaphor in psychology, and based on schema theory is offered. It is argued that this new, game-specific conceptualisation – of a network of protonarrative units – maps efficiently and effectively onto the affordance model of gameplay and thus resolves the historical problem.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this paper we propose a use-case-driven iterative design methodology for normative frameworks, also called virtual institutions, which are used to govern open systems. Our computational model represents the normative framework as a logic program under answer set semantics (ASP). By means of an inductive logic programming approach, implemented using ASP, it is possible to synthesise new rules and revise the existing ones. The learning mechanism is guided by the designer who describes the desired properties of the framework through use cases, comprising (i) event traces that capture possible scenarios, and (ii) a state that describes the desired outcome. The learning process then proposes additional rules, or changes to current rules, to satisfy the constraints expressed in the use cases. Thus, the contribution of this paper is a process for the elaboration and revision of a normative framework by means of a semi-automatic and iterative process driven from specifications of (un)desirable behaviour. The process integrates a novel and general methodology for theory revision based on ASP.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Bontrager2017,
abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition systems to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints. MasterPrints are real or synthetic fingerprints that can fortuitously match with a large number of fingerprints thereby undermining the security afforded by fingerprint systems. Previous work by Roy et al. generated synthetic MasterPrints at the feature-level. In this work we generate complete image-level MasterPrints known as DeepMasterPrints, whose attack accuracy is found to be much superior than that of previous methods. The proposed method, referred to as Latent Variable Evolution, is based on training a Generative Adversarial Network on a set of real fingerprint images. Stochastic search in the form of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy is then used to search for latent input variables to the generator network that can maximize the number of impostor matches as assessed by a fingerprint recognizer. Experiments convey the efficacy of the proposed method in generating DeepMasterPrints. The underlying method is likely to have broad applications in fingerprint security as well as fingerprint synthesis.},

abstract = {How can economic incentives aect cultural practices? As a painful custom persisted in historical China, foot-binding targeted girls whose feet were systematically reshaped during early childhood. This paper models foot-binding as a pre-marital investment in the marriage market, investigating its history of emergence, diusion and decadence. In a segregated society where men and women have inheritable status, marriage is en-dogamy and there is no incentive for costly beauty investment. With a gender-biased shock in the elite recruitment system, meritocracy rose and men's quality distribu-tion became more dispersed than women's. In this case, foot-binding was taken up by women as a costly beauty investment to compete for high quality men, and diused from upper class to working class women with the increasing degree of meritocracy. However, since foot-binding impedes heavy labor, the adoption of foot-binding among working class women exhibits regional variation: it is highly prevalent in regions where women specialized in household handicraft which requires low physical mobility, and it is less popular in regions where women specialized in farmland work, e.g. rice cultiva-tion. Finally, foot-binding faded out following the collapse of the gender-biased elite recruitment system, increasing educational opportunities for girls, and the development of modern textile industry that replaced household handicraft production.},

We confront this enhanced rule learning model with experimental data on games with multiple equilibria and separatrix-crossing behavior. Maximum likelihood results do not support aspiration-based experimentation or anticipated reciprocity as significant explanatory factors, but do support a small propensity for non-aspiration-based experimentation by random belief and non-reciprocity-based cooperation.

We use the revolution in transport technology from the invention of steam railways, newly-constructed spatially- disaggregated data for London from 1801-1921, and a quantitative urban model to provide evidence on the role of these commuting flows in supporting such concentrations of economic activity. Steam railways dramatically reduced travel times and permitted the first large-scale separation of workplace and residence. We show that our model is able to account for the observed changes in the organization of economic activity, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In counterfactuals, we find that removing the entire railway network reduces the population and the value of land and buildings in Greater London by 20 percent or more, and brings down commuting into the City of London from more than 370,000 to less than 60,000 workers.},

We introduce an intuitive and exible modeling framework in which a user can create a street network from scratch or modify an existing street network. This is achieved through designing an underlying tensor eld and editing the graph representing the street network. The framework is intuitive because it uses tensor elds to guide the generation of a street network. The framework is exible because it allows the user to combine various global and local modeling operations such as brush strokes, smoothing, constraints, noise and rotation elds. Our results will show street networks and three-dimensional urban geometry of high visual quality.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of architecture and systems en-gineering for autonomous driving system, through a set of complementary perspectives. For practitioners, a short term perspective uses the state of the art to define a three layered functional architecture for autonomous driv-ing, consisting of a vehicle platform, a cognitive driving intelligence, and off-board supervisory and monitoring services. The architecture is placed within a broader context of model based systems engineering (MBSE), for which we define four classes of models: Concept of Operations, Logical Architecture, Application Software Components, and Platform Components. These classes aid an immediate or subsequent MBSE methodology for concrete projects. Also for concrete projects, we propose an implementation setup and tech-nologies that combine simulation and implementation for rapid testing of au-tonomous driving functionality in physical and virtual environments. Future evolution of autonomous driving systems is explored with a long term per-spective looking at stronger concepts of autonomy like machine consciousness and self-awareness. Contrasting these concepts with current engineering prac-tices shows that scaling to more complex systems may require incorporating elements of so-called constructivist architectures. The impact of autonomy on systems engineering is expected to be mainly around testing and verification, while implementations shall continue experiencing an influx of technologies from non-automotive domains.},

abstract = {Reactive agents are an important part of video games and numerous tools have emerged to facilitate the rapid construction of such agents. While the ability of the commonly used reactive techniques to express agent specifications is roughly equivalent, the authorial burden of constructing these specifications varies. In practice, this means that identical agent behavior may be more difficult to create in some architectures than others. In this paper we introduce the notion of representational complexity that relates to the authorial burden of constructing such agents and theoretically compare the representational complexity of finite state machines, behavior trees, and subsumption architectures. Our key finding is that hierarchical subsumption architectures have significantly lower representational complexity as compared to hierarchical finite state machines and behavior trees, which makes subsumption the best choice when developing authoring tools for non-expert users.},

Although the theory is called a 'logic of inexact concepts', we do not endorse belief in some Platonic ideal 'concepts' or logic embodying their essence. Rather we suggest a method for con- structing and studying models of the way we use words; and we use the word 'concept' metaphorically in discussing meaning. 'Exact concepts' are the sort envisaged in pure mathematics, while 'inexact concepts' are rampant in everyday life. This distinction is complicated by the fact that whenever a human being interacts with mathematics, it becomes part of his ordinary experience, and therefore subject to inexactness. Ordinary logic is much used in mathematics, but applications to everyday life have been criticized because our normal language habits seem so different. Various modifications of orthodox logic have been suggested as remedies, particularly omission of the Law of the Excluded Middle.},

@article{Allcott2018,
abstract = {A common objection to "sin taxes"-corrective taxes on goods that are thought to be over-consumed, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary drinks-is that they often fall disproportionately on low-income consumers. This paper studies the interaction between corrective and redistributive motives in a general optimal taxation framework. We show that the implications of regressivity hinge on why consumption decreases with income. If the consumption-income relationship is driven by income effects, then regressivity is optimally offset by targeted transfers or income tax reforms, not by moderating the level of the sin tax. If the relationship is instead driven by between-income preference heterogeneity, the optimal sin tax depends on the demand elasticity: if demand is more elastic, then progressive benefits from reduced over-consumption can make the optimal sin tax larger than if there were no distributional concerns, while if demand is less elastic, the optimal tax is reduced. As an application, we estimate the optimal nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, using Nielsen Homescan data and a specially designed survey measuring nutrition knowledge and self-control. Our empirical estimates of elasticities, preference heterogeneity, incorrect beliefs, and self-control imply that current city-level taxes in Berkeley, San Francisco, and elsewhere are actually lower than the social optimum.},

abstract = {Axiomatic semantics does have some limitations: Side effects are disallowed in expressions; the goto command is difficult to specify; aliasing is not al-lowed; and scope rules are difficult to describe unless we require all identifier names to be unique. Despite these limitations, axiomatic semantics is an attractive technique because of its potential effect on software development: • The development of " bug free " algorithms that have been proved correct. • The automatic generation of program code based on specifications. In proving the correctness of a program, we use an applied predicate (first-order) logic with equality whose individual variables correspond to program variables and whose function symbols include all the operations that occur in program expressions. Therefore we view expressions such as " 2*n+1 " and " x+y{\textgreater}0 " as terms in the predicate logic (mathematical terms) whose values are determined by the current assignment to the individual variables in the logic language. Furthermore, we assume the standard mathematical and logical properties of operations modeled in the logic—for example, 2*3+1 = 7 and 4+1{\textgreater}0 = true. An assertion is a logical formula constructed using the individual variables, individual constants, and function symbols in the applied predicate calcu-lus. When each variable in an assertion is assigned a value (determined by the value of the corresponding program variable), the assertion becomes valid (true) or invalid (false) under a standard interpretation of the constants and functions in the logical language.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective. The automatic anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies assay offered great advantages over traditional methods in terms of improved precision, reliability, technical simplicity, short turnaround time and high-speed throughput. In this study, we evaluated the main technical performance and diagnostic accuracy of the first automatic anti-CCP assay approved in China. Methods. The study comprised 106 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 203 non-RA rheumatic disease controls and 46 healthy persons. Anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor (RF), $\alpha$1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured and compared. The precision, reference intervals for Chinese population and cut-off value for RA diagnosis, as well as the suitable diluent for anti-CCP were assessed. The positive rate and score of anti-CCP were compared with RF and acute-phase reactants, according to the new RA criteria. Results. Within- and between-run imprecision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, were 0.47-1.36{\%} and 1.15-2.63{\%}, respectively. Upper 95{\%} reference limit of anti-CCP in healthy Chinese was 8.8 U/mL. The area under curve of the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) for anti-CCP and RF were 0.882 (95{\%} CI 0.833-0.930) and 0.844 (95{\%} CI 0.792-0.897), respectively. Based on the cut-off value set by ROC, compared to RF, anti-CCP had higher sensitivity (96.8{\%} vs. 78.3{\%}) and specificity (90.9{\%} vs. 70.7{\%}). With 17 U/mL set as the optimal cut-off for anti-CCP, the total positivity of anti-CCP was comparable to that of RF (76.4{\%} vs. 75.5{\%}), but the high-positivity rate of anti-CCP was significantly higher (74.5{\%} vs. 62.3{\%}, p {\textless} 0.005). Conclusions. Our results confirm anti-CCP as a more sensitive and specific marker than RF for the diagnosis of RA. The diagnostic performance of the Elecsys anti-CCP assay makes it a useful adjunct to clinical practice in the Chinese population.},

abstract = {A fully developed nomology for the study of games requires the development of explanatory theoretical constructs associated with validating observational techniques. Drawing from cognition sciences, a framework is proposed based upon the integration of schema theory with attention theory. Cognitive task analysis provides a foundation for preliminary schema descriptions, which can then be elaborated according to more detailed models of cognitive and attentional processes. The resulting theory provides a rich explanatory framework for the cognitive processes underlying game play, as well as detailed hypotheses for the hierarchical structure of pleasures and rewards motivating players. Game engagement is accounted for as a process of schema selection or development, while immersion is explained in terms of schema execution. This framework is being developed not only to explain the substructures of game play, but also to provide schema models that may inform game design processes and provide detailed criteria for the design of patterns of game features for entertainment, pedagogical and therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {The idea of using evolutionary computation to train artifi- cial neural networks, or neuroevolution (NE), for reinforce- ment learning (RL) tasks has now been around for over 20 years. However, as RL tasks become more challenging, the networks required become larger, as do their genomes. But, scaling NE to large nets (i.e. tens of thousands of weights) is infeasible using direct encodings that map genes one-to- one to network components. In this paper, we scale-up our “compressed” network encoding where network weight ma- trices are represented indirectly as a set of Fourier-type co- efficients, to tasks that require very-large networks due to the high-dimensionality of their input space. The approach is demonstrated successfully on two reinforcement learning tasks in which the control networks receive visual input: (1) a vision-based version of the octopus control task requiring networks with over 3 thousand weights, and (2) a version of the TORCS driving game where networks with over 1 mil- lion weights are evolved to drive a car around a track using video images from the driver's perspective.},

@article{Gebser2015,
abstract = {This document provides an introduction to the Answer Set Programming (ASP) tools gringo, clasp, and clingo, developed at the University of Potsdam. The ba- sic idea of ASP is to express a problem in the form of a logic program so that its logical models, called answer sets, provide the solutions to the original problem. The first tool, gringo, is a so-called grounder translating user-provided logic programs (with variables) into equivalent propositional logic programs (without variables). The second tool, clasp, is a so-called solver computing the answer sets of the propositional programs issued by gringo. The third tool, clingo, combines the functionalities of gringo and clasp, and additionally integrates the scripting languages lua and python either through libraries or embedded code. This guide, for one, aims at enabling ASP novices to make use of the aforementioned tools. For another, it provides a reference of the tools' features that ASP adepts might be tempted to exploit. The guide generally refers to gringo and clingo series 4 as well as clasp series 3; full conformity is obtained with gringo 4.5, clingo 4.5 and clasp 3.1. Please make sure that you have corresponding (or later) versions available.},

abstract = {The difference between ‘artistic and literary fields' and universes such as architecture usually recognized as ‘art professions' but which enjoy a far lesser ‘degree of autonomy' than such fields seemingly constitutes an obstacle to the broader application of the notion of a ‘field of cultural production' sought by Bourdieu in his Rules of Art. The author of this paper overcomes this obstacle by employing his notion of the ‘field effect', with the architecture competition serving as the test case. Following Bourdieu, the author replaces the notion of profession with that of the field, for the former is a representation fostered by professional groups themselves. Architecture is a field, but, because architects require clients to construct and realize their works, one unlike the artistic and literary fields, which are markets of symbolic goods where ‘distinterest' reigns and an autonomy unthinkable elsewhere is enjoyed. However, much like artists and unlike any other ‘professionals', architects enter competitions, suggesting that this practice is an analytically relevant indicator of the field effect. After defining several of the elements of Bourdieu's relational conceptual matrix (field, illusio, collusion, doxa and space of possibles) and demonstrating that the Baptistery competition in Florence (1401) conforms to Bourdieu's historical beginning point for the process of ‘autonomization' of artistic production, I examine a number of competitions from 1401 to 1989 (Berlin Jewish Museum) along with the general properties of competitions (structure and organization, publication and exhibition of results, com- petitors' economically irrational behaviour, practices of designers and jurors and the associated universe of beliefs), analysing them as those of an artistic field. It is concluded that when architects enter competitions, architecture, at least provisionally resembles an artistic field, for there is a field effect shown by a high degree autonomy, disinterest and the creation of an upside-down world},

The discrete search uses the discrete transitions of the hybrid system and coarse-grained decompositions of the continuous state spaces or related projections to guide the motion planner during the search for witness trajectories. Experiments presented in this paper, using a hybrid system inspired by robot motion planning and with nonlinear dynamics associated with each of several thousand modes, provide an initial validation of HyDICE and demonstrate its promise as a hybrid-system testing method.

On the basis of these examples we discuss some of the implications of this inter-enactive approach to agency for our understanding of social phenomena in a broader sense, and how the interenactive account provided here has to be taken alongside a theory of largerscale social processes.},

abstract = {Video games are varied, with vastly different visual layouts and interaction styles; however, most games that share a common genre still have many user interface similarities. These similarities suggest that genres can be used as a conceptual framework for examining design issues in video games, and for developing a deeper understanding of how the design process can be specialized for specific types of games. In this paper, we consider how genre relates to one aspect of design---the usability of games, which deals with players' ability to learn, control, and understand a game interface. We report results from a study where we coded usability problems in reviews of 108 commercial video games. The review set included 18 games from each of six major game genres. We statistically analyzed the problems from each genre, and found significant differences between many of the genres. We present usability profiles for each genre based on the problem distributions that we found. The profiles describe both common and infrequent problems in each genre and provide details on how they commonly occur in games. The profiles can be used to specialize usability evaluations by helping designers focus on common problems seen in games from each genre.},

Such an approach aims to raise awareness about issues which learners could help develop and take with them into industry. However, the experience itself affords a deep experiential rhetoric and dialogue with experts that could be an effective pedagogical tool for issues seldom addressed deeply in formal educational settings. This paper describes an account by one such individual, being introduced to game accessibility through participation in the GGJ. As such, it is not intended as a rigorous empirical analysis, but rather a perspective on one way a game jam can be experienced, inviting further research on the topic.},

abstract = {Call graphs depict the static, caller-callee relation between "functions " in a program. With most source/target languages supporting functions as the primitive unit of composition, call graphs naturally form the fundamental control flow representation available to understand/develop software. They are also the substrate on which various inter- procedural analyses are performed and are integral part of program comprehension/testing. Given their universality and usefulness, it is imperative to ask if call graphs exhibit any intrinsic graph theoretic features - across versions, program domains and source languages. This work is an attempt to answer these questions: we present and investigate a set of meaningful graph measures that help us understand call graphs better; we establish how these measures correlate, if any, across different languages and program domains; we also assess the overall, language independent software quality by suitably interpreting these measures.},

abstract = {Field theory is a more or less coherent approach in the social sciences whose essence is the explanation of regularities in individual action by recourse to position vis-{\`{a}}-vis others. Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges "from the inside" as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of "explanation" that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage.},

abstract = {In recent years sensory history has emerged as a research topic of growing interest to historians and has been accompanied by a call to incorporate the senses into our understanding of the past. Under modernity, social direction and control were built into the infrastructure of modern life as specialist institutions emerged and multiplied in the urban landscape; institutions which were designed to discipline, control and shape urban bodies – the prison, the workhouse, the asylum, the reformatory, the children's home and the school. This paper focuses on one of these sites of childhood control: the school. Historians of education and childhood have to date paid little attention to the sensory worlds of schooling and childhood. This study focuses on one sense – hearing. Hearing, sound and aurality have been shown to be deeply implicated in modernity's daily elaboration. The study explores the sounds of modern schooling; the culture of listening in modern schools; the materiality of the modern school “soundscape”; and the influence of architectural acoustics on the culture of listening. In doing so, the study addresses the problems, sources and methodologies involved in writing a history of the hearing school.},

For instance, avatars in dating were made to look more attractive while avatars in gaming were made to look more intellectual. Yet, predominantly, these emphasized avatar attributes drew on participants' self-image, and thus avatars were perceived by their owners as highly similar to themselves. The implications of these results are discussed against current frameworks of online identity and behavior. Most importantly, we use our results to extract design recommendations for improving avatar-driven applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Biasi2018,
abstract = {In this study, 308 small business executives were interviewed and asked to identify the single most important thing they had learned about managing the use of information technology (IT) in their firms. The most common response was staying current/keeping up with changing IT. The training/education of end users, the ability to get information quickly, and accurate data were also given as things the executives had learned. The small business executives interviewed were from a variety of industries including the computer industry, the health care industry, engineering, consulting, manufacturing, insurance, accounting, and law. Ninety-two percent of the executives had acquired new hardware and 89.9{\%} had acquired new software for their firms since their firms had first started using computers. In approximately 90{\%} of the firms, the number of users of computers had increased and the majority of the new users were classified as both managerial and clerical. Again, approximately 90{\%} of the firms had increased the number of functions for which computers were used within their firms with applications in accounting having the greatest increase.},

abstract = {Objective: Effective collaboration between machines and clinicians requires flexible data structures to represent medical processes and clinical practice guidelines. Such a data structure could enable effective turn-taking between human and automated components of a complex treatment, accurate on-line monitoring of clinical treatments (for example to detect medical errors), or automated treatment systems (such as future medical robots) whose overall treatment plan is understandable and auditable by human experts. Materials and Methods: Behavior trees (BTs) emerged from video game development as a graphical language for modeling intelligent agent behavior. BTs have several properties which are attractive for modeling medical procedures including human-readability, authoring tools, and composability. Results: This paper will illustrate construction of BTs for exemplary medical procedures and clinical protocols. Discussion and Conclusion: Behavior Trees thus form a useful, and human authorable/readable bridge between clinical practice guidelines and AI systems.},

abstract = {This article suggests that a changing sensibility to spatial experience is a characteristic of moder- nity. It makes three assumptions: that modernity finds spatial manipulation thrilling, that spatial experience has a history that relates to the history of perception, and that the study of a society's entertainments can offer insights into its underlying shifts and disturbances. It draws on a range of theories on the role of the corporeal in perception to speculate as to how an audience might have experienced three popular entertainments from the early 20th century. All three shifted the bound- aries of the body, not only in the apparent bodies of the performers but also, the author suggests, in ways that resonated within the bodies of their audiences. The author suggests that such internal resonances, engaging the senses imaginatively and viscerally, contribute to the perceptual vocabu- lary of modernity and often form part of the practice and experience of today's spatial arts.},

@article{Pitt2015,
abstract = {Many open networks, distributed computing systems, and infrastructure management systems face a common problem: how to distribute a collectivised set of resources amongst a set of autonomous agents of heterogenous provenance. One approach is for the agents themselves to self-organise the allocation of resources with respect to a set of agreed conventional rules; but given an allocation scheme which maps resources to those agents and a set of rules for determining that allocation scheme, some natural questions arise-Is this allocation fair? Is the allocation method effective? Is it efficient? Are the decision makers accountable? In this paper, we argue that some answers to these questions can be found in the formal characterisation of different aspects of 'justice' and that these different aspects need a principled operationalisation as policies for system management. We present a formal model and some experimental results, concluding that the different aspects are all inter-connected and that what is required is a comprehensive research programme in computational justice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to clarify what kind of normativity$\backslash$ncharacterizes a convention. First, we argue that conventions have$\backslash$nnormative consequences because they always involve a form of trust and$\backslash$nreliance. We contend that it is by reference to a moral principle$\backslash$nimpinging on these aspects (i.e. the principle of Reliability) that$\backslash$ninterpersonal obligations and rights originate from conventional$\backslash$nregularities. Second, we argue that the system of mutual expectations$\backslash$npresupposed by conventions is a source of agreements. Agreements$\backslash$nstemming from conventions are ``tacit{\{}''{\}} in the sense that they are$\backslash$nimplicated by what agents do (or forbear from doing) and without that$\backslash$nany communication between them is necessary. To justify this conclusion,$\backslash$nwe assume that: (1) there is a salient interpretation, in some contexts,$\backslash$nof everyone's silence as confirmatory of the others' expectations (an$\backslash$nepistemic assumption), and (2) the participating agents share a value of$\backslash$nnot being motivated by hostile attitudes (a motivational assumption). By$\backslash$nclarifying the relation between conventions and agreements, the peculiar$\backslash$nnormativity of conventions is analyzed.},

We propose a setup for multiple users with see-through head-mounted displays, allowing dedicated stereoscopic views and individualized interaction for each participant. Thishardware arrangement does not hinder social communication, which is essential for playing games. To maintain a high quality game experience we use facesnapping for fast and precise direct object manipulation. We derive semantic actions from snap events to pre-defined regions in the virtual gaming space. Combined with the game regions, we introduce a layering concept allowing individual views onto the common data structure. This combination creates a powerful automatic privacy mechanism, which makes security management dispensable at runtime. We demonstrate our system with a board-game Mah-Jongg, that relies heavily on social communication andthe need of private space.},

abstract = {Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of interacting autonomous agents. ABMS promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use electronic laborato- ries to do research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a new way of doing science. Computational advances make possible a growing number of agent-based applications across many fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare, from modeling the growth and decline of ancient civilizations to modeling the complexities of the human immune system, and many more. This tutorial de- scribes the foundations of ABMS, identifies ABMS tool- kits and development methods illustrated through a supply chain example, and provides thoughts on the appropriate contexts for ABMS versus conventional modeling techniques.},

abstract = {Cultural-historical activity theory is a new framework aimed at transcending the dichotomies of micro- and macro-, mental and material, observation and intervention in analysis and redesign of work. The approach distinguishes between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable, object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving collective activity system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed actions and automatic operations are interpreted. Activity systems are driven by communal motives that are often difficult to articulate for individual participants. Activity systems are in constant movement and internally contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, manifested in disturbances and mundane innovations, offer possibilities for expansive developmental transformations. Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of work organization increasingly require negotiated 'knotworking' across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and hybridizing different perspectives and conceptualizations. Findings from a longitudinal intervention study of children's medical care illuminate the theoretical arguments.},

This is in contrast to much of the academic and some of the BDSM (bondage {\&} discipline, dominant {\&} submission, and sadomasochism) lifestyle literature, which denies the likelihood of these relationships. This dissertation explores the lives and relationships of 33 individuals (consisting of 17 heterosexual couples) who defined themselves as active participants in the BDSM lifestyle. Each couple has been in a committed relationship and has practiced sadomasochistic and/or dominant and submissive behaviors as a regular part of their relationship. The relationships are examined in general, how they met and selected each other, the power dynamics within the relationship, and the nature of sexual/SM bargaining within and outside of a BDSM context.},

The recent trend in graphics hardware has been to replace fixed functionality with programmability in areas that have grown exceedingly complex (e.g., vertex processing and fragment processing). The OpenGL Shading Language has been designed to allow application programmers to express the processing that occurs at those programmable points of the OpenGL pipeline. Independently compilable units that are written in this language are called shaders.A program is a set of shaders that are compiled and linked together. The aim of this document is to thoroughly specify the programming language. The OpenGL entry points that are used to manipulate and communicate with programs and shaders are defined separately from this language specification. The OpenGL Shading Language is based on ANSI C and many of the features have been retained except when they conflict with performance or ease of implementation. C has been extended with vector and matrix types (with hardware based qualifiers) to make it more concise for the typical operations carried out in 3D graphics. Some mechanisms from C++ have also been borrowed, such as overloading functions based on argument types, and ability to declare variables where they are first needed instead of at the beginning of blocks.},

Jason is easily customisable and is suitable for the implementation of reactive planning systems according to the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture. Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason provides a brief introduction to multi-agent systems and the BDI agent architecture on which AgentSpeak is based. The authors explain Jason's AgentSpeak variant and provide a comprehensive, practical guide to using Jason to program multi-agent systems. Some of the examples include diagrams generated using an agent-oriented software engineering methodology particularly suited for implementation using BDI-based programming languages. The authors also give guidance on good programming style with AgentSpeak Programming Multi-Agent Systems in AgentSpeak using Jason. Describes and explains in detail the AgentSpeak extension interpreted by Jason and shows how to create multi-agent systems using the Jason platform. Reinforces learning with examples, problems, and illustrations. Includes two case studies which demonstrate the use of Jason in practice},

abstract = {This series is intended to further the creation of the science of agent-based social systems, a field that is establishing itself as a transdisciplinary and cross-cultural science. The series will cover a broad spectrum of sciences, such as social systems theory, sociology, business administration, management information science, organization science, computational mathematical organization theory, economics, evolutionary economics, international political science, jurisprudence, policy science, socioinformation studies, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, complex adaptive systems theory, philosophy of science, and other related disciplines. The series will provide a systematic study of the various new cross-cultural arenas of the human sciences. Such an approach has been successfully tried several times in the history of the modern sciences of humanities and systems and has helped to create such important conceptual frameworks and theories as cybernetics, synergetics, general systems theory, cognitive science, and complex adaptive systems. We want to create a conceptual framework and design theory for socioeconomic systems of the twenty-first century in a cross-cultural and transdisciplinary context. For this purpose we plan to take an agent-based approach. Developed over the last decade, agent-based modeling is a new trend within the social sciences and is a child of the modern sciences of humanities and systems. In this series the term "agent- based" is used across a broad spectrum that includes not only the classical usage of the normative and rational agent but also an interpretive and subjective agent. We seek the antinomy of the macro and micro, subjective and rational, functional and structural, bottom-up and top-down, global and local, and structure and agency within the social sciences. Agent-based modeling includes both sides of these opposites. "Agent" is our grounding for modeling; simulation, theory, and real-world grounding are also required.},

Bombing increased the military and political activities of the communist insurgency, weakened local governance, and reduced noncommunist civic engagement. The study also exploits a spatial discontinuity across neighboring military regions that pursued different counterinsurgency strategies. A strategy emphasizing overwhelming firepower plausibly increased insurgent attacks and worsened attitudes toward the U.S. and South Vietnamese government, relative to a more hearts-and-minds-oriented approach.},

abstract = {Networked multiplayer games must support a much wider variety of interactions than single-player games because networked games involve communication and coordination between players. This means that designers must consider additional usability issues that relate to group play – but there are currently no usability engineering methods that are specifically oriented towards the needs of multiplayer games. To address this problem, we developed a new set of usability heuristics, called Networked Game Heuristics (NGH), which can be used in the design and evaluation of networked multiplayer games. The new heuristics were identified by analyzing problem reports from 382 reviews of networked PC games, covering six main genres. We aggregated problem reports into ten problem categories (covering issues from session management to cheating to training for novice players) and developed heuristics that describe how these usability problems can be avoided. We tested the new heuristics by having evaluators use them and an existing set to assess the usability of two networked games. Evaluators found more usability problems with NGH, and stated that the new heuristics were better for evaluating multiplayer game usability. Our research is the first to present networked game heuristics that are derived from real problem reports, and the first to evaluate the heuristics' effectiveness in a realistic usability test.},

UbiqGames are designed to be played outside of formal class time and over several days, alongside more traditional instruction in the topics covered in the games. Teachers can use class time to facilitate thoughtful reflection on game strategies and data generated through gameplay. In the UbiqGame Weatherlings, players collect virtual creature cards and "battle" other players in arenas based on real cities, which feature the cities' meteorological data from the recent past. Success in the game requires players to consider climate conditions and do short-term forecasting from this real weather data. In this pilot study, 20 Singaporean 10 and 11 year-olds played Weatherlings using mobile devices over four days, playing primarily outside formal class time. Survey and interview data, combined with server logs, demonstrate positive outcomes for students including strong appeal and high engagement, increased interest in weather, and self-reported improvement in weather prediction skills. Outcomes suggest opportunities for additional research around UbiqGames to probe this new model for game-centered learning.},

The experiment varied the level of anthropomorphism of the image of interactants: high anthropomorphism, low anthropomorphism, or no image. Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases telepresence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those inter-acting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

Using the abstraction of the social game, Comme il Faut creates experiences where specific dramatic interactions between characters arise from play. This paper describes the process of authoring for Comme il Faut. Specifically, we will describe the authoring and design considerations for Comme il Faut's inaugural game, The Prom. We discuss how we extracted and encoded an exaggerated social logic from pre-existing media experiences to create its intended story space, developed an idiosyncratic local culture for its story world, defined a set of character histories and personalities to be revealed through play, and authored the specific lines of dialogue and motivating social situations that give the audience experience of The Prom its particular character. Together, these produce an experience with much greater fictional specificity than in open-ended simulation games and many more options for what happens (and how things happen) than in traditional game stories.},

The present study set out to explore the attitudes, experiences, and feelings of online gamers. The study entailed 71 interviews with online gamers (52 males, 19 females) from 11 different countries. Six main themes emerged from the analyses of the interview transcripts: (a) online gaming and integration into day-to-day lives; (b) online gaming, excessive play, and problems; (c) addiction; (d) psychosocial impact of online gaming; (e) online gaming, dissociation, and time loss; and (f) online gaming and the alleviation of negative feelings and mood states.

Range Semigroup Queries In the range minimum query problem, we wanted to preprocess an array so that we could quickly find the minimum element in that range. Imagine that instead of computing the minimum of the value in the range, we instead want to compute A[i] ★ A[i+1] ★ {\ldots} ★ A[j] for some associative op-eration ★. If we know nothing about ★ other than the fact that it's associative, how would we go about solving this problem efficiently? Turns out there are some very clever solutions whose run-times involve the magical Ackermann inverse function.},

abstract = {The $\pi$-calculus is not a closed theory, but rather a theory dependent upon some theory of names. Taking an operational view, one may think of the $\pi$-calculus as a procedure that when handed a theory of names provides a theory of processes that communicate over those names. This openness of the theory has been exploited in $\pi$-calculus implementations, where ancillary mechanisms provide a means of interpreting of names, e.g. as tcp/ip ports. But, foundationally, one might ask if there is a closed theory of processes, i.e. one in which the theory of names arises from and is wholly determined by the theory of processes. Here we present such a theory in the form of an asynchronous message-passing calculus built on a notion of quoting. Names are quoted processes, and as such represent the code of a process, a reification of the syntactic structure of the process as an object for process manipulation. Name- passing in this setting becomes a way of passing the code of a process as a message. In the presence of a dequote operation, turning the code of a process into a running instance, this machinery yields higher-order characteristics without the introduction of process variables. As is standard with higher-order calculi, replication and/or recursion is no longer required as a primitive operation. Somewhat more interestingly, the introduction of a process constructor to dynamically convert a process into its code is essential to obtain computational completeness, and simultaneously supplants the function of the $\nu$ operator. In fact, one may give a compositional encoding of the $\nu$ operator into a calculus featuring dynamic quote as well as dequote. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Several requirements are important-including automation of the execution, maintainability of the translation patterns, and, most importantly, reliability concerning the correctness of the translation. Triple graph grammars (TGGs) have shown to be an intuitive, well-defined technique for model translation. In this paper, we leverage TGGs for industry scale software translations. The approach is implemented using the Eclipse-based graph transformation tool Henshin and has been successfully applied in a large industrial project with the satellite operator SES on the translation of satellite control procedures. We evaluate the approach regarding requirements from the project and performance on a complete set of procedures of one satellite. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Gor is one of the most successful role-play themes in the Virtual World of Second Life (SL). In this theme, player-characters act out a barbaric world of sexual slavery that is based on the novels of John Norman. Norman's narrative comes alive in privately owned 3D simulations (SIMs) that depict settlements in Roman, Viking, or tribal style. This paper gives insight into the construction of Gorean role-play, and positions it within the discourse on role-play in Virtual Worlds. The role-play was studied by undertaking an ethnographic participant-observation. Moreover, the rules of the city of Veroda (a pseudonym) are analysed in detail. The analysis shows that Veroda's rules aim at immersion in the role-play experience and are concerned with the power structure of the SIM, as well as with the personal power relationships of its members. In conclusion, Gorean SIM communities are closed or semi-closed social groups that act as real communities “living” in a particular shared online place. Whereas within gaming worlds the play occurs under the rules of game-design, Gorean role-play groups in Second Life construct their own social rules and play. In doing so, they create and maintain a vibrant community life.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical framework for performance analysis of Behavior Trees (BTs). BTs are a recent alternative to Finite State Machines (FSMs), for doing modular task switching in robot control architectures. By encoding the switching logic in a tree structure, instead of distributing it in the states of a FSM, modularity and reusability are improved. In this paper, we compute performance measures, such as success/failure probabilities and execution times, for plans encoded and executed by BTs. To do this, we first introduce Stochastic Behavior Trees (SBT), where we assume that the probabilistic performance measures of the basic action controllers are given. We then show how Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) can be used to aggregate these measures from one level of the tree to the next. The recursive structure of the tree then enables us to step by step propagate such estimates from the leaves (basic action controllers) to the root (complete task execution). Finally, we verify our analytical results using massive Monte Carlo simulations, and provide an illustrative example of the results for a complex robotic task.},

abstract = {Prom Week is a social-simulation videogame driven by the artificial intelligence engine Comme il Faut (CiF). In each level of the game, the player selects social in- teractions between characters in an effort to achieve so- cially oriented goals. These social interactions are en- acted with hand-authored natural-language dialogue ex- changes, called instantiations, which also serve to ren- der the underlying social considerations propelling the narrative at hand. While CiF's merit is in its capacity to richly model a social space, constraints rooted in au- thorial burden hinder Prom Week's ability to fully ren- der CiF's rich social representations. What is needed is more instantiations, specifically instantiations that can render uncommon or complex game states with greater fidelity. We propose a technique to procedu- rally generate new, felicitous instantiations by recom- bination of dialogue segments from existing instan- tiations that are annotated, using the story-encoding tool SCHEHERAZADE, for their transmissions about the story world and their various dependencies.},

This coupling can impose drawbacks such as arbitrary limitations to the aspect language. LARA is a DSL for source-to-source transformations inspired by AOP concepts, and has been designed to be independent of the target language. In this paper we propose techniques to overcome some of the challenges presented by a language-independent approach to source code transformations, and present and discuss possible solutions and their impact. Additionally, we present some of the benefits and opportunities of this approach. We present an evaluation of our approach, show that we can significantly reduce the effort to develop weavers for new target languages and that the proposed techniques contribute to more concise LARA aspects and safer semantics.},

abstract = {Natural "green barriers" help protect this Florida coastline and infrastructure from severe storms and floods. Coastal Effects 8 Key Message 1 Coastal Economies and Property Are Already at Risk America's trillion-dollar coastal property market and public infrastructure are threatened by the ongoing increase in the frequency, depth, and extent of tidal flooding due to sea level rise, with cascading impacts to the larger economy. Higher storm surges due to sea level rise and the increased probability of heavy precipitation events exacerbate the risk. Under a higher scenario (RCP8.5), many coastal communities will be transformed by the latter part of this century, and even under lower scenarios (RCP4.5 or RCP2.6), many individuals and communities will suffer financial impacts as chronic high tide flooding leads to higher costs and lower property values. Actions to plan for and adapt to more frequent, widespread, and severe coastal flooding would decrease direct losses and cascading economic impacts. Key Message 2 Coastal Environments Are Already at Risk Fisheries, tourism, human health, and public safety depend on healthy coastal ecosystems that are being transformed, degraded, or lost due in part to climate change impacts, particularly sea level rise and higher numbers of extreme weather events. Restoring and conserving coastal ecosystems and adopting natural and nature-based infrastructure solutions can enhance community and ecosystem resilience to climate change, help to ensure their health and vitality, and decrease both direct and indirect impacts of climate change.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose an application-independent model for the defi- nition of artificial institutions that can be used to define open multi-agent systems. Such a model of institutional reality makes us able also to define an objective and external semantics of a commitment-based Agent Communication Language (ACL). In particular we propose to regard an ACL as a set of conventions to act on a frag- ment of institutional reality, defined in the context of an artificial institution. Another contribution of the work presented in this paper is an operational definition of norms, a crucial component of artificial institutions. In fact in open systems interacting agents might not conform to the specifications. We regard norms as event-driven rules that when are fired by events happening in the system create or cancel a set of commit- ments. An interesting aspect of our proposal is that both the definition of the ACL and the definition of norms are based on the same notion of commitment. There- fore an agent capable of reasoning on commitments can reason on the semantics of communicative acts and on the system of norms.},

abstract = {In this paper an argument is presented, suggesting that the concept of identity articulated by Erikson and reflected in ordinary pretheoretical understanding includes, as a central feature, a special experience of self, namely, the experience of a unified psychological "essence," from which superficial characteristics of the person are differentiated. However, as is shown through a close analysis of various identity measures, this subjective experiential aspect is typically neglected in identity research, including the many studies that were guided by the identity status paradigm. A new approach is then presented, aimed at recapturing the subjective meaning of identity, by viewing identity as a modality of the self as subject and as characterized by specific experiences of agency, unity, otherness, and individuality. In an effort to empirically ground this approach, a typology of identity experience, derived from Loevinger′s ego development stages, is described. Several studies are then reviewed, that confirm the viability of this typology and illustrate the advantages of studying identity from the perspective of the self as subject.},

abstract = {Normative multi-agent systems offer the ability to integrate social and individual factors to provide increased levels of fidelity with respect to modelling social phenomena, such as cooperation, coordination, group decision making, and organization, in both human and artificial agent systems. An important open research issue refers to group norms, that is, norms that govern groups of agents. Depending on the interpretation, group norms may be intended to affect the group as a whole, each member of a group, or some members of the group. Moreover, upholding group norms may require coordination among the members of the group. We have identified three sets of agents affected by group norms, namely, (i) the addressees of the norm, (ii) those that will act on it, and (iii) those that are responsible for ensuring norm compliance. We present a formalism to represent these, connecting it to a minimalist agent organisation model. We use our formalism to develop a reasoning mechanism that enables agents to identify their position with respect to a group norm to further support agent autonomy and coordination when deciding on possible courses of action.},

abstract = {E-markets and negotiation protocols are two types of application domains that can be viewed as open computational societies. Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and limited trust. The risk that members of such societies will not conform to specifications imposes the need for a framework that will facilitate the designers to determine to what extent it is desirable to deploy their agents in such societies. We address this need by presenting a formal framework for specifying, animating, and ultimately reasoning about and verifying the properties of open computational systems. We view computational systems from an external perspective, aiming to account for the institutional and social aspects of these systems. We identify the key concepts and illustrate how they are used by formalising an example employing the contract net protocol. The framework and associated logical inferences have been implemented as a software platform that provides automated animation of the global states of an open system (society) during its execution. Simulations have demonstrated that the implementation of the framework establishes a foundation for a rich, formal representation of open computational societies.},

abstract = {Sadomasochistic sex is arguably one of the least understood and most demonised forms of consensual sexuality. How able are we to offer ethical therapy to kinky clients when there is so little awareness of the kink experience? There are a lot of kinky people out there. An American study reported '14 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women have had{\ldots} personal experience with sadomasochism', 1 and further studies reveal a much higher incidence of BDSM (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) fantasy. Many of us are confident in our kinky sexuality and celebrate our exciting sex lives, but some of us feel shame, guilt or confusion around our desires. Yet we struggle to find a counsellor or therapist with whom we can feel confident and comfortable. As kink-identified therapists are rare, what we need is someone who will not judge us or be 'freaked out' if we disclose our kinky identities or practices. Sexual sadism and masochism have been conceptualised as deviant, labelled as pathological and are currently listed in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases) as paraphilias. 'Like homosexuality some 20 years ago, sadomasochistic sex is considered alongside rape and child sexual abuse as individual sexual pathology in need of explanation, treatment and cure.' 2 Yet, encouragingly, recent research has turned to the BDSM community in an attempt to understand the meanings it holds for those who incorporate BDSM practices into their sex lives or experience BDSM as integral to their sexuality. As counsellors and therapists we need to be reflective of our own personal values and beliefs around sexuality and how they are informed by our cultural, political or religious heritage. We need to be aware of how our therapeutic models approach the issue of sexuality and be prepared to question those who pathologise BDSM sexual expression. The key to working ethically with this diverse community is through understanding the world of kink and the meanings held by BDSM practitioners.},

@article{Nakata1995,
abstract = {Recent production system applications have been experiencing exceedingly difficult software maintenance problems. This is because the control of rule firings has been buried in the production rules themselves. To cope with this problem, we propose a meta-level control architecture for production systems, where procedural programming languages, such as Lisp and C, are employed to explicitly describe the control plans of production systems. The key idea of the architecture is to view production systems as a collection of independent rule processes, each of which monitors the global database and performs actions when its conditions are satisfied by the database. Procedural Control Macros (PCMs), which are based on Hoare's CSP, are then introduced into procedural programming languages to establish communication with the collection of rule processes. Although the PCMs are simple and easy to implement, the readability and maintainability of production system applications are greatly enhanced. Together with the original facilities of procedural languages, the PCMs enable users to efficiently specify the control plans for production systems. Furthermore, since control information is gathered into control plans, production rules can be declarative and thereby application-independent. This new feature makes it possible to develop large-scale shared rule bases. Experiments of redescribing 370 rules have been performed based on the proposed meta-level control architecture. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the readability and maintainability of those rules without any significant representation (file volumes) and runtime (processing time) overheads.},

abstract = {As explained by Axelrod in his seminal work An Evolutionary Approach to Norms, punishment is a key mechanism to achieve the necessary social control and to impose social norms in a self-regulated society. In this paper, we distinguish between two enforcing mechanisms. i.e. punishment and sanction, focusing on the specificways in which they favor the emergence and maintenance of cooperation. The key research question is to find more stable and cheaper mechanisms for norm compliance in hybrid social environments (populated by humans and computational agents). To achieve this task, we have developed a normative agent able to punish and sanction defectors and to dynamically choose the right amount of punishment and sanction to impose on them (Dynamic Adaptation Heuristic). The results obtained through agent-based simulation show us that sanction is more effective and less costly than punishment in the achievement and maintenance of cooperation and it makes the population more resilient to sudden changes than if it were enforced only by mere punishment.},

abstract = {The Kleene star operator is an important pattern construct for representing a pattern that repeats multiple times. Due to its simplicity and usefulness, it is imported into various pattern-matching systems other than regular expressions. For example, Mathematica has a similar pattern construct called the repeated pattern. However, they have the following limitations: (i) We cannot change the pattern repeated depending on the current repeat count, and (ii) we cannot apply them to arbitrary data structures such as trees and graphs other than lists. This paper proposes the loop patterns that overcome these limitations. This paper presents numerous working examples and formal semantics of the loop patterns. The examples in this paper are coded in the Egison programming language, which features the customizable non-linear pattern-matching facility for non-free data types.},

abstract = {Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. We have now examined most of the basic topics related to agent-based modeling. We have addressed the following questions about the field of ABM: What is an ABM? Why, how, and when should you use ABM? How do you build ABMs, and how do you conduct (and analyze) experiments with ABM? We have covered the basics of what you need to know in order to start working with ABM. In this final chapter, we will discuss some advanced topics in ABM that you may go on to pursue. We will also survey select applications in which ABM has been productively used. Many readers will not need to read through this chapter from start to finish, but might want to use it more as a reference, or browse the subheadings and read the topics most relevant to you. Advanced Topics in ABM Having laid the groundwork for basic knowledge of ABM, the modeling process, and complex systems, we want now to discuss many related topics that we simply do not have time or space to address in detail in this textbook. In the following pages, we will briefly survey some of the major topics we did not address and provide references where you can learn more about them. We will discuss a range of topics, including some advanced methods of designing ABMs, calibrating ABMs, communicating with ABMs that involve other types of agents (e.g., humans and robots); combining ABM with other modeling techniques; and using advanced data sources and data analysis tools in combination with ABM. We will start with some advanced methods for designing ABMs. In this text, we stressed the ABM design principle of starting simple and building toward your question. This basic principle is very useful and it can be employed in combination with other design 8},

Therefore, we approach this problem in two steps: first, reviewing the most popular BT literature exposing the aforementioned issues; second, describing our unified BT framework along with equivalence notions between BTs and Controlled Hybrid Dynamical Systems (CHDSs). This paper improves on the existing state of the art as it describes BTs in a more accurate and compact way, while providing insight about their actual representation capabilities. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework to real systems scheduling open-loop actions in a grasping mission that involves a NAO robot and our BT library.},

abstract = {Games are shaped by the tools we use to make them and our ability to model the concepts they address. Vast improvements in computer graphics technology, processing power, storage capacity, and physics simulations have driven game design for the past forty years, leading to beautiful, spacious, detailed, and highly immersive worlds supporting games that are, for the most part, fundamentally about movement, collision, and other physics-based concepts. Designers use increasingly complex tools that support the creation of these worlds. The games industry is undoubtedly thriving on these technologies, but what comes next? The tools that game designers use today are highly complex--too complex for a growing population of novice designers, and offering little support for reasoning about gameplay--and there are entire genres of games that cannot be made using the tools available to us now. This dissertation presents the use of procedural content generation to create {\textless}bold{\textgreater}expressive design tools{\textless}/bold{\textgreater}: content generators that are accessible to designers, supporting the creation of new kinds of design tools and enabling the exploration of a new genre of game involving the deep integration of procedural content generation into game mechanics and aesthetics. The first of these tools is Tanagra, the first ever AI-assisted level design tool that supports a designer creating levels for 2D platforming games. Tanagra guarantees that levels created in the tool are playable, and provides the designer with the ability to modify generated levels and directly control level pacing. The second tool is Launchpad, which supports a designer controlling both component and pacing features of generated levels; its companion game {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Endless Web{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} uses the generator to create an infinite world for players to explore and alter through their choices. {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Endless Web{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is one of a handful of games in a new genre enabled by content generation: PCG-based games. Finally, this dissertation presents a novel method for understanding, visualizing, and comparing a generator's expressive range, thus allowing designers to understand the implications of decisions they will make during the design process.},

The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments.

The new field of hypercomputation studies models of computation that can compute more than the Turing machine and addresses their implications. In this report, I survey much of the work that has been done on hypercomputation, explaining how such non-classical models fit into the classical theory of computation and comparing their relative powers. I also examine the physical requirements for such machines to be constructible and the kinds of hypercomputation that may be possible within the universe. Finally, I show how the possibility of hypercomputation weakens the impact of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and Chaitin's discovery of 'randomness' within arithmetic.},

Our starting point is a new corpus of requests annotated for politeness, which we use to evaluate aspects of politeness theory and to uncover new interactions between politeness markers and context. These findings guide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and syntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such as indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier achieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our framework to study the relationship between politeness and social power, showing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a similar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange, where users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of politeness variation by gender and community.},

Using the framework of evolutionary game theory, second we fuse these endogenously derived individual socio-economic attribute changes with Prisoner's Dilemma in an agent based framework to model the interactive political-cultural effects of heterogeneous, spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We explore the model's behavioral dynamics via simulation methods to identify paths and pitfalls towards economic development, cultural plasticity, and social change behavior. Our preliminary results suggest strong nonlinear path dependence in three areas: development processes, evolutionary intra-societal transactions and development trajectories, with significant implications for anticipating and managing positive development outcomes.},

abstract = {Cooperation and competition are important subjects in social and economical studies. Similar dynamics exists in large-scale online communities. In this paper, we present a quantitative study on the cooperation and competi- tion dynamics of an online gaming community. During a period of four months, we collected a total of over one million data points in an open game room with an online gaming site (www.ourgame.com.cn) for a popular card game “up- grade”. The “upgrade” game room provided us an excellent environment to ob- serve how cooperative and competitive relationships are formed in an online community. Through the statistical analysis, we obtain the probability for play- ers with different score tags forming cooperative and competitive relationships with each other. Our analysis shows that all players exhibit preferential bias in their partner selection process, but shows little bias in their selection of com- petitors. Further, the cooperation bias is the strongest in both the low score and high score ends of the player population. We also discuss the effect of such preferential bias on the population distributions in the game community. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale quantitative study on the cooperation dy- namics in online gaming community. The online game community environment offers us a great proxy to study the same dynamics that is difficult to investigate in the real world social environment. The large, statistically significant amount of data enables us to develop and test many hypotheses.},

A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.},

abstract = {Does face recognition involve face-specific cognitive and neural processes ('domain specificity') or do faces only seem special because people have had more experience of individuating them than they have of individuating members of other homogeneous object categories ('the expertise hypothesis')? Here, we summarize new data that test these hypotheses by assessing whether classic face-selective effects - holistic processing, recognition impairments in prosopagnosia and fusiform face area activation - remain face selective in comparison with objects of expertise. We argue that evidence strongly supports domain specificity rather than the expertise hypothesis. We conclude that the crucial social function of face recognition does not reflect merely a general practice phenomenon and that it might be supported by evolved mechanisms (visual or nonvisual) and/or a sensitive period in infancy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The design of sheet metal components is perhaps one of the more challenging concurrent activities for design and manufacturing engineers. To aid this design process, a method is developed to encapsulate the constraints of sheet metal that make designing such components a tedious and iterative procedure. This project involves the implementation and testing of a geometric representation scheme for building feasible sheet metal components through the use of 17 grammar rules that capture manufacturing operations like cutting and bending. The implemented system has benefits both as a user interaction tool and as the basis for a computational design synthesis approach for designing sheet metal components. An example of a constructed sheet metal component is shown along with the method for invoking the sheet metal grammar to create this component.},

abstract = {Gentrification involves large-scale neighborhood change whereby new residents and improved amenities increase property values. In this paper, we study whether and how much public safety improvements are capitalized by the housing market after an exogenous shock to the gentrification process. We use variation induced by the sudden end of rent control in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1995 to examine within-Cambridge variation in reported crime across neighborhoods with different rent-control levels, abstracting from the prevailing city-wide decline in criminal activity. Using detailed location-specific incident-level criminal activity data assembled from Cambridge Police Department archives for the years 1992 through 2005, we find robust evidence that rent decontrol caused overall crime to fall by 16 percent—approximately 1,200 reported crimes annually—with the majority of the effect accruing through reduced property crime. By applying external estimates of criminal victimization's economic costs, we calculate that the crime reduction due to rent deregulation generated approximately {\$}10 million (in 2008 dollars) of annual direct benefit to potential victims. Capitalizing this benefit into property values, this crime reduction accounts for 15 percent of the contemporaneous growth in the Cambridge residential property values that is attributable to rent decontrol. Our findings establish that reductions in crime are an important part of gentrification and generate substantial economic value. They also show that standard cost-of-crime estimates are within the bounds imposed by the aggregate price appreciation due to rent decontrol.},

@book{Canadians2010,
abstract = {How Canadians Communicate: Contexts of Popular Culture is the third in a series of books meant both to chronicle and to contribute to our understanding of the Canadian experience. The first volume focused on the challenges that Canadian media and communication industries faced as they entered the first years of the twenty-first century. The second volume dealt with the impact of globalization on Canadian media and culture and how Canadians both adapt to and resist these influences. This third volume describes not only the sites of popular culture—social media, video games, art, mem- ory institutions, cinema, sports, and so on—but the seeds and sparks that create these explosions of expression and creativity. But these experiences intersect with gender, social class, language, region, ethnic heritage, and age, among other factors and conditions to determine how we use and give meaning to pop- ular culture. The book raises critical issues about our uses of myths and stereo- types, how we define beauty, how we deal with our darkest visions, the role of violence in society, how culture is used both to enforce and to push the bound- aries of convention and social control and how we express our many identities. The hope is that Contexts of Popular Culture will both illuminate this complex and multi-textured landscape, and become a catalyst for research and discussion.},

The emerging variant of doing field experiments does not meet the criticisms. It is argued that an adequate new paradigm will be a more radical departure involving, on the creative side, deriving hypotheses from a systems theory of social and cognitive structures that takes into account multiple and bidirectional causality among social variables. On the critical side, its hypotheses testing will be done in multivariate correlational designs with naturally fluctuating variables.

The selected 25 players have been on the top of the ATP rankings for a shorter or longer period in the last 40 years. Some of them have never met on the court. One of the aims of the paper is to provide ranking of the selected players, however, the analysis of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices is also in the focus. The eigenvector method and the logarithmic least squares method were used to calculate weights from incomplete PCMs. In our results the top three players of four decades were Nadal, Federer and Sampras. Some questions have been raised on the properties of incomplete PCMs and remains open for further investigation.},

abstract = {Now that we have had some experience with extending agent-based models and building ABMs on our own, we can take a step back and more comprehensively examine the indi-vidual components of such models. This gives us a chance to reflect on some issues that arise when implementing new ABMs. We begin this chapter by laying out an overview of the components of an ABM; in some cases, this will be a review of features discussed in previous chapters. We will then discuss each of the components in turn. At the end of the chapter, we will discuss how all of these components come together to create a full set of tools for the construction of ABMs. Overview As we have described in chapter 1, the raison d ' {\^{e}} tre of agent-based modeling is the idea that complex systems can be productively modeled and explained by creating agents and environment, describing their behavior through agent rules, and specifying agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. This description of an ABM is itself a simplified picture, a model of agent-based modeling, if you will. The main components of any ABM are agents , environment , and interactions. Agents are the basic ontological units of the model, while the environment is the world in which the agent lives. The distinction between agents and environment can be fluid, as the environment can some-times be modeled as agents. Interactions can occur either between agents or between},

abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for build- ing practical systems. In order to enhance understandabil- ity, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majori- ties to guarantee safety. 1},

abstract = {Dialogue systems are central to role-playing games, adventure games, interactive fictions, and some forms of interactive drama and cinema---but we have little empirical evidence about how, or even whether, the design of dialogue system interfaces shapes gameplay experience. In this paper we present the results of a study directly comparing three different dialogue system interfaces implemented over the complete course of a dramatic, story-focused game. We find that, holding the rest of the game steady, changing the dialogue interface produces significant changes in gameplay experience. Further, these changes shape perceptions of the system well beyond the interface and its operation. The changes are also sometimes resonant with, and sometimes at odds with, conventional wisdom about these interface options in the game design and writing communities. Our study compared three interfaces: a sentence selection interface (which appears to maximize story involvement), an abstract response menu interface (which maximized reasoning about the underlying game structures), and a natural language understanding interface (which maximized a sense of presence and engagement with the overall experience). Our full results provide valuable future guidance for those seeking a dialogue interface that is resonant with their gameplay experience goals.},

@misc{Rentschler,
abstract = {Over the past decade, video games have been commercially substantiated as a mass medium, addressing an increasingly broad audience. With the sudden explosion of mobile platforms and social network games, hundreds of millions of users now play video games. Yet, it seems few industry developers pay heed to the impact video games have on the day-to-day lives of their players, as they continue to design games primarily for economic profit. As both media and technology, however, video games are imbued with ethical, political, and social values expressed through the various components of the games themselves. In this dissertation, I seek to examine how these human values are expressed in video games by focusing on four layers of the video game: rules, fiction, platform, and kinesthetic. By negotiating how each of these layers is expressive of human values, I explain how video games are capable of uniquely communicating ethics and politics through the intricacies of their complex design, including the more commonly analyzed sites of the visual, aural, and narrative, as well as rule sets, code, and input mechanisms. In my case studies on melodrama, proceduralized gender, and gunplay, I also examine some of values communicated by popular industry video games thus far, understanding what values and ideologies these seemingly frivolous media artifacts operate by and communicate in toto.

abstract = {The design of intelligent socio-technical systems calls for careful examination of relevant social and organizational concepts. We present a method for supporting this design process, placing emphasis on different levels of formal characterization, with equal attention to both the analysis of concepts in a formal calculus independent of computational concerns, and the representation of concepts in a machine-processable form, fully cognizant of implementation issues—a step in the method we refer to as principled operationalization. There are many tools (i.e. formal languages) that can be used to support the design method; we define and discuss criteria for evaluating such tools. We believe that, were the method proposed to be adopted, it would enhance the state-of-the-art in the systematic design and engineering of socio-technical systems, respecting the fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of those tasks, in both their theoretical and practical dimensions.},

The study included samples from multiple disciplines, considered different criterion measures, and corrected for statistical artifacts. Data from 1,753 independent samples were included in the meta-analysis, yielding 6,589 correlations for 8 different criteria and 82,659 graduate students. The results indicated that the GRE and UGPA are generalizably valid predictors of graduate grade point average, Ist-year graduate grade point average, comprehensive examination scores, publication citation counts, and faculty ratings. GRE correlations with degree attainment and research productivity were consistently positive; however, some lower 90{\%} credibility intervals included 0. Subject Tests tended to be better predictors than the Verbal, Quantitative, and Analytical tests. Effective selection and training of graduate students is of critical importance for all fields requiring graduate training.

abstract = {This paper investigates the player experience of immersion and its relationship with player involvement in an experimental setting. The paper follows Calleja's [3] premise that immersion, defined as “the player's sensation of inhabiting the virtual environment represented onscreen”, is not a stand-alone experience but the result from a blending of a variety of experiential phenomena afforded by involving gameplay. These experiential phenomena are described in Calleja's [3] player involvement model, developed through qualitative research and identifying six dimensions of involvement in digital games. The aim of our study was to test this player involvement model and its possible conclusion in immersion in a quantitative context. The paper describes the execution of an experimental study in which we manipulated one dimension of player involvement (i.e. narrative involvement), and analyzed how this affects the other dimensions of player involvement on the one hand, and immersion on the other. Our results provide initial support for Calleja's [3] model, showing that the dimensions of player involvement are interrelated, and have a significant and positive effect on a player's sense of immersion.},

abstract = {With an average of more than 900 top-level merges into the Linux kernel per release, many containing hundreds of commits and some containing thousands, maintenance of older versions of the kernel becomes nearly impossible. Various commercial products, such as the Android platform, run older versions of the kernel. Due to security, performance, and changing hardware needs, maintainers must understand what changes (commits) are added to the current version of the kernel since the last time they inspected it in order to make the necessary patches. Current tools provide information about repositories through the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the repository, which is helpful for smaller projects. However, with the scale and number of branches in the kernel the DAG becomes overwhelming very quickly. Furthermore, the DAG contains every ancestor of every commit, while maintainers are more interested in how and when a commit arrives to the official Linux repository. In this paper, we propose the merge-tree, a simplified transformation of the DAG of the Linux git repository that shows the way in which commits are merged into the master branch of Linux. Using the merge-tree, we build Linvis, a tool that is designed to allow users to explore how commits are merged into the Linux kernel.},

However, the use of model transformation languages may present challenges to those who are unfamiliar with a specific transformation language. This paper presents an approach called model transformation by demonstration (MTBD), which allows an end-user to demonstrate the exact transformation desired by actually editing a source model and demonstrating the changes that evolve to a target model. An inference engine built into the un- derlying modeling tool records all editing operations and infers a transformation pattern, which can be reused in other models. The paper motivates the need for the approach and discusses the technical contributions of MTBD. A case study with several sample inferred transformations serves as a concrete example of the benefits of MTBD. Keywords:},

abstract = {In current videogames non-player characters' (NPCs') abilities to be active, dynamic agents are typically constrained to a bare mini- mum. Agents have very local behaviours to deal with actions, which can combine in limited ways with global game mechanics to deal with repeated behaviours. Here we present a systems-AI approach to designing NPCs. The proposed NPC design is capable of dynamic dialog, with context generated from both episodic memory and emo- tional valence towards previous social interactions. The NPCs can be allowed to run independently of users to develop a believable so- cial network of friendships and grudges, with memories supporting such opinions. Additionally, NPCs can spread information in a more realistic manner than the current standard, global mechanisms. This information fomrs a culture, which then serves as the motivation for quests offered to other characters and the user that encounters these societies},

The aim is to provide hands-on solutions for game developers who want to offer interactions with the NPCs in the game that are socially driven rather than functionally motivated and that encourage the player to build and maintain relationships between the character they control and the other game characters. By means of gameplay design patterns (GDPs), i.e. a semi-formal means of describing, sharing and expanding knowledge about game design, a selection of games have been analysed in order to identify existing and hypothetical GDPs for game dialogues. The analysis resulted in a number of GDPs that support, or could support, social interaction among game characters. A selection of the identified patterns has then been modelled using Harel statecharts and implemented in State Chart XML, a candidate to become a W3C standard},

abstract = {Norms and social laws are one of the key mechanisms used to facilitate coordination in multiagent systems. In existing approaches the process of designing useful norms has to either be performed by a human expert, or requires a full enumeration of the state space which is bound to cause tractability problems in non-trivial domains. In this paper we propose a novel automated synthesis procedure for prohibitive norms in planning-based domains that disallow access to a set of predefined undesirable states. Our method performs local search around declarative specifications of states using AI planning methods. Using this approach, norms can be syn- Thcsised in a generalised way over incomplete state specifications to improve the efficiency of the process in many practical cases, while producing concise, generalised, social norms that are applicable to entire sets of system states. Wc present an algorithm that utilises traditional planning techniques to ensure continued accessibility under the prohibitions introduced by norms. An analysis of the computational properties of our algorithm is presented together with a discussion of possible heuristic improvements.

@article{Castelfranchi1998a,
abstract = {In the new AI of the 90s an important stream is artificial social intelligence. In this work basic ontological categories for social action, structure, and mind are introduced. Sociality (social action, social structure) is let emerge from the action and intelligence of individual agents in a common world. Also some aspects of the way-down—how emergent collective phenomena shape the individual mind—are examined. First, interference and dependence are defined, and then different kinds of coordination (reactive versus anticipatory; unilateral versus bilateral; selfish versus collaborative) are characterised. “Weak social action”, based on beliefs about the mind of the other agents, and “strong social action”, based on goals about others' minds and their actions, are distinguished. Special attention is paid to Goal Delegation and Goal Adoption that are considered as the basic ingredients of social commitment and contract, and then of exchange, cooperation, group action, and organisation. Different levels of delegation and then of autonomy of the delegated agent are described; and different levels of goal-adoption are shown to characterise true collaboration. Social goals in the minds of the group members are argued to be the real glue of joint activity, and the notion of social commitment, as different from individual and from collective commitment, is underlined. The necessity for modelling social objective structures and constraints is emphasised and the “shared mind” view of groups and organisations is criticised. The spontaneous and unaware emergence of a dependence structure is explained, as well as its feedback on the participants' minds and behaviours. Critical observations are presented on current confusions such as that between “social” and “collective” action, or between communication and social action. The main claims of the paper are the following: (a) The real foundation of all sociality (cooperation, competition, groups, organisation, etc.) is the individual social action and mind. One cannot reduce or connect action at the collective level to action at the individual level unless one passes through the social character of the individual action, (b) Important levels of coordination and cooperation necessarily require minds and cognitive agents (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.). (c) However, cognition, communication and agreement are not enough for modelling and implementing cooperation: emergent pre-cognitive structures and constraints should be formalised, and emergent forms of cooperation are needed also among planning and deliberative agents, (d) We are going towards a synthetic paradigm in AI and Cognitive Science, reconciling situatedness and plans, reactivity and mental representations, cognition, emergence and self-organisation.},

abstract = {Each summer in Australia, bushfires burn many hectares of forest, causing deaths, injuries, and destroying property. Agent-based simulation is a powerful tool for decision-makers to explore different strategies for managing such crisis, testing them on a simulated population; but valid results require realistic underlying models. It is therefore essential to be able to compare models using different architectures to represent the human behaviour, on ob-jective and subjective criteria. In this paper we describe two simulations of the Australian population's behaviour in bushfires: one with a finite-state machine architecture; one with a BDI architecture. We then compare these two models with respect to a number of criteria.},

abstract = {The notion of Abstract Data Type (ADT) has served as a foundation model for structured and object oriented programming for some thirty years. The current trend in software engineering toward component based systems requires a foundation model as well. The most basic inherent property of an ADT, i.e., that it provides a set of operations, subverts some highly desirable properties in emerging formal models for components that are based on the object oriented paradigm. We introduce the notion of Abstract Behavior Type (ABT) as a higher-level alternative to ADT and propose it as a proper foundation model for both components and their composition. An ABT defines an abstract behavior as a relation among a set of timed-data-streams, without specifying any detail about the operations that may be used to implement such behavior or the data types it may manipulate for its realization. The ABT model supports a much looser coupling than is possible with the ADT's operational interface, and is inherently amenable to exogenous coordination. We propose that both of these are highly desirable, if not essential, properties for models of components and their composition. To demonstrate the utility of the ABT model, we describe Reo: an exogenous coordination language for compositional construction of component connectors based on a calculus of channels. We show the expressive power of Reo, and the applicability of ABT, through a number of examples. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Several of the hurdles in meaningful procedural generation are exacer- bated when it comes to characters, especially when they are at the very center of the stage. Ontogenetic approaches (i.e., that try to mimic the desired result, instead of generating it by simulating natural processes) are usually the best fit for most applications, usually involving altering a base character and/or combining sets of modular parts. This is, however, still a design, art and engineering challenge. This chapter covers procedural character generation, while pointing at character design fundamentals that should be kept in mind when designing these systems. Starting by reviewing state-of-the-art techniques from games that have them as a main feature, it then covers mesh generation, altering existing meshes and scaling bones to generate diverse silhouettes. It also proposes a technique for 3D mesh combi- nation that involves offline tagging of vertices in edges to create seamless joints between modules at runtime. Finally, it covers texture generation and combining texture channels in ways that allow even more varied characters.},

abstract = {Dance choreography is an intense, creative and intuitive process. A choreographer has to finalize appropriate dance steps from amongst millions of possibilities. Though it is not impossible, the choreographer being human cannot explore, analyze and remember all these variations among steps due to large scale of available options. Hence, we propose to simplify the problem of exploring and selecting dance steps from amongst the huge set of all possible variations for an Indian Classical Dance, BharataNatyam (BN). Based on a computational model developed by Jadhav et al. [13], we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) driven automatic system that would provide a list of unexplored novel dance steps to choreographers. We have incorporated certain measures to ensure that the proposed dance steps should be feasible and appropriate. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach to obtain unexplored dance steps using a proposed fitness function for a single beat/count. The details of experimental study performed for the Genetic Algorithm based art to SMart (System Modelled art) system along with the results obtained are also presented in this paper.},

SDO was distinguished from interpersonal dominance, conservatism, and authoritarianism. SDO was negatively correlated with empathy, tolerance, com- munality, and altruism.

@article{Kiselyov2013,
abstract = {We design and implement a library that solves the long-standing problem of combining effects without imposing restrictions on their interactions (such as static ordering). Effects arise from interactions between a client and an effect handler (interpreter); interactions may vary throughout the program and dynamically adapt to exe- cution conditions. Existing code that relies on monad transform- ers may be used with our library with minor changes, gaining effi- ciency over long monad stacks. In addition, our library has greater expressiveness, allowing for practical idioms that are inefficient, cumbersome, or outright impossible with monad transformers. Our alternative to a monad transformer stack is a single monad, for the coroutine-like communication of a client with its handler. Its type reflects possible requests, i.e., possible effects of a com- putation. To support arbitrary effects and their combinations, re- quests are values of an extensible union type, which allows adding and, notably, subtracting summands. Extending and, upon han- dling, shrinking of the union of possible requests is reflected in its type, yielding a type-and-effect system for Haskell. The library is lightweight, generalizing the extensible exception handling to other effects and accurately tracking them in types.},

This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

abstract = {In this article I provide a meso-level account of the interactional-institutional link by revisiting Goffman's analysis of deference and demeanor in light of Bourdieu's discussion of institutional fields, cultural capital, and symbolic power. To acquire deference, one must exhibit the appropriate demeanor towards others, and one must be equipped with the cultural capital that fits the institutional context. Once acquired, deference is a kind of credit that can be deployed as the symbolic power to frame (define) actions, situations, and events in ways that induce compliance and shape the social order. I also consider how these dynamics are gendered in particular contexts. Data from a two-year ethnographic study of "Costen Elementary School" brings the emergent theory to life. The theory helps explain interactions at the school and the efforts of administrators who tried to change the institutional order from autonomy to accountability. By analyzing how deference and symbolic power operate in an institution...},

To accomplish these goals, we recommend that journals adopt common and transparent standards for authorship, outline responsibilities for corresponding authors, adopt the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) (docs.casrai.org/CRediT) methodology for attributing contributions, include this information in article metadata, and require authors to use the ORCID persistent digital identifier (https://orcid.org). Additionally, we recommend that universities and research institutions articulate expectations about author roles and responsibilities to provide a point of common understanding for discussion of authorship across research teams. Furthermore, we propose that funding agencies adopt the ORCID identifier and accept the CRediT taxonomy.

abstract = {Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) are known for their strong narrative structure. Over time, quests have become one of the main mechanics for leading a player through the story. Quests are given to the player in the form of a set of tasks to complete with few, if any, options. The options given to the player instead often revolve around combat-oriented actions requiring the player to engage in combat to progress through the storyline, despite player preference or game story that hints otherwise. We address this issue with the GrailGM, a run-time game master which offers quests and actions to the player based on their history and current world state.},

@book{Crawford,
abstract = {The central premise of this book is that computer games constitute a new and as yet poorly developed art form that holds great promise for both designers and players. This premise may seem laughable or flippant. How could anybody classify the likes of SPACE INVADERS and PAC MAN as art? How can TEMPEST or MISSILE COMMAND compare with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Michelangelo's Pieta, or Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms? Computer games are too trivial, too frivolous to be called art. They are idle recreation at best. So says the skeptic. But we cannot relegate computer games to the cesspit of pop culture solely on the evidence of the current crop of games. The industry is too young and the situation is too dynamic for us to dismiss computer games so easily. We must consider the potential, not the actuality. We must address the fundamental aspects of computer games to achieve a conclusion that will withstand the ravages of time and change. There are many definitions of art, few of which make much sense to the uninitiated. I will present my own pedestrian definition: art is something designed to evoke emotion through fantasy. The artist presents his audience with a set of sensory experiences that stimulates commonly shared fantasies, and so generates emotions. Art is made possible only by the richness of the fantasy world we share. Art is nevertheless difficult, because there are so many practical problems associated with stimulating fantasies deep inside another person's mind. A major problem is getting the attention or participation of the audience. Most art allows very little participation. You sit quietly and listen to music that other people created and perform, or you stroll through a museum and stare at pictures or statues other people made. You sit passively and read a novel, or a poem, or a short story. With all of these art forms, the role of the audience is passive. The artist does all the active work, makes the biggest emotional investment. The audience is expected to absorb quietly the fruits of the artist's exertions. Active participation is severely curtailed. Without participation, attention dwindles and impact crumbles away. This is in no wise a criticism of art or artists. The technologies of art preclude participation. If we had every klutz jump into the orchestra pit, or prance on the opera stage, or slop paint with Picasso, we would have some great parties but no art. it seems the curse of art that artists can say so much in their work and most people will hear so little because they cannot participate in the art. Enter the computer. Conceived long ago, born in war, reared as the servant of business, this now adolescent technology has exploded out of the computer room and invaded shopping centers, pizza parlors, and homes. Popular characterizations of the computer alternate between the old image of the computer as omniscient, cold blooded, giant calculator, and the new image of the computer as purveyor of video thrills and 25 cent fixes. Originally developed as a number cruncher, the computer assumed a new personality when it was given graphics and sound capabilities. These capabilities gave the computer a powerful asset: it could now communicate with the human, not just in the cold and distant language of digits, but in the emotionally immediate and compelling language of images and sounds. With this capability came a new, previously undreamed of possibility: the possibility of using the computer as a medium for emotional communication art. The computer game has emerged as the prime vehicle for this medium. The computer game is an art form because it presents its audience with fantasy experiences that stimulate emotion. Unfortunately, the current generation of microcomputers cannot produce a sensory experience as rich as that produced by, say, a symphony orchestra or a movie. This weakness is more than offset by a fundamental advantage lacking in most other art forms: a game is intrinsically participatory in nature. The artist has here a tool that is more subtly indirect than traditional art. With other art forms, the artist directly creates the experience that the audience will encounter. Since this experience is carefully planned and executed, the audience must somehow be prevented from disturbing it; hence, non participation. With a game, the artist creates not the experience itself but the conditions and rules under which the audience will create its own individualized experience. The demand on the artist is greater, for s/he must plan the experience indirectly, taking into account the probable and possible actions and reactions of the audience. The return is far greater, for participation increases attention and heightens the intensity of the experience. When we passively observe someone else's artistic presentation, we derive some emotional benefit, but when we actively participate in a game, we invest a portion of our own ego into the fantasy world of the game. This more sizable investment of participation yields a commensurately greater return of emotional satisfaction. Indeed, the role of participation is so important that many people derive greater satisfaction from participating in an amateur artistic effort than from observing a professional effort. Hence, games, being intrinsically participatory, present the artist with a fantastic opportunity for reaching people. Until now, games in general and computer games in particular have not been very impressive as art forms. The computer games especially are downright puerile. This is because the technology of computer games has been in the hands of technologists, not artists. These guys (and they are almost all male) can write beautiful operating systems, languages, linking loaders, and other technological wonders, but artistic flair has heretofore been treated as subordinate to technical prowess. Another contributor to the fecklessness of our current computer games is the timidity of the marketplace. These machines are new; the public is unfamiliar with them and the manufacturers are hesitant to press the public too hard too fast. We therefore opt to build inhibited little games pathetically whispering some trivial emotion. Truly intense emotions or situations such as pathos, ecstasy, majesty, rapture, catharsis, or tragedy intimidate use. We hide behind the defense that we are in the entertainment business, not the art business, but that defense only betrays a profound misunderstanding of art. Art can be starchily elitist, but good art can also be a foot stomping blast. Elitism arises from the intellectual content of art; impact springs from its emotional honesty. Fortunately, times are changing. Already, we see a backlash developing against computer games. It expresses itself in many ways: in ordinances against the placement of arcade games in some areas, in statements by educators denouncing the games, and in more vigilant regulation of children's game activities by parents. This backlash is viewed by smaller minded members of the industry with anxiety. More visionary thinkers watch the backlash with eager interest rather than defensiveness. The American people are telling us something here, something very important. It is imporant enough to them that they are willing to compromise their traditional reluctance to interfere with other people's business. While the arguments presented in public debates normally focus on formal issues such as delinquency from school, creation of large groups of rowdy teenagers, and so forth, the concerns expressed privately reflect a distaste for the games, a vague suspicion that the games are a waste of time. You can't fool all of the people all of the time; they are beginning to realize that the world of computer games is as yet a vast wasteland. Computer games are much like candy, comic books, and cartoons. All four activities provide intense or exaggerated experiences. Whether they use sugar, exclamation points, or animated explosions, the goal is the same: to provide extreme experiences. Children appreciate these activities because their novelty value is still strong. Adults, jaded by years of experience with such things, prefer diversions with greater subtlety and depth. We thus have the panoply of culinary achievement, the vast array of literature, and the universe of movies as the adult counterparts to candy, comic books, and cartoons. Yet, we have no adult counterpart to computer games. This deficit is pregnant with possibilities, for it suggests a momentous upheaval in computer game design. This developing revolution has nothing to do with the rapid technological developments of the last few years. While technological improvements will surely continue, we are no longer hampered primarily by the limitations of the hardware. Our primary problem is that we have little theory on which to base our efforts. We don't really know what a game is, or why people play games, or what makes a game great. Real art through computer games is achievable, but it will never be achieved so long as we have no path to understanding. We need to establish our principles of aesthetics, a framework for criticism, and a model for development. New and better hardware will improve our games, but it will not guarantee our artistic success any more than the development of orchestras guaranteed the appearance of Beethoven. We are a long way from a computer game comparable to a Shakespeare play, a Tchaikowsky symphony, or a Van Gogh self portrait. Each of these artists stood on the shoulders of earlier artists who plunged into an unexplored world and mapped out its territories so that later artists could build on their work and achieve greater things. We computer game designers must put our shoulders together so that our successors may stand on top of them. This book is my contribution to that enterprise.},

We predicted World of Warcraft players would create their main character more similar to their ideal self than the players themselves were. Our results support this idea; a sample of players rated their character as having more favorable attributes that were more favorable than their own self-rated attributes. This trend was stronger among those with lower psychological well-being, who rated themselves comparatively lower than they rated their character. Our results suggest that the game world allows players the freedom to create successful virtual selves regardless of the constraints of their actual situation.},

As we interact more and more with computers -- both personal computers and others -- the questions of whether machines can think and what kind of thoughts they can have become ever more pertinent. We can ask whether machines remember, believe, know, intend, like or dislike, want, understand, promise, owe, have rights or duties, or deserve rewards or punishment. Is this an all-or-nothing question, or can we say that some machines do some of these things and not others, or that they do them to some extent?},

@article{Shivers1991,
abstract = {Programswritten in powerful, higher-order languages like Scheme,ML, and CommonLisp should run as fast as their FORTRAN and C counterparts. They should, but they don't. A major reason is the level of optimisation applied to these two classes of languages. Many FORTRAN and C compilers employ an arsenal of sophisticated global optimisations that depend upon data-flow analysis: common-subexpression elimination, loop-invariant detection, induction-variable elimination, and many, many more. Compilers for higher- order languages do not provide these optimisations. Without them, Scheme, LISP and ML compilers are doomed to produce code that runs slower than their FORTRAN and C counterparts. The problem is the lack of an explicit control-flow graph at compile time, somethingwhich traditional data-flow analysis techniques require. In this dissertation, I present a technique for recovering the control-flowgraph of aScheme programat compile time. I give examples of how this information can be used to perform several data-flow analysis optimisations, including copy propagation, induction-variable elimination, useless-variable elimination, and type recovery. The analysis is defined in termsof a non-standard semantic interpretation. The denotational semantics is carefully developed, and several theorems establishing the correctness of the semantics and the implementing algorithms are proven.},

@article{Fornara2008a,
abstract = {Abstract Software agents' ability to interact within different open systems, designed by different groups, presupposes an agreement on an unambiguous definition of a set of concepts, used to describe the context of the interaction and the communication language the agents can use. Agents' interactions ought to allow for reliable expectations on the possible evolution of the system; however, in open systems interacting agents may not conform to predefined specifications. A possible solution is to define interaction environments including a normative component, with suitable rules to regulate the behaviour of agents. To tackle this problem we propose an application-independent metamodel of artificial institutions that can be used to define open multiagent systems. In our view an artificial institution is made up by an ontology that models the social context of the interaction, a set of authorizations to act on the institutional context, a set of linguistic conventions for the performance of institutional actions and a system of norms that are necessary to constrain the agents' actions.},

Protege is a general-purpose tool that allows domain experts to build knowledge-based systems by creating and modifying reusable ontologies and problem-solving methods, and by instantiating ontologies to construct knowledge bases. The SHriMP (Simple Hierarchical Multi-Perspective) visualization technique was designed to enhance how people browse, explore and interact with complex information spaces. Although SHriMP is information independent, its primary use to date has been for visualizing and documenting software programs. The paper describes how we have applied software visualization techniques to more general knowledge domains. It is hoped that the integrated environment (called Jambalaya) will result in an easier to use and more powerful environment to support ontology evolution and knowledge acquisition. An example scenario of how Jambalaya can be applied to knowledge acquisition is provided.},

abstract = {Why do members of the public disagree - sharply and persistently - about facts on which expert scientists largely agree? We designed a study to test a distinctive explanation: the cultural cognition of scientific consensus. The 'cultural cognition of risk' refers to the tendency of individuals to form risk perceptions that are congenial to their values. The study presents both correlational and experimental evidence confirming that cultural cognition shapes individuals' beliefs about the existence of scientific consensus, and the process by which they form such beliefs, relating to climate change, the disposal of nuclear wastes, and the effect of permitting concealed possession of handguns. The implications of this dynamic for science communication and public policy-making are discussed.

abstract = {This chapter addresses the question that most beginning qualitative researchers ask: 'How can I gather good data and then what should I do with them?' Starting out on a qualitative research project is an exciting challenge but can be a daunting venture. You can learn to do good quali­ tative research. Sometimes students and professional social scientists alike believe that an insightful qualitative study only results from the researcher's extraordinary talents. They are wrong. Good qualitative research results fr om hard work and systematic approaches. That means gathering enough data, synthesizing t hem and making analytic sense of them. Grounded theory methods provide a set of strategies fo r conducting rigorous qualitative research. These methods make the strategies of gifted qualitative researchers explicit and available to any diligent novice. Using grounded theory methods expedites your research, enables you to develop a cogent analysis and stimulates your excitement about and enjoyment of doing research. This chapter will help plan your data collection and give you strategies fo r handling your data analysis. In the fo llowing pages, I introduce the grounded theory method and show how a novice can apply its basic procedures. Throughout the dis­ cussion, I illustrate points by drawing upon my recent social psychological study of experiencing chronic illness. To begin, I provide a short discussion of the logic of grounded theory to explain its basic premises and strategies and to locate it within qualitative research more generally. Next, I discuss data collection objectives and strategies to show how to generate useful data. Then I move on to coding qualitative data and describe how creating categories early in the research shapes subsequent data collection. A discussion of memo-writing fo llows because it is the crucial intermediate step between data collection and writing drafts of papers. Finally, I compare the procedures of the grounded theory approach with traditional logico-deductive research design to clarify their differences. The logic of grounded theory Defining grounded theory What are grounded theory methods? They are a logically consistent set of data collection and analytic procedures aimed to develop theory.

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {It is important to develop an understanding of children's engagement and choices in learning experiences outside of school as this has implications for their development and orientations to other learning environments. This mixed-methods study examines relationships between the genres of video games children choose to play and the learning strategies they employ to improve at these games. It also explores students' motivations for playing the games they choose to play. One hundred eighteen fourth- and fifth-grade students participated in this study. Qualitative analyses of student responses resulted in a model for classifying motivation for game choices. Children primarily cite reasons that can be classified as psychological or cognitive reasons for choosing to play certain video games, and are motivated by the challenge and thinking required in the games. Analyses using Chi-square tests of association demonstrated significant relationships between video game genre and learning strategy used for two of the six learning strategies (p {\textless} .05). Children playing action games are more likely to use repetition to learn the game and children playing adventure games are more likely to use their imaginations to take on the role of the character in the game and think the way the character would to make decisions in the game. There were also several gender differences in learning preferences. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study, we closely followed the world's largest single location game jam in order to explore the engagement among participants. The authors joined the organizing group of the Nordic Game Jam 2013, and gained a favorable opportunity to observe the 470 game developers efforts during the 48 hours of non-stop development. The paper presents the results of two surveys conducted just before and after the event as well as observations during the game jam. The main motivational factors among participants were to develop games and to meet new people. We believe that the community building as well as the motivation and engagement due to social aspects and the desire to learn more about game development among participants at such events might have beneficial ripple effects, which are valuable to investigate more closely.},

abstract = {Knowledge about social hierarchies organizes human behavior, yet we understand little about the underlying computations. Here we show that a Bayesian inference scheme, which tracks the power of individuals, better captures behavioral and neural data compared with a reinforcement learning model inspired by rating systems used in games such as chess. We provide evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) selectively mediates the updating of knowledge about one's own hierarchy, as opposed to that of another individual, a process that underpinned successful performance and involved functional interactions with the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, we observed domain-general coding of rank in the amygdala and hippocampus, even when the task did not require it. Our findings reveal the computations underlying a core aspect of social cognition and provide new evidence that self-relevant information may indeed be afforded a unique representational status in the brain.},

abstract = {The typical information worker is interrupted every 12 minutes, and half of the time they are interrupting themselves. However, most of the research on interruption in the area of human-computer interaction has focused on understanding and managing interruptions from external sources. Internal interruptions -- user-initiated switches away from a task prior to its completion -- are not well understood. In this paper we describe a qualitative study of self-interruption on the computer. Using a grounded theory approach, we identify seven categories of self-interruptions in computer-related activities. These categories are derived from direct observations of users, and describe the motivation, potential consequences, and benefits associated with each type of self-interruption observed. Our research extends the understanding of the self-interruption phenomenon, and informs the design of systems to support discretionary task interleaving on the computer.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate-everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments. ?? 1991.},

Researchers investigated central representations of body parts and actions involving these, but neglected the global and unitary character of self-consciousness, the 'I' of experience and behaviour. We ask, what are the minimally sufficient conditions for the appearance of a phenomenal self, that is, the fundamental conscious experience of being someone? What are necessary conditions for self-consciousness in any type of system? We offer conceptual clarifications, discuss recent empirical evidence from neurology and cognitive science and argue that these findings offer a new entry point for the systematic study of global and more fundamental aspects of self-consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

NLP researchers aim to gather knowledge on how human beings understand and use language so that appropriate tools and techniques can be developed to make computer systems understand and manipulate natural languages to perform the desired tasks. Applications of NLP include a number of fields of studies, such as machine translation, natural language text processing and summarization, user interfaces, multilingual and cross language information retrieval (CUR), speech recognition, artificial intelligence and expert systems.},

abstract = {Value alignment is a property of an intelligent agent indicating that it can only pursue goals that are beneficial to humans. Successful value alignment should ensure that an artificial general intelligence cannot intentionally or unintentionally perform behaviors that adversely affect humans. This is problematic in practice since it is difficult to exhaustively enumerated by human programmers. In order for successful value alignment, we argue that values should be learned. In this paper, we hypothesize that an artificial intelligence that can read and understand stories can learn the values tacitly held by the culture from which the stories originate. We describe preliminary work on using stories to generate a value-aligned reward signal for reinforcement learning agents that prevents psychotic-appearing behavior.},

abstract = {Much has been written on change in social norms, but with few exceptions such efforts have failed to synthesize the growing the-oretical literature with the specifics of empirical cases. At-tempting such a synthesis, we develop a theoretical framework for explaining norm emergence and change that builds on Barth's idea of generative models. We identify three mechanisms offered in the contemporary theoretical literature to account for the dy-namic process of norm change: (i) coordination on focal points, (2) competitive selection among contracts, and (3) bargaining. We investigate three examples of norm change among the Galole Orma-common property rights, bridewealth, and clan exog-amy-and show that examination of strategic decision making within the constraints presented by social context can produce adequate accounts of such change. We conclude that the primary mechanism in norm change among the Orma is bargaining and that the most important sources of such change are asymmetries in bargaining power.},

@article{Wand1988,
abstract = {In an important series of papers [8, 9], Brian Smith has discussed the nature of programs that know about their text and the context in which they are executed. He called this kind of knowledge reflection. Smith proposed a programming language, called {\{}3-LISP,{\}} which embodied such self-knowledge in the domain of metacircular interpreters. Every {\{}3-LISP{\}} program is interpreted by a metacircular interpreter, also written in {\{}3-LISP.{\}} This gives rise to a picture of an infinite tower of metacircular interpreters, each being interpreted by the one above it. Such a metaphor poses a serious challenge for conventional modes of understanding of programming languages. In our earlier work on reflection [4], we showed how a useful species of reflection could be modeled without the use of towers. In this paper, we give a semantic account of the reflective tower. This account is self-contained in the sense that it does not em- ploy reflection to explain reflection.},

The contributors are some of the most renowned scholars working on video games today including Henry Jenkins, Jesper Juul, Eric Zimmerman, and Mia Consalvo. While the first volume had a strong focus on early video games, this volume also addresses more contemporary issues such as convergence and MMORPGs.

abstract = {Crack cocaine markets were associated with substantial increases in violence in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. Using cross-city variation in the emergence of these markets, we show that the resulting violence has important long-term implications for understanding current levels of murder rates by age, sex and race. We estimate that the murder rate of young black males doubled soon after crack's entrance into a city, and that these rates were still 70 percent higher 17 years after crack's arrival. We document the role of increased gun possession as a mechanism for this increase. Following previous work, we show that the fraction of suicides by firearms is a good proxy for gun availability and that this variable among young black males follows a similar trajectory to murder rates. Access to guns by young black males explains their elevated murder rates today compared to older cohorts. The long run effects of this increase in violence are large. We attribute nearly eight percent of the murders in 2000 to the long-run effects of the emergence of crack markets. Elevated murder rates for younger black males continue through to today and can explain approximately one tenth of the gap in life expectancy between black and white males.},

In the structure-mapping theory, the interpretation rules are characterized as implicit rules for mapping knowledge about a base domain into a target domain. Two important features of the theory are (a) the rules depend only on syntactic properties of the knowledge representation, and not on the specific content of the domains; and (b) the theoretical framework allows analogies to be distinguished cleanly from literal similarity statements, applications of abstractions, and other kinds of comparisons. Two mapping principles are described: (a) Relations between objects, rather than attributes of objects, are mapped from base to target; and (b) The particular relations mapped are determined by systematicity, as defined by the existence of higher-order relations.},

Game designers craft games (assembled from rule systems and content), but they really seek to manipulate play: the interaction between games and players. When developing new games that are similar to past games, a designer may rely on previous experience with related designs and relatively easy access to players familiar with conventional design choices. When exploratorily venturing into uncharted territory, uncovering games that afford novel modes of play, there is a need for practical and technological interventions that improve a designer's access to feedback from the unfamiliar design scenario. In the interdisciplinary space between game design, design studies, computational creativity, and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), my program of mechanizing exploratory game design aims to amplify human creativity in game design; enable new game designs through deep, play-time design automation; and demonstrate novel tools that respect the concerns of design problems.},

In the amusement industry, convincing sensory illusions and natural interactivity can translate directly into fascination for players and profit for owners. As with most technology-enabled opportunities today, the focus is often on the details: 70mm, simulation, full motion, HDTV, networking, cyberspace, virtual reality and so on. But these are (conceptually) "adjectives." What will the "nouns" be? What will players do with the technology? Where is the true value? Are these entertainments useful for something besides improving hand-eye coordination and encouraging aggressive behavior? LBEs are pure human interfaces. Here, at the beginning of an era of awesomely capable technologies, there is a remarkable opportunity to create new frameworks, scenarios, situations and mythologies. Most schools have taught that collaboration is the equivalent of cheating; but now it is becoming obvious that, although some individuals may win by themselves, more certain wins for more people are likely through collaboration. LBEs can be networked simulations; thus they can help people learn cooperation through play. LBEs can be groupware, and may be uniquely supportive of collaboration.},

abstract = {Four hundred and thirty five stomach mucosal biopsies were taken from 145 consecutive patients (3 from each patient) during investigations for dyspepsia in three hospitals in Western Nigeria.The aim was to determine the best suited rapid screening method to aid fast diagnosis of ulcer/gastritis in this environment, using Gram stain, CLO test kit (urease production test) and culture methods. Eighty-nine (61.4{\%}) biopsies were positive using Gram stain, 61 (42.1{\%}) using CLO test kit and only 28 (19.3{\%}) using culture. Based on the various limitations of CLO test kits and culture methods, Gram stain was adjudged the best suited rapid method.The clinical implication of this finding is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to give a high-level overview 4of the field of artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: (1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; (2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and (3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields.},

Frequently, the implementation of the inference engine embedded in these applications is based on the RETE algorithm. Some applications supervise a flow of events in which time, through the occurrence dates of the events, plays an important role. These applications need to be able to recognize patterns involving events. However the RETE algorithm does not provide support for the expression of time-sensitive patterns. This paper proposes an extension of RETE through the concepts of time-stamped events and temporal constraints between events. This allows applications to write rules that process both facts and events.},

abstract = {Using a novel form of meta-analysis, this research estimates information processing parameter estimates for older adults using the Card, Moran, {\&} Newell (1983) Model Human Processor model and applies these perceptual, motor, and cognitive parameters to mobile phone usability studies across tasks of increasing complexity. Older adult models predicted older adult human performance data extremely well ( R = 0.99), and older adult models produced equivalent goodness-of-fits to previously validated younger adult models for task completion time, suggesting that older adult parameters are valid for modeling purposes. Critical path analyses for mobile phone tasks supported and substantiated human factors findings and were also decomposed to highlight places where errors would likely occur as a function of cognitive workload, hardware or software design (including menu depth/breadth, button size, environmental supports), and user characteristics. Errors were then classified in ways amenable to modeling and error probabilities were extracted from known human performance. These were implemented in a novel GOMS model for error prediction in a more complex task, and analyses revealed no differences between model predictions and human production of error across all types of classified errors and across young and old age. As such, this research validates older adult parameters so that capabilities and limitations may be better understood with regard to existing designs, and so future technologies may be better designed around the needs of older adults. Further, this research decomposes errors into classifications amenable to human performance modeling, and extends a modeling technique to account for error prediction.},

abstract = {Institutional theory and structuration theory both contend that institutions and actions are inextricably linked and that institutionalization is best understood as a dynamic, ongoing process. Institutionalists, however, have pursued an empirical agenda that has largely ignored how institutions are created, altered, and reproduced, in part, because their models of institutionalization as a pro- cess are underdeveloped. Structuration theory, on the other hand, largely remains a process theory of such abstraction that it has generated few empirical studies. This paper discusses the similarities between the two theories, develops an argument for why a fusion of the two would enable institutional theory to significantly advance, develops a model of institutionalization as a structuration process, and proposes methodological guidelines for investigating the process empirically.

abstract = {This paper seeks to offer an alternative approach to the study of prejudice than that based upon the notion of categorization which is currently influential in cognitive social psychology. It is argued that the categorization approach assumes the inevitability of prejudice and ignores the issue of tolerance. The assumptions of the categorization approach are criticized, and it is suggested that, by focusing on categorization as a cognitive process, it has overlooked an opposing process—that of particularization. The result has been a rather mechanical and bureaucratic model of cognition. A less mechanical view is possible if the relations between the two processes of categorization and particularization are considered from a rhetorical perspective, which examines the argumentative nature of thought. For theoretical and empirical reasons, this perspective does not equate prejudiced thinking with rigid categorization; instead a rhetorical approach permits a distinction between prejudice and tolerance on the basis of content, rather than form, and thereby avoids assuming the inevitability of prejudice.},

abstract = {There is currently great interest in the phylogenetic origins of altruistic behaviour within the primate order. Considerable attention has been focused on chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, because they are our closest living relatives and participate in a wide range of collective activities, including hunting and food sharing. Food sharing is of particular importance because it plays a critical role in the human foraging niche, but food sharing among adults is rare in nonhuman primates. Some research suggests that chimpanzees selectively share meat with reciprocating partners and allies, while other work indicates that chimpanzees primarily share to reduce harassment from other group members (tolerated theft). We examined the effects of kinship, relationship quality, reciprocity and the intensity of solicitations on the pattern of food transfers in six captive groups of chimpanzees. We observed events that occurred after the chimpanzees were provisioned with large frozen juice disks. These disks share some properties with prey carcasses: they are a valued, but limited, resource; they take a considerable period of time to consume; they can be monopolized by one individual, but bits can be broken off and transferred to others. Our analyses suggest that food transfers serve multiple functions for chimpanzees. Individuals may use food transfers to enhance the welfare of closely related group members, strengthen social relationships with favoured partners and reduce the costs of persistent solicitations. ?? 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

A display list caching and frustum filling approach manages the generation of buildings and the use of system resources. This approach has been implemented on commodity PC hardware, resulting in interactive frame rates.},

abstract = {Although replication is a central tenet of science, direct replications are rare in psychology. This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect – imagined contact reducing prejudice – showed weak support for replicability. And two effects – flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification – did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.},

abstract = {In Unit Operations, Ian Bogost argues that similar principles underlie both literary theory and computation, proposing a literary-technical theory that can be used to analyze particular videogames. Moreover, this approach can be applied beyond videogames: Bogost suggests that any medium-from videogames to poetry, literature, cinema, or art-can be read as a configurative system of discrete, interlocking units of meaning, and he illustrates this method of analysis with examples from all these fields. The marriage of literary theory and information technology, he argues, will help humanists take technology more seriously and hep technologists better understand software and videogames as cultural artifacts. This approach is especially useful for the comparative analysis of digital and nondigital artifacts and allows scholars from other fields who are interested in studying videogames to avoid the esoteric isolation of "game studies." Pong, Half-Life, and Star Wars Galaxies. Bogost draws on object technology and complex adaptive systems theory for his method of unit analysis, underscoring the configurative aspects of a wide variety of human processes. His extended analysis of freedom in large virtual spaces examines Grand Theft Auto 3, The Legend of Zelda, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, and Joyce's Ulysses. In Unit Operations, Bogost not only offers a new methodology for videogame criticism but argues for the possibility of real collaboration between the humanities and information technology.},

abstract = {A new paradigm has emerged in which both genetic and environmental factors are cited as possible influences on sociopolitical attitudes. Despite the increasing acceptance of this paradigm, several aspects of the approach remain underdeveloped. Specifically, limitations arise from a reliance on a twins-only design, and all previous studies have used self-reports only. There are also questions about the extent to which existing findings generalize cross-culturally. To address those issues, this study examined individual differences in liberalism/conservatism in a German sample that included twins, their parents, and their spouses and incorporated both self- and peer reports. The self-report findings from this extended twin family design were largely consistent with previous research that used that rater perspective, but they provided higher estimates of heritability, shared parental environmental influences, assortative mating, and genotype-environment correlation than the results from peer reports. The implications of these findings for the measurement and understanding of sociopolitical attitudes are explored.},

We proceed to discuss the design requirements for semiotic agents, including those for artificial environments with a rich enough virtual physics to support selected selforganization; semiotic agents as implementing a generalized control relation; and situated communication and shared knowledge within a community of such agents. We conclude with a discussion of the resulting properties of such systems for dynamical incoherence, and finally describe an application to the simulation of the decision structures of Command and Control Organizations.},

@article{Klonick2018,
abstract = {The hybrid field of artificial intelligence (AI) is still an 'open'$\backslash$nintellectual frontier which psychologists, together with computer$\backslash$nscientists, anthropologists, cognitive biologists, linguists, physicists$\backslash$nand philosophers, among others, can explore on a more or less equal$\backslash$nfooting (Adams-Webber, 1993). Their ultimate goal is to design an$\backslash$nabstract machine whose linguistic behaviour is equivalent to that$\backslash$nof humans (e.g. Turing, 1950). That objective presupposes that the$\backslash$nconceptual bases of all of our linguistic behaviour are amenable$\backslash$nto formalization. Others subscribe to the more modest agenda of using$\backslash$ncomputational procedures to model only some aspects of human cognition,$\backslash$nfor example, 'expertise' in chess or medical diagnosis (see Chapter$\backslash$n8, pp. 87-94). Proponents of both approaches have developed simulation$\backslash$nprograms which are models of human cognitive processes in the form$\backslash$nof computer software. Such models are essentially theories. The main$\backslash$nidea is that the linguistic behaviour of the program should closely$\backslash$napproximate that of humans (Simon, 1995). The detailed internal functions$\backslash$nof the model are viewed as a potential theoretical explanation of$\backslash$nthe corresponding human performance when the input-output behaviour$\backslash$nof the computer running the program closely resembles that of humans.$\backslash$nThese computational models can be specified fully in mathematical$\backslash$nterms and are unprecedented in the field of psychology with respect$\backslash$nto their level of precision and internal consistency. George Alexander$\backslash$nKelly's Range Corollary applies to an important problem in the theory$\backslash$nof knowledge which has extensive implications throughout the field$\backslash$nof AI. That is, the frame problem (also called the 'temporal projection$\backslash$nproblem'). Perhaps the most interesting facet of the frame problem$\backslash$nfrom a psychological perspective is that humans, in contrast to computer$\backslash$nprograms, rarely suffer from it. The Range Corollary also entails$\backslash$nthe possibility of differentiation of function, not only among constructs,$\backslash$nbut also systems and subsystems of interrelated constructs in terms$\backslash$nof their combined ranges of convenience (Adams-Webber, 1996). By$\backslash$nextension, the more functionally differentiated any system or subsystem$\backslash$nof constructs, the wider the potential range of relevance ('frame')$\backslash$nof hypotheses that can be derived within that system. Kelly's (1969J,$\backslash$npp. 119-120) 'minimax principle' implies that an ideal cognitive$\backslash$nsystem, either human or artificial, would allow the maximum number$\backslash$nof differential predictions concerning future events with the minimal$\backslash$nnumber of constructs.

abstract = {The role of story and narrative within games has been debated at length. By taking the approach that narrative can be understood with games, but only by incorporating the dynamics of game play and by accepting that existing models of narrative must be modified, this paper examines the place of narrative within role-playing games. Narrative can be defined as a description of a series of events. The description that narrative represents is experienced by the players, in an individual and personal manner. The implications of this for familiar concepts such as story and text are examined, and definitions proposed for them in the role-playing game context. Each can be best understood as unique to each participant in the game. The result shows that existing theories can be applied to the gaming context, but only with significant modification. The definitions proposed also allow for an initial consideration of how narrative is constructed in role-playing games.},

abstract = {Social computing systems are increasingly a part of people's social environment. Inherent to such communities is the collection and sharing of personal information, which in turn may raise concerns about privacy. In this study, we extend prior research on internet privacy to address questions about antecedents of privacy concerns in social computing communities, as well as the impact of privacy concerns in such communities. The results indicate that users' trust in other community members, and the community's information sharing norms have a negative impact on community-specific privacy concerns. We also find that community-specific privacy concerns not only lead users to adopt more restrictive information sharing settings, but also reduce the amount of information they share with the community. In addition, we find that information sharing is impacted by network centrality and the tenure of the user in the community. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed.},

@article{Gratton2019,
abstract = {A well functioning bureaucracy can promote prosperity, as Max Weber maintained. But when bureaucracy gets jammed-a Kafkian situation-it causes stagnation. We propose a dynamic theory of the interaction between legislation and the efficiency of bureaucracy. When bureaucracy is inefficient, the effects of politicians' legislative acts are hard to assess. Incompetent politicians thus have strong incentives of passing laws to acquire the reputation of skillful reformers. But a plethora of often contradictory laws can itself lead to a collapse in bureaucratic efficiency. This interaction can spawn both Weberian and Kafkian steady states. A temporary surge in political instability, which increases the likelihood of a premature end of the legislature, exerts pressure for reforms, or results in the appointment of short-lived technocratic governments can determine a permanent shift towards the nightmare Kafkian steady state. The aggregate experience of Italy in its transition from the so-called First to the Second Republic fits the narrative of the model quite well. Using micro-data for Italian MPs, we also provide evidence consistent with the claim that when political instability is high, politicians signal their competence through legislative activism, which leads to the overproduction of laws and norms.},

The compar-ison is based on human subjects play-ing games against artificial game-playing agents ('bots') which implement differ-ent negotiation dialogue strategies, using a chat dialogue interface to negotiate trades. Our results suggest that a negotiation strat-egy that uses persuasion, as well as a strat-egy that is trained from data using Deep Reinforcement Learning, both lead to an improved win rate against humans, com-pared to previous rule-based and super-vised learning baseline dialogue negotia-tors.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There are many different ways a robot can move in Human-Robot Interaction.
One way is to use techniques from film animation to instruct the robot to move.
This article is a systematic literature review of human-robot trials, pilots,
and evaluations that have applied techniques from animation to move a robot.
Through 27 articles, we find that animation techniques improves individual's
interaction with robots, improving individual's perception of qualities of a
robot, understanding what a robot intends to do, and showing the robot's state,
or possible emotion. Animation techniques also help people relate to robots
that do not resemble a human or robot. The studies in the articles show further
areas for research, such as applying animation principles in other types of
robots and situations, combining animation techniques with other modalities,
and testing robots moving with animation techniques over the long term.

abstract = {An important concept for intelligent agent systems is goals. Goals have two aspects: declarative (a description of the state sought), and procedural (a set of plans for achieving the goal). A declarative view of goals is necessary in order to reason about important properties of goals, while a procedural view of goals is necessary to ensure that goals can be achieved efficiently in dynamic environments. In this paper we propose a framework for goals which integrates both views. We discuss the requisite properties of goals and the link between the declarative and procedural aspects, then derive a formal semantics which has these properties. We present a high-level plan notation with goals and give its formal semantics. We then show how the use of declarative information permits reasoning (such as the detection and resolution of conflicts) to be performed on goals.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of institutional actions from the standpoint of cognitive science. The notion of constitutive rules have been proposed to describe the conceptual nature of institutions. In this paper it is extended to cover specific processes of 'recognition' that provide the agents with additional artificial powers. The power of doing an institutional action is considered as a special kind of artificial power. It is argued that institutional actions achieve their effects thanks to a cognitive and behavioral mediation of a collective of agents. Individual actions are seen and treated as (count as) institutional actions by the involved participants even if, in fact, institutional actions are collective actions. When human behavior becomes institutionalized, it acquires special conventional powers to bring about effects in the social world. A model of such conventional empowerment of an agent is proposed and is identified in a sort of collective permission. Finally it is argued that institutions are a specific kind of coordination artifacts. In particular, the importance of institutional roles as artifacts that assign conventional powers is investigated. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

They tend to mentally undo the most recent event in a temporal sequence of two events. But they tend to mentally undo the first event in a causal sequence of four events. We report the results of two experiments that show that the temporal and causal order effects are not dependent on the number of events in the sequence. Our first experiment, with 300 participants, shows that the temporal order effect occurs for sequences with four events as well as for sequences with two events. Our second experiment, with 372 participants, shows that the causal order effect occurs for sequences with two events as well as for sequences with four events. We discuss the results in terms of the mental representations that people construct of temporal and causal sequences.},

This article provides an updated account of the functional theory of counterfactual thinking, suggesting that such thoughts are best explained in terms of their role in behavior regulation and performance improvement. The article reviews a wide range of cognitive experiments indicating that counterfactual thoughts may influence behavior by either of two routes: a content-specific pathway (which involves specific informational effects on behavioral intentions, which then influence behavior) and a content-neutral pathway (which involves indirect effects via affect, mind-sets, or motivation). The functional theory is particularly useful in organizing recent findings regarding counterfactual thinking and mental health. The article concludes by considering the connections to other theoretical conceptions, especially recent advances in goal cognition.},

abstract = {In the past years, there has been a surge in game controllers that allow players to play in a more physical, more natural way. In this paper we present an experimental study of the effect of gaming using these naturally mapped controllers on the player experience in a social setting. Results support the hypothesis that more naturally mapped controllers augment spatial presence. Furthermore, the results suggest that gaming with more naturally mapped controllers augment social presence for female players, but not for male players. However, gaming via naturally mapped controllers decreases perceived control and actual performance. Hence, users with high performance expectations might not benefit from gaming via naturally mapped controllers.},

@article{Hallett2006,
abstract = {Organizational sociologists often treat institutions as macro cultural logics, representations, and schemata, with less consideration for how institutions are “inhabited” (Scully and Creed, 1997) by people doing things together. As such, this article uses a symbolic interactionist rereading of Gouldner's classic study Patterns of Industrial Bureaucracy as a lever to expand the boundaries of institutionalism to encompass a richer understanding of action, interaction, and meaning. Fifty years after its publication, Gouldner's study still speaks to us, though in ways we (and he) may not have anticipated five decades ago. The rich field observations in Patterns remind us that institutions such as bureaucracy are inhabited by people and their interactions, and the book provides an opportunity for intellectual renewal. Instead of treating contemporary institutionalism and symbolic interaction as antagonistic, we treat them as complementary components of an “inhabited institutions approach” that focuses on local and extra-local embeddedness, local and extra-local meaning, and a skeptical, inquiring attitude. This approach yields a doubly constructed view: On the one hand, institutions provide the raw materials and guidelines for social interactions (“construct interactions”), and on the other hand, the meanings of institutions are constructed and propelled forward by social interactions. Institutions are not inert categories of meaning; rather they are populated with people whose social interactions suffuse institutions with local force and significance.},

abstract = {We design, implement and evaluate a multimodal dialogue system for preschoolers that contains both story-telling and task-oriented game-play elements. Our main goal is to in- vestigate the exploration and exploitation patterns in game- play of preschoolers, as well as, the interaction patterns when preschoolers interact with Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) using voice. The application contains two modes (story and games) that roughly correspond to explo- ration and exploitation strategies, and the user is allowed to switch between those modes at will. Results show that younger children tend to use exploratory strategies more of- ten, while older children are more efficient in designing such strategies. Although there is a clear age trend, the explo- ration vs. exploitation dilemma is shown to be very much child dependent. The implications of this study for design- ing games for preschoolers are discussed.},

@article{Harris2009,
abstract = {In interactive plan-based narrative environments, users' actions must be monitored to ensure that conditions necessary for the execution of narrative plans are not compromised. In the Zocalo system, management of user actions has been performed on a reactionary basis by a process called mediation. In this paper, we describe an extension to this approach, proactive mediation, which calculates responses to user input in an anticipatory manner. A proactive mediation module accepts as input a plan describing the actions being performed by the user (generated by a plan recognition system) and identifies portions of that plan that jeopardize the causal structure of the overall narrative. Once these portions are identified, proactive mediation generates modifications to the narrative plan structure that avoid the unwanted interaction between user and story. This extension to the original mediation algorithm provides more responses to a user's actions and generates responses that are tailored to the user's activity.},

@misc{Merton1936,
abstract = {$\backslash$nAlthough the phrase, unanticipated consequences of purposive social action, is in a measures elf-explanatoryt, he setting of the prob-lem demands further specification. In the first place, the greater part of this paper deals with isolated purposive acts rather than with their integration into a coherent system of action (though some reference will be made to the latter). $\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe intended and anticipated outcomes of purposive action, however, are always, in the very nature of the case, relatively desirable to the actor, though they may seem axiologically negative to an outside observer$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe will be primarily concerned with the sum-total results of action under certain conditions. This still involves the problem of causal imputation (of which more later) though to be a less pressing degree than consequences in the rigorous sense. These sum-total or concrete consequencesm ay be differentiatedi nto (a) consequencest o the actor (s), (b) consequences to other persons mediated through (i) the social structure, (2) the culture and (3) the civilization.5 In consideringp urposivea ction, we are concernedw ith "conduct"$\backslash$nas distinct from "behavior," that is, with action which involves motives and consequentlya choice between various alternatives.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMoreover, it is not assumed that in fact social action always involves clear-cut, explicit purpose. It may well be that such awareness of purpose is unusual, that the aim of action is more often than not nebulous and hazy. This is certainly the case with habitual action which, though it may originally have been induced by conscious purpose, is characteristically performed without such awareness. The significance of such habitual action will be discussed later. Above all, it must not be inferred that purposive action implies "rationality" of human action (that persons always use the objectively most adequate means for the attainment of their end).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFor in a situation where the number of possible actions for attaining a given end is severely limited, one acts rationally by selecting the means which, on the basis of the available evidence, has the greatest probability of attaining this goal and yet the goal may actually not be attained.8 Contrariwise, an end may be attained by action which, on the basis of the knowledge available to the actor, is irrational (as in the case of "hunches"). Turning now to action, we may differentiate this into two types: (a) unorganized and (b) formally organized. The first refers to actions of individuals considered distributively out of which may grow the second when like-minded individuals form an association in order to achieve a common purpose. Unanticipated consequences may, of course, follow both types of action, though the second type would seem to afford a better opportunity for sociological analysis since the very process of formal organization ordinarily involves an explicit statement of purpose and procedure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe first involves the problem of causal imputation, the problem of ascertaining the extent to which "consequences" may justifiably be attributed to certain actions. For example, to what extent has the recent increase in economic production in this country been due to governmental measures?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe second problem is that of ascertaining the actual purposes of a given action. There is the difficulty, for instance, of discriminating between rationalization and truth in those cases where apparently unintended consequences are post facto declared to have been intended.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis difficulty, though not completely obviated, is significantly reduced in cases of organized group action since the circumstance of organized action customarily demands explicit (though not always "true") statements of goal and procedure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe most obvious limitation to a correct anticipation of consequences of action is provided by the existing state of knowledge. The extent of this limitation may be best appreciated by assuming the simplest case where this lack of adequate knowledge is the sole barriert o a correcta nticipation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAs Poincare has put it, "... small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena.... Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous phenomenon." $\backslash$n$\backslash$nAlthough no formula for the exact amount of knowledge necessary for foreknowledge is presented, one may say in general that consequences are fortuitous when an exact knowledge of many details and facts (as distinct from general principles) is needed for even a highly approximate prediction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTime and energy are scarce means and economic behavior is concerned with the rational allocation of these means among alternative wants, only one of which is the anticipation of consequences of action.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBut precisely because habit is a mode of activity which has previously led to the attainment of certain ends, it tends to become automatic and undeliberative through continued repetition so that the actor fails to recognize that procedures which have been successful in certain circumstances need not be so under any and all conditions."8 Just as rigidities in social organization often balk and block the satisfaction of new wants, so rigidities in individual behavior may block the satisfaction of old wants in a changing social environment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe third general type of factor, the "imperious immediacy of interest," refers to instances where the actor's paramount concern with the foreseen immediate consequences excludes the consideration of further or other consequences of the same act. The most prominent elements in such immediacy of interest may range from physiological needs to basic cultural values.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBut with the complex interaction which constitutes society, action ramifies, its consequences are not restricted to the specific area in which they were initially intended to center, they occur in interrelated fields explicitly ignored at the time of action. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nVan wikipedia: on strain theory$\backslash$nThis pressure, or strain if you will, is caused by the discrepancy between culturally defined goals and the institutionalized means available to achieve these goals. To illustrate this Merton argues that the dominant cultural goal in the U.S is the acquisition of wealth, as a message was depicted that happiness often equated with material success which is often associated with wealth. The socially accepted institutionalized manner of achieving these material goals was believed to be hard work and education, meaning it is widely believed that people who apply themselves to study and work will succeed financially and that those who do not succeed are labeled as either lazy or defective. According to Merton, the problem with this type of society is that the legitimate means for achieving material success are not uniformly distributed. In other words, those from wealthier backgrounds have considerably more access to legitimate means than do those who are economically disadvantaged. As a consequence, anomie, or strain, is generated and produces certain 'modes of adaptation', or (simply put) coping strategies, that the disadvantaged use to deal with the pressures that are brought to bear on them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMerton identifies five modes of adaptation: conformity, innovation, retreatism, ritualism, and rebellion. According to Merton, the innovator is the most likely to engage in criminal behavior, as the innovator accepts the socially recognized goals of society, but reject the legitimate means to achieve these goals. Consequently, the innovator uses proceeds from crimes such as fraud, theft, and illegal drug dealing to access culturally defined goals.},

abstract = {In 4 studies, the authors examined how intuitions about the relative difficulties of the sciences develop. In Study 1, familiar everyday phenomena in physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, and economics were pretested in adults, so as to be equally difficult to explain. When participants in kindergarten, Grades 2, 4, 6, and 8, and college were asked to rate the difficulty of understanding these phenomena, children revealed a strong bias to see natural science phenomena as more difficult than those in psychology. The perceived relative difficulty of economics dropped dramatically in late childhood. In Study 2, children saw neuroscience phenomena as much more difficult than cognitive psychology phenomena, which were seen as more difficult than social psychology phenomena, even though all phenomena were again equated for difficulty in adults. In Study 3, we explored the basis for these results in intuitions about common knowledge and firsthand experience. Study 4 showed that the intuitions about the differences between the disciplines were based on intuitions about difficulty of understanding and not on the basis of more general intuitions about the feasibility or truth of the phenomena in question. Taken together, in the studies, the authors find an early emerging basis for judgments that some sciences are intrinsically more difficult than others, a bias that may persevere in adults in subtler forms in such settings as the courtroom.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new language resource of events and semantic roles that characterize real-world situations. Narrative schemas contain sets of related events (edit and publish), a temporal ordering of the events (edit before publish), and the semantic roles of the participants (authors publish books). This type of world knowledge was central to early research in natural language understanding. Scripts were one of the main formalisms, representing common sequences of events that occur in the world. Unfortunately, most of this knowledge was hand-coded and time consuming to create. Current machine learning techniques, as well as a new approach to learning through coreference chains, has allowed us to automatically extract rich event structure from open domain text in the form of narrative schemas. The narrative schema resource described in this paper contains approximately 5000 unique events combined into schemas of varying sizes. We describe the resource, how it is learned, and a new evaluation of the coverage of these schemas over unseen documents},

abstract = {Over the last few years the idea of using video games for serious purposes such as education, training or health has gained widespread popularity. These games are, in contrast to their commercial counterparts, often meant to be played by single players. However, it has been shown that playing in groups trains social skills, supports collaborative learning and increases motivation. Multiplayer games therefore are especially suited for serious applications, but also pose additional challenges during their development. Since most serious games are made by smaller teams on a lower budget than commercial games, there already exist concepts to reduce the complexity of their development process. We are planning to extend one of these approaches, namely authoring tools, in order to explicitly addresses the development of multiplayer games. Our concept will include templates that reduce the complexity of their implementation and guide authors, analysis {\&} validation-algorithms that will give hints on how balanced a game is and rapid prototyping functionality that allows a single author to test the game in place of multiple players.},

The pragmatic operations whereby the continuation of an utterance in discourse motivates a reinterpretation of its truth-conditional meaning are easily treated as preliminary to a static semantic interpretation of a sentence tokened by the cumulation of utterances. Problems of anaphora, the insertion of namely variables {\&}/or negation, donkey sentences, {\&} so-called dynamic conjunction are resolved by truth-conditional semantic analyses that take into account the ubiquitous context dependence of meanings in natural language. 1 Appendix, 42 References.

abstract = {In order to regulate different circumstances over an extensive period of time, norms in institutions are stated in a vague and often ambiguous manner, thereby abstracting from concrete aspects which become instead relevant for the actual functioning of the institutions. If agent-based electronic institutions, which adhere to a set of abstract requirements, are to be built, how can those requirements be translated into more concrete constraints, the impact of which can be described directly in the institution? We address this issue considering institutions as normative systems based on articulate ontologies of the agent domain they regulate. Ontologies, we hold, are used by institutions to relate the abstract concepts in which their norms are formulated, to their concrete application domain. In this view, different institutions can implement the same set of norms in different ways as far as they presuppose divergent ontologies of the concepts in which that set of norms is formulated. In this paper we analyse this phenomenon introducing a notion of contextual ontology. We will focus on the formal machinery necessary to characterise it as well.},

abstract = {The authoring of interactive, generative narrative is a task that typically requires an extensive multi-disciplinary background in computational and narrative theory. With the increased popularity of large story-driven interactive games, the demand for truly dynamic narrative systems has grown, while the number of cross-disciplinary experts that can both design compelling plots and utilize the underlying computational power has stayed relatively small. This work aims to develop a series of complete, publicly releasable authoring interfaces that allow novice, non- technical writers and game designers to easily author plan-based interactive stories, and thereby more closely connect these creative minds to concrete implementation of their ideas. Through a process of iterative development driven by constant evaluation and lessons learned from each subsequent system, we hope to develop a series of truly usable, writer-friendly, and powerful interactive story authoring environments, and at the same time gather valuable and widely applicable insight into the requirements of interfaces aimed at novice-oriented authoring.},

We have developed a framework to analyze 3D level designs based on patterns extracted from level designers and game play sessions. We then use these patterns to analyze several game play sessions. Results of this analysis reveal methods by which designers push and pull players through levels. We discuss an analysis of these patterns in terms of three level affordance configurations, combat, environmental resistance, and mixed goals in 21 different games using one walkthrough play session per game. By looking at the variety of games, we can further explore the level similarities and differences between games},

@article{Murphie2013,
abstract = {In contemporary performance, "action" seems to include acts, emergent action and the potential for action - even sometimes non-action. Performers include the human and nonhuman, the living and the nonliving. Through all this runs a complexity of technics - technologies and techniques - and these increasingly involve computational processes. How do we think the last of these - computational processes in performance? [2] This article gives some answers to this question by engaging with four different but overlapping examples of the way that computational processes are brought into performance: the digital signal processing techique of convolution, live with the collaborative network performance softwares, keyworx. It suggests the necessity of understanding the imperceptible aspects of computaional processes, such as signal processing, as performing, even if not always directy presented. This in turn suggests a more subtle understanding of the micro-dynamics of perfomance in general. As part of this, i propose that more attention is paid to the transformation of signals of all kinds, in and perhaps even as performance. The article concludes by proposing that we now live, at least in part, in a culture of ongoing convolution of signals. Ghis is a culture more sefl-consciously immersed in the ongoing differentation (and integration) of intensities. The article therefore raises questions about the general perfomativity of a culture and technics increasingly enmeshed with computational processes.},

We first focus on the majority-preservation property, which generalizes Condorcet-consistency, and identify which of the rules satisfy it.

Finally, we consider two forms of unanimity, monotonicity, homogeneity, and reinforcement, and we identify which of the rules satisfy these properties.},

However, violation of conventional rules (norms) can cause instances of incivility which, if untreated, can cause further problems: escalating retaliation, demoralised or demotivated workforce, staff turnover, etc. In this paper, we envision the common space as a common pool resource which we seek to manage according to the institutional design principles of Elinor Ostrom. We describe the design and implementation of an affective conditioning system, which detects a violation of office norms and deterioration of (positive) affective (emotional) state of the office occupants, and seeks to restore a homeostatic equilibrium using self-regulation and forgiveness. We suggest that this convergence of normative, affective and adaptive computing demonstrates the possibilities for self-regulatory platforms for successful collective action in such communal situations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {Using an economic bargaining game, we tested for the existence of two phenomena related to social norms, namely norm manipulation - the selection of an interpretation of the norm that best suits an individual - and norm evasion - the deliberate, private violation of a social norm. We found that the manipulation of a norm of fairness was characterized by a self-serving bias in beliefs about what constituted normatively acceptable behaviour, so that an individual who made an uneven bargaining offer not only genuinely believed it was fair, but also believed that recipients found it fair, even though recipients of the offer considered it to be unfair. In contrast, norm evasion operated as a highly explicit process. When they could do so without the recipient's knowledge, individuals made uneven offers despite knowing that their behaviour was unfair. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We show that the type inference problem for a lambda calculus with records, including a record concatenation operator, is decidable. We show that this calculus does not have principal types, but does have finite complete sets of types: that is, for any term M in the calculus, there exists an effectively generable finite set of type schemes such that every typing for M is an instance of one of the schemes in the set. We show how a simple model of object-oriented programming, including hidden instance variables and multiple inheritance, may be coded in this calculus. We conclude that type inference is decidable for object-oriented programs, even with multiple inheritance and classes as first-class values. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {We present a rule specification language called Ceptre, intended to enable rapid prototyping for experimental game mechanics, especially in domains that depend on procedural generation and multi-agent simulation. Ceptre can be viewed as an explication of a new methodology for understanding games based on linear logic, a formal logic concerned with resource usage.We present a correspondence between gameplay and proof search in linear logic, building on prior work on gen- erating narratives. In Ceptre, we introduce the ability to add interactivity selectively into a generative model, en- abling inspection of intermediate states for debugging and exploration as well as a means of play. We claim that this methodology can support game de- signers and researchers in designing, anaylzing, and de- bugging the core systems of their work in generative, multi-agent gameplay. To support this claim, we pro- vide two case studies implemented in Ceptre, one from interactive narrative and one from a strategy-like do- main. Introduction},

These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better-that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited. Implications for future research are discussed.},

@book{Dormans2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

We present a framework for creating interactive narratives for entertainment, educational, and training purposes based on a type of agent called an experience manager. An experience manager (a generalization of a drama manager) is an intelligent computer agent that manipulates a virtual world to coerce a participant's experience to conform to a set of provided properties. Our realization of the experience manager automatically generates narrative content in order to adapt to the user's actions in the virtual world. The experience management framework has been used to develop an interactive version of Little Red Riding Hood and an interactive practice environment called IN-TALE for educating and training cognitive skills such as situation awareness, cultural awareness, leadership, and decisionmaking.},

abstract = {I develop a model linking specific microinteraction dynamics between$\backslash$nmembers of different institutional fields and the genesis of new$\backslash$npractices. The model centers on the concept of interstitial spaces that$\backslash$nis, small-scale settings where individuals from different fields$\backslash$ninteract occasionally and informally around common activities to which$\backslash$nthey devote limited time (e.g., hobbyist clubs, hangouts, workshops,$\backslash$nmeet-ups). I argue that the features of interstitial spaces (e.g., their$\backslash$ninstitutional diversity and their occasional and informal nature)$\backslash$nfacilitate the individuals interacting in these settings to temporarily$\backslash$nbreak free from existing institutions and experiment collectively with$\backslash$nnew activities and ideas. However, these very same features hinder the$\backslash$nconstitution of such new activities and ideas into new practices. I$\backslash$nidentify two microlevel conditions that enable the new activities and$\backslash$nideas developed in interstitial spaces to be constituted into new$\backslash$npractices: the emergence of successful interaction rituals, and the$\backslash$npresence of catalysts sustaining others' interactions and assisting the$\backslash$nconstruction of shared meanings.},

abstract = {Norms guide multi-agent systems away from being potentially an- archic towards a coordinated and collaborative society. Institutions provide an explicit, external representation of norms as well as the means to detect violations and other conditions. Each institution can be crafted individually to capture their designers' goals, but this creates a challenge at higher levels of authority in guiding the institutional design to be coordinated with other institutions and not imposing unacceptable limits on agents' rights. We propose to use institutions to govern and to revise institutions, following a princi- ple widely encountered in the social world, where treaties, primary legislation, framework agreements and subsidiarity establish a reg- ulatory space by defining norms on the form of a body of regula- tion. We set out a formal and computational framework, building on the InstAL model and implementation, to construct tiers of in- stitutions, where the norms at each tier are governed by those at the tier above. Thus, agents' behaviour is governed and monitored by a tier-1 institution, whose norms are governed and monitored by a tier-2 institution, etc.. This allows us to check the compliance of an institution with the tier above. Compliance failure generates the necessary examples for automatic norm-revision.},

abstract = {Numerous studies on the natural history of HIV-infection have revealed that the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood was the most important determining factor for the occurrence of various opportunistic infections and the most reliable prognosis indicator for the progression of HIV-infection to AIDS. It is also generally accepted that CD4+ T lymphocytes are the key cells in protective immunity in tuberculosis. Basing on these knowledges, we tried to analyze the significance of the number of CD4+ T lymphocyte in the development of clinical tuberculosis from latent infection with tubercle bacilli. Of 84 tuberculosis patients, younger than 70 years old, who had been analyzed lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry (FACS), six patients (one female, five males) had remarkably reduced number of CD4+ T lymphocytes ({\textless} or = 250 cells/mm3) by their first FACS analysis after diagnosis. Any obvious risk behavior and/or habit was noticed in none of the six patients, three of whom were in the twenties. FACS analyses of these six cases revealed that: 1) The proportion of total lymphocytes to total leukocytes was remarkably lower than that of tuberculosis patients as a whole as well as than that of healthy control group. 2) The numbers of total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes were all far below the normal range. (mean +/- 2 x SD of the control group). 3) The proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes to total lymphocytes was higher in five of these six cases, but the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes was lower in all six than the respective mean value of the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

MAJ itself is an extension of Java, so users can interleave arbitrary Java code with AspectJ code templates. MAJ is a structured meta-programming tool: a well-typed generator implies a syntactically correct generated program. MAJ promotes a methodology that combines aspect-oriented and generative programming. Potential applications range from implementing domain-specific languages with AspectJ as a back-end to enhancing AspectJ with more powerful general-purpose constructs. In addition to its practical value, MAJ offers valuable insights to meta-programming tool designers. It is a mature meta-programming tool for AspectJ (and, by extension, Java): a lot of emphasis has been placed on context-sensitive parsing and error-reporting. As a result, MAJ minimizes the number of meta-programming (quote/unquote) operators and uses type inference to reduce the need to remember type names for syntactic entities.},

abstract = {Musikdidaktik is a central subject within music teacher training in the Nordic countries. In musikdidaktik acts of teaching (music) and learning (musikdidaktik) constitute possibilities for identity formation. The objective of learning is closely connected to their future profession, in which musical and educational competences are blended, combined and used in different ways. The study presented in this article was based on a phenomenological way of thinking about education as an arena for identity development. Students' identity formation in relation to their education in musikdidaktik was investigated. In an interview study where seven musikdidaktik professors and three groups of music teacher trainees participated, the following questions were asked from a phenomenological perspective: How can education in musikdidaktik function as an arena for identity formation? What constitutes processes of music teacher trainees' identity formation? What connections can be seen between ways of teaching musikdidaktik and identity? What competences (are expected to) develop during the processes and how are they connected to employability? The results show that trainee identity formation processes can be communicated. It became evident that awareness of and reflections upon one's own experiences, learning, goals and identity development are important issues in the trainees' identity formation processes. That the trainees had the possibilities to try to act as music teachers proved to be important. When it comes to the challenges for the professor, they are primarily concerned with handling situations in a way that encourages the growth of the trainees, but also challenges them to reflect; and to be a role model, but also to offer them meetings with different role models. The competences that the trainees develop are combined in different ways within the trainees' identity formation. Musikdidaktik constitutes an arena where the students should have the opportunity to be in the world as music teachers through playing to teach music.},

In this paper, we present the design of a tag-based exploratory system and detail an experiment in understanding its effectiveness.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, Third Edition, assists judges in managing cases involving complex scientific and technical evidence by describing the basic tenets of key scientific fields from which legal evidence is typically derived and by providing examples of cases in which that evidence has been used. First published in 1994 by the Federal Judicial Center, the Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence has been relied upon in the legal and academic communities and is often cited by various courts and others. Judges faced with disputes over the admissibility of scientific and technical evidence refer to the manual to help them better understand and evaluate the relevance, reliability and usefulness of the evidence being proffered. The manual is not intended to tell judges what is good science and what is not. Instead, it serves to help judges identify issues on which experts are likely to differ and to guide the inquiry of the court in seeking an informed resolution of the conflict. The core of the manual consists of a series of chapters (reference guides) on various scientific topics, each authored by an expert in that field. The topics have been chosen by an oversight committee because of their complexity and frequency in litigation. Each chapter is intended to provide a general overview of the topic in lay terms, identifying issues that will be useful to judges and others in the legal profession. They are written for a non-technical audience and are not intended as exhaustive presentations of the topic. Rather, the chapters seek to provide judges with the basic information in an area of science, to allow them to have an informed conversation with the experts and attorneys.},

The present study set out to explore the attitudes, experiences, and feelings of online gamers. The study entailed 71 interviews with online gamers (52 males, 19 females) from 11 different countries. Six main themes emerged from the analyses of the interview transcripts: (a) online gaming and integration into day-to-day lives; (b) online gaming, excessive play, and problems; (c) addiction; (d) psychosocial impact of online gaming; (e) online gaming, dissociation, and time loss; and (f) online gaming and the alleviation of negative feelings and mood states. These findings specifically showed how gamers used MMORPGs to alleviate negative feelings and provided detailed descriptions of personal problems that had arisen due to playing MMORPGs. The implica-tions of these findings are discussed in relation to previous qualitative and quantitative research in the area.},

@article{Wilensky2015c,
abstract = {Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. — Proverbs 6:6 Ants The ant opens her eyes and looks around. There are many of her siblings nearby, but there is no food. The ant is hungry, so she heads out from the ant colony and starts to wander around. She sniffs a little to the left and a little to the right, and still she cannot smell any food. So she keeps wandering. She passes by several of her sisters, but they do not interest her right now; she has food on her mind. She keeps wandering. Sniff! Sniff! Mmmm {\ldots} good! She gets a whiff of some of that delightful pheromone stuff. She heads in the direc-tion of the strongest pheromone scent; in the past there has been food at the end of that trail. Sure enough, as the ant proceeds along the trail, she arrives at some delicious food. She grabs some food and heads back to the colony, making sure to drop some pheromone along the way. On the way back, she runs into many of her sisters, each sniffing her way along pheromone trails, repeating the same process they will carry out all day. What we have just fancifully described is an ant foraging for food. The opening para-graph of this section is in itself a model of ant behavior. By a model , we mean an abstracted description of a process, object, or event. Models can take many distinct forms. However, certain forms of models are easier to manipulate than other forms. The textual description in our first paragraph cannot easily be manipulated to answer questions about the ant colony ' s behavior — for example, what would we see if all the ants in the colony followed the behavior we described? It is difficult to extrapolate from the textual description of one ant to a description of an ant colony. The textual model is not sufficiently generative to answer such questions. It is a fixed description — always " behaving " the same, thus not bestowing any insight into the range of variation in behaviors. And it is not combinato-rial — we cannot use the description to understand the interaction of the ants with each other or with the environment. 1 22 Chapter 1 One way to make the preceding model more generalizable and gain insight into the behavior of an ant colony would be to implement the model in a computational form. A computational model is a model that takes certain input values, manipulates those inputs in an algorithmic way, and generates outputs. In computational form, it would be easy to run the " Ants " model with large numbers of ants and to observe the model ' s outputs given many possible different inputs. We use the term model implementation to refer to this process of transforming a textual model 1 into a working computational simulation (written in some form of computer " code "). Besides textual models, there are other forms of con-ceptual models that describe processes, objects, or events but are not computational; conceptual models can also be diagrammatic or pictorial. This description lends itself particularly well to being implemented, since it results from a particular standpoint, that of an individual ant, or ant agent . By the word agent , we mean an autonomous individual element of a computer simulation. These individual elements have properties, states, and behaviors. The ant is an agent. It has properties such as its appearance and its rate of movement. It has characteristic behaviors such as moving, sniffing, picking up food, and dropping pheromone. It has states such as whether or not it is carrying food (a binary state) and whether it can sense how much pheromone is in the environment around it (a multi-valued state). Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling paradigm that enables us to describe how any agent will behave. 2 The methodology of ABM encodes the behavior of individual agents in simple rules so that we can observe the results of these agents ' interactions. This technique can be used to model and describe a wide variety of processes, phenomena, and situations, but it is most useful when describing these phenomena as complex systems . Our aim in this textbook is to facilitate your creating, modifying, and analyzing the outputs of agent-based models. We begin by describing the genesis of the ant foraging conceptual model and how it was implemented as an agent-based model.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Interactive narratives have been used in a variety of applications, including video games, educational games, and training simulations. Maintaining engagement within such environments is an important problem, because it affects entertainment, motivation, and presence. Performance arts theorists have discussed and formalized many techniques that increase engagement and enhance dramatic content of art productions. While constructing a narrative manually, using these techniques, is acceptable for linear media, using this approach for interactive environments results in inflexible experiences due to the unpredictability of users' actions. Few researchers attempted to develop adaptive interactive narrative experiences. However, developing a quality interactive experience is largely an art process, and many of these adaptive techniques do not encode artistic principles. This paper presents a new interactive narrative architecture designed using a set of dramatic techniques that have been formulated based on several years of training in film and theatre.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Many information extraction (IE) systems rely on manually annotated training data to learn patterns or rules for extracting information about events. Manually annotating data is expensive, however, and a new data set must be annotated for each domain. So most IE training sets are relatively small. Consequently, IE patterns learned from annotated training sets often have limited coverage. In this paper, we explore the idea of using the Web to automatically identify domain-specific IE patterns that were not seen in the training data. We use IE patterns learned from the MUC-4 training set as anchors to identify domain-specific web pages and then learn new IE patterns from them. We compute the semantic affinity of each new pattern to automatically infer the type of information that it will extract. Experiments on the MUC-4 test set show that these new IE patterns improved recall with only a small precision loss.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

While the other two, mechanical fastening and adhesion bonding, have been the subject of wide coverage both in textbooks and monographs, fusion bonding is covered here substantially for the first time. Fusion bonding offers a number of advantages over traditional joining techniques and it is anticipated that its use will increase dramatically in the future because of the rise in the use of thermoplastic matrix composites and the growing necessity for recyclability of engineering assemblies. Fusion Bonding of Polymer Composites provides an in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the fusion bonding process, covering such topics as:- heat transfer in fusion bonding;- modelling thermal degradation;- consolidation mechanisms;- crystallisation kinetics;- processing-microstructure-property relationship;- full-scale fusion bonding;- fusion bonding of thermosetting composite/thermoplastic composite and metal/thermoplastic joints.The book focuses on one practical case study using the resistance welding process. This example exposes the reader to the development of processing windows for a novel manufacturing process including the use of experimental test programmes and modelling strategies.},

abstract = {Both the price of petroleum motor fuels and concerns regarding emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are driving attention to possible substitutes. In 2008, the world price of oil reached record highs after being adjusted for inflation, continuing a pattern of price increases over sev- eral years. Petroleum products derived from conventional crude oil constitute more than 50 percent of end-use energy deliveries in the United States and more than 95 percent of all energy used in the U.S. transportation sector. Emissions from the consumption of petroleum account for 44 percent of the nations CO2 Both the price of petroleum motor fuels and concerns regarding emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 emissions resulting from transportation-fuel use (EIA, 2007a). Commonly considered alterna- tive transportation-fuel options for the near and medium terms (roughly 1020 years) include both biomass-based fuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel) and unconventional fossil-based liquid fuels derived from such sources as heavy oils, oil sands, oil shale, and coal liquefaction. In this report, RAND researchers assess the potential future production levels, produc- are driving attention to possible substitutes. In 2008, the world price of oil reached emissions, with approximately 33 percent of national CO2 tion costs, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and other environmental implications of synthetic crude oil (SCO) produced from oil sands and transportation fuels produced via coal liquefaction (often referred to as coal-to-liquids CTL). Production of liquid fuels from a combination of coal and biomass is also considered. Although oil shale is also an important potential uncon- ventional fossil resource, we do not address it in this report because fundamental uncertainty remains about the technology that could ultimately be used for large-scale extraction, as well as about its cost and environmental implications. Te omission from this report of renewable fuel options and other propulsion technologies should not be interpreted as a conclusion that the fossil-based options are superior to others.1},

The interaction of masochistic and sadistic forces of dominance and submission along with their frequent referents, terror and trauma, is a powerful leitmotif of current society. In this article, masochism and psychopathic sadism are viewed as differing posttraumatic adaptations that rely upon defensive dissociation. The masochist has dissociated rage, aggression, and the perpetrator self-state while the psychopathic sadist has dissociated vulnerability, attachment, dependency, and the victim self-state. Specific reference is made to the influence of gender and group dynamics on individual dissociative processes, and the role of the bystander. Several conclusions are reached including that individuals live in a time that predisposes to violence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Comprehensive literature reviews of historical perspectives and evidence supporting cannabis/cannabinoids in the treatment of pain, including migraine and headache, with associated neurobiological mechanisms of pain modulation have been well described. Most of the existing literature reports on the cannabinoids $\Delta$9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), or cannabis in general. There are many cannabis strains that vary widely in the composition of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds. These components work synergistically to produce wide variations in benefits, side effects, and strain characteristics. Knowledge of the individual medicinal properties of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids is necessary to cross-breed strains to obtain optimal standardized synergistic compositions. This will enable targeting individual symptoms and/or diseases, including migraine, headache, and pain. OBJECTIVE Review the medical literature for the use of cannabis/cannabinoids in the treatment of migraine, headache, facial pain, and other chronic pain syndromes, and for supporting evidence of a potential role in combatting the opioid epidemic. Review the medical literature involving major and minor cannabinoids, primary and secondary terpenes, and flavonoids that underlie the synergistic entourage effects of cannabis. Summarize the individual medicinal benefits of these substances, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSION There is accumulating evidence for various therapeutic benefits of cannabis/cannabinoids, especially in the treatment of pain, which may also apply to the treatment of migraine and headache. There is also supporting evidence that cannabis may assist in opioid detoxification and weaning, thus making it a potential weapon in battling the opioid epidemic. Cannabis science is a rapidly evolving medical sector and industry with increasingly regulated production standards. Further research is anticipated to optimize breeding of strain-specific synergistic ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phytochemicals for predictable user effects, characteristics, and improved symptom and disease-targeted therapies.},

abstract = {Contemporary institutional theorizing in the field of organizations dates back thirty-odd years. This particularly describes what are called new or neo-institutionalisms. These terms evoke contrasts with earlier theories of the embeddedness of organizations in social and cultural contexts, now retrospectively called the ‘old institutionalism' (Hirsch {\&} Lounsbury, 1997; Stinchcombe, 1997). They went through a period of inattention, so that when institutional thinking came back in force after the 1960s, it seemed quite new. Institutional theories, as they emerged in the 1970s, received much attention in the field, along with other lines of thought emphasizing the dependence of modern organizations on their environments. Perhaps surprisingly, they continue to receive atten- tion, and seem to retain substantial measures of vigor. One secondary aim, here, is to explain why. I primarily review the status and prospects of the principal themes of institutional theory. I concentrate on sociological institutionalism, as capturing core ideas in their most dramatic form, rather than the limited arguments emphasized in economics or political science. And within sociological versions, I concen- trate on phenomenological theories. These reflect my own interests, are continuing loci of research creativity, and contrast most sharply with other lines of social scientific theorizing about organizations. In practice, ‘organizations' tends to be both a research field, and a realist ideology about modern society: phenomenological thinking steps back from that commitment, and is useful in analyzing, for example, why so much formal organization exists in the modern world (Drori, Meyer,{\&} Hwang, 2006).},

abstract = {This paper proposes that long rebalancing cascades (stock A's price jumps, which causes a fund to buy stock A and sell stock B, which causes a second fund to sell stock B and buy stock C, which causes...) generate noise in financial markets. First, we use a random-networks model to show that, when funds follow many different threshold-based trading strategies, a change in stock A's fundamentals can trigger a long rebalancing cascade that eventually affects the demand for unrelated stocks, like stock Z. Then, we prove that in a large market it's computationally infeasible to predict whether a long rebalancing cascade will result in buy or sell orders for stock Z. The best you can do is compute stock Z's susceptibility to these erratic non-fundamental demand shocks. By analogy, although the population of France is not a random number, whether this number is even or odd may as well be (Keynes, 1921). Finally, we use data on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to give empirical evidence for our noise-generating mechanism. We find that, in the days immediately after a stock is announced as an M{\&}A target, unrelated stocks on the other side of the market realize larger increases in trading volume when they are more susceptible to long rebalancing cascades. And, this additional trading volume is associated with higher levels of liquidity and more informed trading, suggesting that market participants view these long rebalancing cascades as noise.},

abstract = {Clustering is often a first step when trying to make sense of a large data set. A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hi- erarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node- link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix in- teractive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the rela- tionship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clus- ters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clus- tering results},

abstract = {Scientific social trends ranging from dynamical systems theories to postmodernism have called into question whether the apparent hierarchical structure of naturally occurring intelligent behaviour actually derives from structured intelligence. These questions and perspectives overlook substantial evidence from both neuroscience and biology more broadly that behaviour really is organised utilising both modularity and hierarchy. In mammal brains, modular structure starts from cellular composition, and continues conspicuously through the existence of discrete regions with differing processing capacities (Badre, 2008). We can discriminate a brain region by its consistent and regular pattern of nerve-cell type and intercell connectivity, while these same features vary between regions. Hierarchy derives from the interaction between these modules. This is particularly apparent when we can produce complex movements such as the production of particular words (Mateer et al., 1990) or grasping and transfer gestures (Graziano et al., 2002) by directly stimulating single cells.},

abstract = {Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within, and relating to, living organisms.[1] By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life. Over the last 40 years biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research.[2] Today the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which genetic information encoded in DNA is able to result in the processes of life. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used, molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions. These can be inorganic, for example water and metal ions, or organic, for example the amino acids which are used to synthesise proteins. The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism},

Designers are faced with two concurrent, difficult tasks: firstly specifying the relationships (over time) of agents' actions and their effects, and secondly combining this model with another that captures the agents' permissions and obligations. In this paper we present our model and operational semantics for specifying individual and collective institutions and outline a declarative action language for describing them. We demonstrate, by way of an example, how this may be used to enable the analysis of institutional specifications either for simply visualising possible outcomes or for checking for absence or presence of certain (un)desirable correctness properties.},

abstract = {Yes, it is possible to be all things to all people, if you're talking about the Emacs editor. As a user, you can make any kind of customization you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever developed before. It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but fast-paced book. GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things. To provide such a broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs). GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it already provides. In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. Examples progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major modes. You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well, making learning pleasant and natural.},

In this paper we propose a possible integration of the two views and support it proposing the idea of "Words As social Tools" (WAT). In this respect, we will propose that words, also due to their social and public character, can be conceived as quasi-external devices that extend our cognition. Moreover, words function like tools in that they enlarge the bodily space of action thus modifying our sense of body. To support our proposal, we review the relevant literature on tool-use and on words as tools and report recent evidence indicating that word use leads to an extension of space close to the body. In addition, we outline a model of the neural processes that may underpin bodily space extension via word use and may reflect possible effects on cognition of the use of words as external means. We also discuss how reconciling the two perspectives can help to overcome the limitations they encounter if considered independently.},

We draw on what speech act theory says about how trust, meaning and communication are achieved in human conversation, applying these notions to interactive storytelling. This new perspective on agency provides us with a better analytical tool for understanding the relationship between interaction and narrative pleasure, and provides a useful metric for designers of story- rich games. eScholarship},

abstract = {How do income shocks affect armed conflict? Theory suggests two opposite effects. If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict.We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not).We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect.We also show that this pattern holds in six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence that price shocks affect conflict in different directions depending on the type of the commodity.},

abstract = {Over the past three years it has become evident that fake news is a danger to democracy. However, until now there has been no clear understanding of how to define fake news, much less how to model it. This paper addresses both these issues. A definition of fake news is given, and two approaches for the modelling of fake news and its impact in elections and referendums are introduced. The first approach, based on the idea of a representative voter, is shown to be suitable to obtain a qualitative understanding of phenomena associated with fake news at a macroscopic level. The second approach, based on the idea of an election microstructure, describes the collective behaviour of the electorate by modelling the preferences of individual voters. It is shown through a simulation study that the mere knowledge that pieces of fake news may be in circulation goes a long way towards mitigating the impact of fake news.},

@article{Lindemann2011,
abstract = {While I was conducting field research on professional dominatrices (‘pro-dommes'), an unexpected discourse emerged: respondents repeatedly characterized themselves as ‘therapists', speaking about their work as a form of psychological treatment for their clients. This article examines the way they speak about BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism) as therapeutic. Data are derived from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 66 female pro-dommes. The rhetoric used by participants in this form of commercial eroticism ‘on the ground' has implications for feminist theoretical claims about the potential value of classifying erotic labor as ‘sex therapy' as well as resonance with other socially stigmatized erotic practices.},

abstract = {One approach to moderating the expected behaviour of agents in open societies is the use of explicit languages for defining norms, conditional com- mitments and/or social expectations, together with infrastructure supporting con- formance checking. This paper presents a logical account of the fulfilment and violation of social expectations modelled as conditional rules over a hybrid lin- ear propositional temporal logic. Our semantics captures the intuition that the fulfilment or violation of an expectation must be determined without recourse to information from later states. We define a means of updating expectations from one state to the next based on formula progression, and show how conformance checking was implemented by extending the MCLITE and MCFULL algorithms of the Hybrid Logics Model Checker. 1},

abstract = {Narrative is an important part of the way we interact with and make sense of the world. Interactive narrative systems tell stories in a virtual world in which the user is an interactive participant. Since the behaviors the user performs in the virtual world can affect the way in which a storyline unfolds, interactive narrative systems often use a branching story structure where non-interactive story presentations are interleaved with user decision points. An alternative approach – narrative mediation – represents story as a linear progression of events with anticipated user actions and system-controlled agent actions together in a partially-ordered plan. For every possible way the user can violate the story plan, an alternative story plan is generated. If narrative mediation is powerful enough to express the same interactive stories as systems that use branching story structures, then linear narrative generation techniques can be applied to interactive narrative generation with the use of narrative mediation. This paper sketches out a proof that narrative mediation is at least as powerful as acyclic branching story structures.},

abstract = {Although the institutional dimension of a multi-agent sys- tem can be affected directly by the actions of the agents, it can be also affected by facts originating in the environment or even in the institu- tion. In previous work, we proposed a model, language and its interpreter to specify the institutional consequences of both events and states from environment and institution. This paper analyses this twofold approach, looking for a better understanding about the performance of the inter- preter and about the design differences between using event and states. The contributions of this work are (i) the evaluation of some aspects of a proposed and implemented language, (ii) guidelines to choose between events and states to model count-as rules, and (iii) an initial benchmark to evaluate further improvements to the interpreter and the performance of similar proposals.},

abstract = {We propose a method for the task of iden-tifying the general positions of users in online debates, i.e., support or oppose the main topic of an online debate, by ex-ploiting local information in their remarks within the debate. An online debate is a forum where each user post an opin-ion on a particular topic while other users state their positions by posting their re-marks within the debate. The supporting or opposing remarks are made by directly replying to the opinion, or indirectly to other remarks (to express local agreement or disagreement), which makes the task of identifying users' general positions diffi-cult. A prior study has shown that a link-based method, which completely ignores the content of the remarks, can achieve higher accuracy for the identification task than methods based solely on the contents of the remarks. In this paper, we show that utilizing the textual content of the remarks into the link-based method can yield higher accuracy in the identification task.},

abstract = {The increased diffusion of the Internet has made computer-mediated communication (CMC) very popular. However, a difficult question arises for psychologists and communication researchers: "What are the communicative characteristics of CMC?" According to the "cues-filtered-out" approach, CMC lacks the specifically relational features (social cues), which enable the interlocutors to identify correctly the kind of interpersonal situations they find themselves in. This paper counters this vision by integrating in its theoretical frame the different psycho-social approaches available in current literature. In particular, the paper describes the characteristics of the socio-cognitive processes-emotional expression, context definition, and identity creation-used by the interlocutors to make order and create relationships out of the miscommunication processes typical of CMC. Moreover, it presents the emerging forms of CMC-instant messaging, shared hypermedia, weblogs, and graphical chats-and their possible social and communicative effects.},

abstract = {ContextL is an extension to the Common Lisp Object System that allows for Context-oriented Programming. It provides means to associate partial class and method definitions with layers and to activate and deactivate such layers in the control flow of a running program. When a layer is activated, the partial definitions become part of the program until this layer is deactivated. This has the effect that the behavior of a program can be modified according to the context of its use without the need to mention such context dependencies in the affected base program. We illustrate these ideas by providing different UI views on the same object while, at the same time, keeping the conceptual simplicity of object-oriented programming that objects know by themselves how to behave, in our case how to display themselves. These seemingly contradictory goals can be achieved by separating class definitions into distinct layers instead of factoring out the display code into different classes.},

abstract = {This article aims to explain the lethal violence against women observed in certain contexts in recent years. It analyses the phenomenon of female homicide victimization through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic violence. The principal manifestation of homicide of female victims explored in this article are honour killings in migrant communities in Europe, a culturally specific form of gender-related homicide. The concept of symbolic violence partially explains the honour-related violence within the framework of patriarchal theories and emphasizes the function of direct violence against women as a patriarchal backlash in a situation of structural changes in gender relations. Applying Bourdieu's theory to honour killings in Europe will explain the dynamics of violence against women in a situation where symbolic patriarchal power is undermined, due to new structural conditions, and offer guidelines on context and agent-focused approaches to tackling the phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

This crowdsourced project examined time of semester variation in 10 known effects, 10 individual differences, and 3 data quality indicators over the course of the academic semester in 20 participant pools (N = 2696) and with an online sample (N = 737). Weak time of semester effects were observed on data quality indicators, participant sex, and a few individual differences—conscientiousness, mood, and stress. However, there was little evidence for time of semester qualifying experimental or correlational effects. The generality of this evidence is unknown because only a subset of the tested effects demonstrated evidence for the original result in the whole sample. Mean characteristics of pool samples change slightly during the semester, but these data suggest that those changes are mostly irrelevant for detecting effects.},

This work surveys the growing number of approaches in this discipline. We derive a hierarchical taxonomy of techniques by systematically categorizing and tagging publica- tions. While static graph visualizations are often divided into node-link and matrix representations, we identify the representation of time as the major distinguishing feature for dynamic graph visualizations: either graphs are represented as animated diagrams or as static charts based on a timeline. Evaluations of animated approaches focus on dynamic stability for preserving the viewer's mental map or, in general, compare animated diagrams to timeline-based ones. Finally, we identify and discuss challenges for future research.},

Experiments presented in this paper, using a hybrid system inspired by robot motion planning and with nonlinear dynamics associated with each of several thousand modes, provide an initial validation of HyDICE and demonstrate its promise as a hybrid-system testing method.

Since the advent of the movement in the early 1920s, the marriage of surrealism and photography has found in architecture one of its privileged subjects, producing impossible architectural fantasies covered with a veil of reality. With the arrival of digital photo-manipulation tools, this experimentation has undergone a radical expansion, giving rise to a great variety of approaches that play with photographic imagery in order to produce impossible but fascinating architectural scenarios. This article focuses on the work of Jim Kazanjian, an author coming from the realm of digital building who, working on the fringes of the discipline, has produced throughout the last decad, a body of work that combines technical prowess with the fascination with the somber atmospheres of H.P. Lovecraft o Algernon Blackwood's tales as a means to produce improbable architectural objects of dark but delicate beauty.},

@book{Agliardi2002,
abstract = {Discovering Artificial Economics is an informal introduction to the ideas of modern systems theory and self-organization as they apply to problems in the economic realm. David Batten interleaves anecdotes and stories with technical discussions, in order to provide the general reader with a good feel for how economies function and change. Using a wealth of examples from evolutionary game theory, to stock markets, to urban and traffic planning, Batten shows how economic agents interact to produce the behavior we have come to recognize as economic life. Despite the book's easy-to-read style, Batten's message is quite profound. Strongly interactive groups of agents can produce unexpected collective behavior, emergent features which are lawful in their own right. These patterns of emergent behavior are the hallmark of a complex, self-organizing economy.Batten discards many traditional axioms of economic behavior. Far from displaying perfectly deductive rationality to achieve a predictable economic equilibrium, his agents face an economy that is open and dynamic. There we find evolution, heterogeneity and instabilities; stochastic and deterministic phenomena; unexpected regularities as well as equally unexpected, large-scale fluctuations. Interacting agents are forced to be intuitive and adaptive, because they must respond to a continuously changing economic landscape. Because complexity theory attempts to study a large number of agents, and their changing interaction patterns, it often gets too difficult for a mathematical solution. Thus, many of the anecdotes and results discussed in the book have emerged from agent-based computer simulations. The message is that the social sciences are poised on the verge of a new scientific era, one in which economists will conduct experiments inside their own computers. Welcome to the new age of Artificial Economics.},

abstract = {Norms have never been absent from the study of international politics, but the sweeping "ideational turn" in the 1980s and 1990s brought them back as a central theoretical concern in the field. Much theorizing about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role in creating political change, but change processes have been less well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage "life cycle" of emergence, "norm cascades," and internalization, and that each stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress will only be made by placing attention on the connections between norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},

abstract = {Psychological essentialism is the idea that certain categories, such as "lion" or "female", have an underlying reality that cannot be observed directly. Where does this idea come from? This article reviews recent evidence suggesting that psychological essentialism is an early cognitive bias. Young children look beyond the obvious in many converging ways: when learning words, generalizing knowledge to new category members, reasoning about the insides of things, contemplating the role of nature versus nurture, and constructing causal explanations. These findings argue against the standard view of children as concrete thinkers, instead claiming that children have an early tendency to search for hidden, non-obvious features.},

@misc{Bourdieu1992,
abstract = {Over the last three decades, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has produced one of the most imaginative and subtle bodies of social theory and research of the post war era. Yet, despite the influence of his work, no single introduction to his wide-ranging oeuvre is available. This book, intended for an English-speaking audience, offers a systematic and accessible overview, providing interpretive keys to the internal logic of Bourdieu's work by explicating thematic and methodological principles underlying his work. The structure of Bourdieu's theory of knowledge, practice, and society is first dissected by Loic Wacquant; he then collaborates with Bourdieu in a dialogue in which they discuss central concepts of Bourdieu's work, confront the main objections and criticisms his work has met, and outline Bourdieu's views of the relation of sociology to philosophy, economics, history, and politics. The final section captures Bourdieu in action in the seminar room as he addresses the topic of how to practice the craft of reflexive sociology. Throughout, they stress Bourdieu's emphasis on reflexivity—his inclusion of a theory of intellectual practice as an integral component of a theory of society—and on method—particularly his manner of posing problems that permits a transfer of knowledge from one area of inquiry into another.},

In this fashion, I enlisted my readers in the service of a grand experiment, to see how my book could find its way into cultural relevance and commercial success. The experiment worked out very satisfactorily. When I originally licensed the book under the terms set out in the next section, I did so in the most conservative fashion possible, using CC's most restrictive license. I wanted to dip my toe in before taking a plunge. I wanted to see if the sky would fall: you see writers are routinely schooled by their peers that maximal copyright is the only thing that stands between us and penury, and so ingrained was this lesson in me that even though I had the intellectual intuition that a "some rights reserved" regime would serve me well, I still couldn't shake the atavistic fear that I was about to do something very foolish indeed. It wasn't foolish. I've since released a short story collection: A Place So Foreign and Eight More http://craphound.com/place and a second novel: Eastern Standard Tribe http://craphound.com/est in this fashion, and my career is turning over like a goddamned locomotive engine. I am thrilled beyond words (an extraordinary circumstance for a writer!) at the way that this has all worked out. And so now I'm going to take a little bit of a plunge. Today, in coincidence with my talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference: Ebooks: Neither E, Nor Books http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/esess/4693 I am re-licensing this book under a far less restrictive Creative Commons license, the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license.

abstract = {Agency, being one's ability to perform an action and have some influence over the world, is fundamental to interactive entertainment. Although much of the games industry is concerned with providing more agency to its players, what seems to matter more is how much agency each player will actually perceive. In this paper, we present a computational model of this phenomena, based on the notion that the amount of agency that one perceives depends on how much they desire the outcomes that result from their decisions. Using a structure for high-agency stories that we designed specifically for this intent, we present the results of a 141-participant user study that tests our model's ability to select subsequent events in an original interactive story. Using a newly validated survey instrument for measuring both agency and fun, we found with a high degree of confidence that event sequences selected by our model result in players perceiving more agency than players who experience event sequences that our model does not recommend.},

Only a small subset of trauma victims develops PTSD ({\textless}10{\%}). Increased incidence of other disorders following trauma exposure occurs primarily among trauma victims with PTSD. Female victims of traumatic events are at higher risk for PTSD than male victims are. Direct evidence on the causes of the sex difference in the conditional risk of PTSD is unavailable. The available evidence suggests that the sex difference is not due to (a) the higher occurrence of sexual assault among females, (b) prior traumatic experiences, (c) preexisting depression or anxiety disorder, or (d) sex-related bias in reporting. Observed sex differences in anxiety, neuroticism, and depression, inducing effects of stressful experiences, might provide a theoretical context for further inquiry into the greater vulnerability of females to PTSD.},

abstract = {Many psychological studies have shown that when we act, and especially when we interact, we consciously and unconsciously attend to context of many types. Sensors can pick up some but not all context that is acquired through our senses. Some context is lost, some is added, and captured context is presented in new ways. Digital aggregators and interpreters do not aggregate and interpret the same way we do. Missing or altered context disrupts our processing of information in ways that we may not recognize. To address the disruption we may use additional sensors to capture and deliver some of the missing context. Learning to handle these new conduits is then a further source of disruption, and on it can go. With greater knowledge of context, we can work and interact more efficiently, assuming that we can learn to take advantage of the information without being overwhelmed. However, converting contextual information to a digital format changes it in specific ways. Transient information becomes more permanent, local information is made available globally, and information that once spread slowly can spread much more quickly. The information can enable us to work more efficiently, but these changes in its nature have profound indirect effects. The potential loss of privacy is widely discussed, but other effects may be more significant. In particular, the loss of confinement and transience of information creates an environment that is fundamentally unnatural, in conflict with the one we evolved to live in.},

There is little formal understanding of this process, but rather a large body of design lore and rules of thumb. As a result, there is no accepted common language for describing the building blocks of level design and the gameplay they create. This dissertation presents a set of level design patterns for first-person shooter (FPS) gaproviding cause-effect relationships between level design patterns and gameplay. These relationships are explored through analysis of data gathered in an extensive user study. This work is the first scientific study of level design, laying the foundation for further work in this area. Data driven approaches to understand gameplay have been attempted in the past, but this work takes it to a new level by showing specific cause- effect relationships between the design of the level and player behavior. The result of this dissertation is a resource for designers to help them understand how they are creating gameplay through their art. The pattern collection allows them to explore design space more fully and create richer and more varied experiences.},

Although in this game the player cannot directly control the intelligent agents, he can give some intuitions to them. Together with these intuitions the agents, called Jivas {\$}the most developed species of the ecosystem, devise actions through evolutionary computation. The game allows also the observation of all interactions among the various beings inhabiting Vidya. Interactions happen in a quasi-autonomous manner which grants the game with an interesting dynamics.

Current cognitive-science research addresses the issues that are directly relevant to the connection between normal cognitive functioning and such judicial errors, and suggests means by which the false-conviction rate could be reduced. Here, we illustrate how this can be achieved by reviewing recent work in two related areas: eyewitness testimony and fingerprint analysis. We articulate problems in these areas with reference to specific legal cases and demonstrate how recent findings can be used to address them. We also discuss how researchers can translate their conclusions into language and ideas that can influence and improve the legal system. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Based on a field study of cooperative design in a distributed company, this paper identifies and defines the embodied actions of the designers that enabled a cooperative design process. These actions are considered as classes of cognitive practices that are simultaneously available to the actor and others in a shared physical workspace. The public availability of these actions to the perceptions of the participants in a cooperative process enables their communicative functions A taxonomy of embodied actions is developed as a bridging structure between the field study of cooperative work and the design of technology that might support that work over distance. Boundaries are drawn by mapping practices; "objects" do not pre-exist as such. Objects are boundary projects. But boundaries shift from within; boundaries are very tricky. What boundaries provisionally contain remains generative, productive of meanings and bodies. Siting (sighting) boundaries is a risky practice. Donna Haraway, Situated Knowledges, 1991, p. 200},

An emphasis on pure functions, a strong typing system, and a lack of loops and other conventional features make it harder to learn for programmers familiar only with imperative programming. One particular problem I faced during my initial contact with Haskell was unclear error messages. Later, seeing some discussions on {\#}haskell, I noticed that I wasn't the only one. Correcting a program without understanding error messages is not an easy task. In this tutorial, I aim to remedy this problem by explaining how to understand Haskell's error messages. I will present code snippets that generate errors, followed by explanations and solutions. I used GHC 7.4.1 and Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0 [1] for demonstration. I assume reader's working knowledge of GHCi. I also assume that reader knows how data types are constructed, what type classes are and how they are used.

@book{Knobbout2016,
abstract = {A multi-agent system is a computerized system that is composed of multiple interacting agents within an environment. Such an agent can be a software program, but could equally well be a human actor. These systems are making their way into our everyday life, for example electronic marketplaces where agents can buy and sell goods, or smart grid energy systems where agents can produce or consume energy based on supply and demand. These systems are typically distributed and decentralized, and the participating agents may have diverging information, diverging interests, or both. The internals and architecture of these participating agents may be unknown to us, which disables us to make any strong assumption on the possible behaviour that these agents may exhibit. Moreover, these systems are generally composed or designed with a specific goal in mind. For example, an electronic marketplace is composed to facilitate safe transactions between currency and goods. Depending on the actual behaviour of the system these goals may, or may not, be achieved. Hence there is a need to regulate and control the behaviour of the system and the participating agents. In order to achieve this, norms have been proposed to regulate, coordinate, and control the behaviour of the agents and system, leading to the field of research called normative multi-agent systems. In this thesis we study enforcement norms, which are norms which can be violated, and which can lead to sanctions when a violation is detected. However, it can be the case that the norms are not well-designed, and that there exists ways for an agent to exploit the system. This may for example lead to dangerous situations within the system, or high costs for the designer. As these normative multi-agent systems can grow in size and scale, formal methods and tools are needed in order to prove whether such a system works as intended. This thesis aims to design and analyse formal logic-based frameworks in which normative multi-agent systems can be modelled and verified. Specifically, we design frameworks that aim to capture the behaviour of a normative multi-agent system, and we develop logics to reason about properties of such a system. Ultimately these logics can be used to verify the correctness of these systems. Apart from the many theoretical results, an important contribution this thesis makes is that it bridges the gap between the field of normative multi-agent systems and the modelling and verification of formal systems.},

In this practical guide, author Matthew Kirk takes you through the principles of TDD and machine learning, and shows you how to apply TDD to several machine-learning algorithms, including Naive Bayesian classifiers and Neural Networks. Machine-learning algorithms often have tests baked in, but they can't account for human errors in coding. Rather than blindly rely on machine-learning results as many researchers have, you can mitigate the risk of errors with TDD and write clean, stable machine-learning code. If you're familiar with Ruby 2.1, you're ready to start. • Apply TDD to write and run tests before you start coding • Learn the best uses and tradeoffs of eight machine learning algorithms • Use real-world examples to test each algorithm through engaging, hands-on exercises • Understand the similarities between TDD and the scientific method for validating solutions • Be aware of the risks of machine learning, such as underfitting and overfitting data • Explore techniques for improving your machine-learning models or data extraction},

abstract = {This is a book about how to prove theorems. Until this point in your education, mathematics has probably been presented as a primarily computational discipline. You have learned to solve equations, compute derivatives and integrals, multiply matrices and find determinants; and you have seen how these things can answer practical questions about the real world. In this setting, your primary goal in using mathematics has been to compute answers. But there is another side of mathematics that is more theoretical than computational. Here the primary goal is to understand mathematical structures, to prove mathematical statements, and even to invent or discover new mathematical theorems and theories. The mathematical techniques and procedures that you have learned and used up until now are founded on this theoretical side of mathematics. For example, in computing the area under a curve, you use the fundamental theorem of calculus. It is because this theorem is true that your answer is correct. However, in learning calculus you were probably far more concerned with how that theorem could be applied than in understanding why it is true. But how do we know it is true? How can we convince ourselves or others of its validity? Questions of this nature belong to the theoretical realm of mathematics. This book is an introduction to that realm. This book will initiate you into an esoteric world. You will learn and apply the methods of thought that mathematicians use to verify theorems, explore mathematical truth and create new mathematical theories. This will prepare you for advanced mathematics courses, for you will be better able to understand proofs, write your own proofs and think critically and inquisitively about mathematics.},

Moreover, prototype user evaluations are often far from real with respect to user representatives, tasks, and measures. But to get real in HCI prototyping and evaluations risks placing even greater (more unrealistic) demands upon the HCI researcher.

Its essence is to view programming language learning as a natural science activity, where students probe languages experimentally to understand both the normal and extreme behaviors of their features. This has natural parallels to the "security mindset" of computer security, with languages taking the place of servers and other systems. The approach is modular (with minimal dependencies), incremental (it can be introduced slowly into existing classes), interoperable (it does not need to push out other, existing methods), and complementary (since it introduces a new mode of thinking).},

According to the author, "a quest is a journey across a symbolic, fantastic landscape in which a protagonist or player collects objects and talks to characters in order to overcome challenges and achieve a meaningful goal." For example, Mario is on a quest to save the princess in Super Mario Brothers. This unique take on quests brings together literary and New Media theorizations of the quest in a way that can allow designers to create better games. It shows how quests can be a bridge between seemingly opposed ideas, including game and narrative, gaming and literature, technology and mythology, and meaning and action. The book deals with both the theory and the practice of the four main aspects of quests: spaces, objects, actors and challenges. Each practical section contains accompanying exercises and suggestions useful for designing quests.},

@book{Tidemann2009,
abstract = {The research in this thesis aims to enable robots to imitate humans. Learning by imitation is a fundamental part of human behaviour, since it allows humans to acquire motor skills simply by demonstration; seen from a robotic viewpoint you can easily “program” your fellow humans by showing them what to do. Would it not be great if the same mechanism could be used to program robots? A robot is programmed by specifying the torque of its motors. The torque can be regarded as the force or strength that is the result of muscles contracting or relaxing. Typical approaches to determine motor torques that will lead to a desired behaviour include setting them manually, i.e. on a trial-and-error basis, or specifying them by mathematical equations. Neither of these are intuitive to most humans, so most robot behaviours are programmed by engineers. However, if an engineer was to design a preprogrammed housekeeping robot, it would be very hard to program all the possible behaviours the robot could be expected to perform, even in such a limited domain. It is much more cost-efficient to make the robot learn what to do. This would allow the robot to adapt to its human owner, and not the other way around. Since humans easily learn new behaviours by imitating others, it would be ideal if humans could use the same technique to transfer motor knowledge to robots. I believe research in this area could be of great help to bridge the human-robot interaction gap that currently exists, so that you could have truly intelligent robots that could assist people in everyday life. To understand imitation learning, knowledge of psychology and neuroscience is required. The research in this thesis has taken an interdisciplinary approach, studying the desired mechanism on both a behavioural and neuroscientific level. I have focused on imitation in a musical setting. The system can both see and hear, and seeks to imitate the perceived behaviour. The application has been to create an intelligent virtual drummer, that imitates both the physical playing style (i.e. the movement of the arms) as well as the musical playing style (i.e. the groove) of the teacher. The virtual drummer will then both look and sound like a human drummer. The research in this thesis presents a multi-modal architecture for imitation of human movements. I have been working on simulated robots due to limits of time and money, however the principles of my research have been developed in a platformindependent way, so it should be applicable to real robots as well.},

@phdthesis{MitchellAlexa2012,
abstract = {There are very particular reasons why people want to go back to reexperience stories, reasons which are not necessarily applicable to stories that change as the result of reader choice. This raises the question: what is known about re-reading – especially rereading in the context of interactive stories? Although there have been some discussions of rereading in non-interactive stories, and some implementations of interactive stories which are intended to be reexperienced, there has been very little work which directly addresses the nature of rereading in the context of interactive stories. Work on rereading in interactive stories tends to argue that people reread either to experience variation or to look for closure. Implementation efforts generally follow the former perspective. Previous work has not, however, investigated how rereading actually changes in the context of interactive stories. To address this issue, implementations of prototype hypertext stories were created, empirical studies were carried out on these stories, and critical analyses of existing theories and creative works were conducted. Based on an analysis of existing stories, a classification of motivations for rereading and a categorization of techniques for encouraging and rewarding rereading in interactive stories were developed. This was followed by two empir- ical studies of rereading of procedural hypertext fiction. The first study showed that, when rereading, readers are looking for some form of closure. The second study showed that readers have difficulty deciding whether or not what they are doing as they go back over an interactive story can be called “rereading”. From the insights gained in these studies, a new model of rereading in in- teractive stories is proposed. The model focuses on what the reader is doing when rereading. In this model, readers who are rereading to find closure are rereading to complete a “first” reading. It is only when readers achieve this closure that they can potentially shift to either rereading to reexperience the story, or rereading reflectively or analytically. This involves a change from doing the same thing each time the story is read, to doing something different. This shift highlights the paradoxical nature of rereading. Rereading, rather than in- volving reading something again, actually involves reading anew. This paradox is foregrounded in interactive stories, where what is being “reread” may literally be different on each rereading. This thesis contributes to the literature on interactive storytelling by a) ex- panding the research field to include study of the phenomenon of rereading, b) providing a model by which to both analyze and design interactive stories which are intended to be reread, and c) suggesting new ways to approach inter- active stories in general. In addition, this thesis contributes to the literature on rereading by a) extending the concept of rereading to interactive stories, and b) suggesting new ways of thinking about rereading in all forms of stories, whether static or interactive. Finally, the thesis contributes to methodology, by intro- ducing an approach to studying interactive stories using a modified Piagetian “clinical interview” combined with the creation of stories specifically designed to investigate reader behaviour.},

abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

abstract = {In our increasingly interconnected world, the need for reputation is becoming more important as larger numbers of people and services interact online. Reputation is a tool to facilitate trust between entities, as it increases the efficiency and effectiveness of online services and communities. As most entities will not have any direct experience of other entities, they must increasingly come to rely on reputation systems. Such systems allow the prediction who is likely to be trustworthy based on feedback from past transactions. In this paper we introduce a new taxonomy for reputation systems, along with: a reference model for reputation context, a model of reputation systems, a substantial survey, and a comparison of existing reputation research and deployed reputation systems.},

@article{Martinez2017,
abstract = {This article analyzes the limits of the Mexican government´s ability to guarantee the rights of indigenous communities and the steps taken by those communities to try to ensure that their rights are guaranteed in practice. This analysis contributes to anthropological literature on the state, and shows that state formation and state functions may take place outside of governmental institutions. The case of the Cerro de Oro hydroelectric plant project in Oaxaca, Mexico, reveals how rights are ignored by state officials and subordinated to powerful economic interests in a new phase of capitalist expansion. The main hypothesis here is that the neoliberal state generates a situation of tense contradictions by simultaneously trying to guarantee the economic interests of transnational enterprises and the rights of indigenous people. Within this contradiction, the Mexican government abandons the exercise of sovereignty, generating disputes among private enterprises and local communities as they attempt to assume the functions of state, or state-ness. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the American Anthropological Association},

The Bayesian approach allows the integration of uncertainty in the data, models and model parameters in a coherent and consistent manner. Bayesian methodology for time-series forecasting is introduced, including autoregressive (AR) and stochastic volatility (SV) models. These models are then fitted to a historical time series of data from 1841 to 2007 and used to predict future population totals to 2033. These results are compared to the most recent projections produced by the Office for National Statistics. Sensitivity analyses are then performed to test the effect of changes in the prior uncertainty for a single parameter. Finally, in-sample forecasts are compared with actual population and previous official projections. The article ends with some conclusions and recommendations for future work.},

abstract = {Nature-related transactions are typical for agriculture, horticulture, fishery and forestry which interact frequently with natural systems. This interaction represents a source of enforcement problems and transaction costs in the context of governing transactions. Institutional analysis frameworks used in agricultural economics should consider the particular properties of transactions involving natural systems. For ordering nature-related transactions, we propose a heuristic framework based on two dimensions: ‘modularity and decomposability of structures' and ‘functional interdependence of processes'. It serves as a starting point for establishing a typology ranging from ‘atomistic-isolated transactions' to ‘complexinterconnected transactions'. The complex process of institutionalising such transactions is decomposed into conceptual categories by means of a ‘transaction-interdependence cycle'.},

abstract = {Some problems in procedural content generation for games involve hard constraints (e.g. that a generated puzzle is necessarily solvable). Common techniques for generator design lack a way to specify crisp (yes/no) constraints on what counts as a valid content artifact and guarantee these constraints are satisfied in the generator's output. In this paper we present two independent implementations of three diverse level design automation tools for the popular online educational game Refraction. All of the systems guarantee key properties of their output. Applying a constraint-focused generator design perspective in depth, we found that even emergent aesthetic style properties were straightforward to directly control. Our results with Refraction provide further concrete evidence for the claim that the expressive power of constraints and the ease with which they can be incorporated into suitably designed generative processes makes them a powerful tool for producing reliably-controllable generators for game content.},

Auto-dynamic difficulty, however, is a technique for adjusting gameplay to better suit player needs and expectations that holds promise to overcome this problem. This paper presents an experimental testbed to enable auto-dynamic difficulty adjustment does this testbed environment provide for conducting user studies to investigate the factors involved in auto-dynamic difficulty, but this testbed also provides support for developers to build new algorithms in games. Not only facilities and technologies that use auto-dynamic difficulty adjustment to improve gameplay. Initial experiences in using this auto- dynamic difficulty testbed have been quite promising, and have demonstrated its suitability for the task at hand.},

abstract = {By capturing statistical patterns in large corpora, machine learning has enabled significant advances in natural language processing, including in machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, for agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical patterns is insufficient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a defined vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of non-verbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable.},

@article{Chatterjee2018,
abstract = {A fundamental algorithmic problem at the heart of static analysis is Dyck reachability. The input is a graph where the edges are labeled with different types of opening and closing parentheses, and the reachability information is computed via paths whose parentheses are properly matched. We present new results for Dyck reachability problems with applications to alias analysis and data-dependence analysis. Our main contributions, that include improved upper bounds as well as lower bounds that establish optimality guarantees, are as follows: First, we consider Dyck reachability on bidirected graphs, which is the standard way of performing field-sensitive points-to analysis. Given a bidirected graph with n nodes and m edges, we present: (i) an algorithm with worst-case running time O(m + n {\textperiodcentered} $\alpha$(n)), where $\alpha$(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, improving the previously known O(n2) time bound; (ii) a matching lower bound that shows that our algorithm is optimal wrt to worst-case complexity; and (iii) an optimal average-case upper bound of O(m) time, improving the previously known O(m {\textperiodcentered} logn) bound. Second, we consider the problem of context-sensitive data-dependence analysis, where the task is to obtain analysis summaries of library code in the presence of callbacks. Our algorithm preprocesses libraries in almost linear time, after which the contribution of the library in the complexity of the client analysis is only linear, and only wrt the number of call sites. Third, we prove that combinatorial algorithms for Dyck reachability on general graphs with truly sub-cubic bounds cannot be obtained without obtaining sub-cubic combinatorial algorithms for Boolean Matrix Multiplication, which is a long-standing open problem. Thus we establish that the existing combinatorial algorithms for Dyck reachability are (conditionally) optimal for general graphs. We also show that the same hardness holds for graphs of constant treewidth. Finally, we provide a prototype implementation of our algorithms for both alias analysis and data-dependence analysis. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new algorithms significantly outperform all existing methods on the two problems, over real-world benchmarks.},

abstract = {Inthe traditional character-based arts of film, books, animation, or theater, theaudience is presentedwith vivid, powerful, personality-rich characters such asRick fromCasablanca or theGenie or FlyingCarpet fromWaltDisneys Aladdin. Unless one can afford a troop of improvisational actors (and not even then for characters such as the Flying Carpet), one is only able to watch these rich characters. Believable agents allow people to not just watch, but also interact with such powerful, personality-rich characters. Believable agents are a combination of autonomous agents and believable characters from the traditional character-based arts, such as animation, film or literature. They are accurately described both as autonomous agents with the same powerful properties as characters from the arts, and as computer-based, interactive versions of personality-rich characters. Believable agents could be powerfully used for art, entertainment, as part of interactive story systems, social user interfaces, or teaching systems. This dissertation presents my progress toward the creation of believable agents. The first result of this dissertation is a study of the problem to be solved. This study has two parts: a study of believability in traditional character-based arts, and a study of believability for agents, primarily drawing on experience in multiple attempts to construct such agents. The second result of the dissertation is an architecture calledHap specifically designed to support the requirements and expression of believable agents. This support includes a formal language for the detailed expression of an artistically-chosen personality, automatic control of real-time interactive animation, and architectural support for many of the require- ments of believable agents. The architecture is also a unified architecture for the agent in that all aspects of an agents mind are expressed directly in Hap. By doing this the other aspects, such as arbitrary computation, computation of emotions, and recognizing patterns of activity over time for higher-level sensing, all inherit Haps properties for believability. The third result of this thesis is an approach for natural language generation for believable agents. This result includes an analysis of the requirements for natural language in believable agents, an architecture for supporting these requirements, and an example grammar and behaviors that use this architecture as part of an agents behavior. A number of agents have been built using this framework. One is described in detail to show how the technologies described in the dissertation can be used together to build complete believable agents. A public exhibit of some of the constructed agents provides evidence that this approach can achieve a certain level of believability, and that others can learn the framework and use it to build believable agents.},

It assumes some mathematical background on the part of the reader, but the chapters typically begin with a non-mathematical account of the key issues. Current research topics are covered only to the extent that they are informing current applications; detailed coverage of longer term research and more theoretical treatments should be sought elsewhere. There are many pointers at the ends of the chapters that the reader can follow to explore the literature. However, the book does maintain a strong emphasis on evaluation in every chapter both in terms of methodology and the results of controlled experimentation.},

abstract = {This dissertation is motivated by the need, in today's globalist world, for a precise way to enable governments, organisations and other regulatory bodies to evaluate the constraints they place on themselves and others. An organisation's modus operandi is enacting and fulfilling contracts between itself and its participants. Yet, organisational contracts should respect external laws, such as those setting out data privacy rights and liberties. Contracts can only be enacted by following contract law processes, which often require bilateral agreement and consideration. Governments need to legislate whilst understanding today's context of national and international governance hierarchy where law makers shun isolationism and seek to influence one another. Governments should avoid punishment by respecting constraints from international treaties and human rights charters. Governments can only enact legislation by following their own, pre-existing, law making procedures. In other words, institutions, such as laws and contracts are designed and enacted under constraints.},

abstract = {The United States incarcerates over 2 million people annually, but an even larger num- ber of individuals are affected by the criminal justice system as family members of the incarcerated. In this paper, we provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of the effects of incarceration on prisoners' children and siblings in the United States. We leverage the random assignment of cases to judges in Ohio as a source of exogenous variation in in- carceration, and use linked administrative data to measure outcomes for family members. In contrast to most existing work, we find that incarceration reduces criminal involve- ment among the children and siblings of prisoners. Parental incarceration decreases the likelihood of juvenile incarceration by 2.3 percentage points (45 percent) and adult in- carceration by 2.6 percentage points (29 percent), with similar estimates for the effect of sibling incarceration. The reductions are concentrated among children from poorer neighborhoods and those who experience maternal rather than paternal incarceration. At the same time, parental incarceration increases rates of teen parenthood and reduces high school graduation rates. We show that these effects are most consistent with expo- sure to incarceration having a specific deterrent effect on child criminal activity, although the stresses associated with parental incarceration simultaneously harm children in other domains. ∗We},

@article{Sidner1986,
abstract = {In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse. In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interre- lated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a struc- ture of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state). The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utter- ances naturally aggregate. The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them. The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds. The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse. The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses. Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored. This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse. Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and track- ing the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state. This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain.},

Our model builds upon three concepts from the Annales—mentalities, levels of time, and critical events—to explore how critical events affect different dimensions of institutional logics and exert short- or long-range influences. On these bases, organizations make choices, from decoupling to radical shifts in logics, leading to severe institutional changes that become the matter of history. As much as organizations are influenced by events and the prevalent institutional logics, their choices trigger macro-level changes in a recursive manner. More broadly, we comment on how fruitful is our approach to historicize organization studies.},

abstract = {All software evolves, and programming languages and programming language tools are no exception. And just like in ordinary software construction, modular implementations can help ease the process of changing a language implementation and its dependent tools. However, the syntactic and semantic dependencies between language features make this a challenging problem. In this paper we detail how programming languages can be implemented in a modular fashion using the Rascal meta-programming language. Rascal supports extensible definition of concrete syntax, abstract syntax and operations on concrete and abstract syntax trees like matching, traversal and transformation. As a result, new language features can be added without having to change existing code. As a case study, we detail our solution of the LDTA'11 Tool Challenge: a modular implementation of Oberon-0, a relatively simple imperative programming language. The approach we sketch can be applied equally well to the implementation of domain-specific languages.},

abstract = {Interactive storytelling weaves together deep computational ideas with humanity's rich history of story and play, providing an important context for tools and languages to be built. At the same time, formal speciﬁcation languages offer a palette of representation and inference techniquestypically reserved for the analysis of programming languages and complex deductive systems. This thesis connects problems in the interactive storytelling domain to solutions in formal speciﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we examine narrative from a structural point of view and observe that alternative narrative paths play a complementary role to simultaneous interacting timelines. Linear logic provides the representational tools necessary to investigate this structure,and by extending the correspondence to proofs and proof construction, we ﬁnd a suite of computational possibilities. We present three efforts toward realizing those possibilities: (1) the use of linear logic programming to generate narratives; (2) a new programming language for authoring interactive narratives, games, and simulations; and (3) techniques for stating and proving design-level program properties. We ﬁnd that linear logic programming, enriched with a minimal extension to its logical semantics, enables a wide range of programming idioms and domain encodings. Asevidence,we give ﬁve case studies,including social simulation, combat-based adventure games, and board games. To support reasoning about design correctness, we present techniques for stating and proving program in variants, as well as a decidability proof for automatically checking those invariants for a large fragment of the language. These ﬁndings show that linear logic is a fruitful representation language to serve as the basis for modeling and executing interactive worlds, and they invite future investigations on using proof-theoretic methodologies for creative systems.},

In DUS the definition of logical validity of obligations is not based on static truth values but on dynamic action transitions. In this paper prescriptive defeasible obligations are formalized in update semantics and the diagnostic problem of defeasible deontic logic is discussed. Assume a defeasible obligation `normally A ought to be (done)' together with the fact `A is not (done).' Is this an exception of the normality claim, or is it a violation of the obligation? In this paper we formalize the heuristic principle that it is a violation, unless there is a more specific overriding obligation. The underlying motivation from legal reasoning is that criminals should have as little opportunities as possible to excuse themselves by claiming that their behavior was exceptional rather than criminal.},

The agents under study are supersoft agents: autonomous artificial agents programmed to represent and evaluate vague and imprecise information. Agents are further assumed to act in accordance with advice obtained from a normative decision module, with which they can communicate. Norms act as global constraints on the evaluations performed in the decision module and hence no action that violates a norm will be suggested to any agent. Further constraints on action may then be added locally. The method strives to characterise real-time decision making in agents, in the presence of risk and uncertainty.},

abstract = {This article examines the informational exchanges between consumers, food activists and small-scale food producers and vendors through the lenses of justice and literacy. Employing participant observations and interviews at food-related events in South Florida, the article offers two contributions to the growing research on food systems: (1) small-scale food producers, farmworkers, vendors and activists are working an additional shift as citizen educators; and (2) farmworker justice and climate change remain neglected and disconnected from food-related concerns. This article argues that consumers, producers and vendors share an interest and a passion for good-tasting, healthy food that starts a conversation. Yet together they minimize or avoid the politicized nature of climate change and the moral problem of farmworker exploitation. Furthermore, the scientifically complex subject of genetic engineering emerged as a concern and point of activism during the course of this research. Together, climate change, labor and genetic engineering remain difficult topics to bring into conversations and into the food community's educational efforts due to the political, moral and scientifically challenging nature of each concern respectively. This work suggests that citizens as consumers would be empowered by a more complete understanding of the food system, including (1) molecular-level changes due to biotechnology; (2) workplace injustices in the fields; and (3) the links between agriculture and climate change—what this article refers to as food system literacy. The absence of food system literacy is a social problem that masks structural inequities and long-term risks, and that discourages or disables identification and discussion of some of the more complicated issues related to the food chain.},

Traditionally, the vulnerability of coastal communities has been measured either on a micro (community) or a macro (regional) scale. We present research that suggests vulnerability assessments need to be conducted on both micro and a macro scales to more fully address many of the components that contribute to localized community vulnerability. Research presented in this chapter utilizes a GIS methodologically heavy case study of Sarasota County, Florida, in conjunction with an extended version of a vulnerability framework developed by F{\"{u}}ssel (2007) to consider traditional components of vulnerability at both the micro and macro scales. This is accomplished through the theoretical concept of geospatially dependent vulnerability where it is demonstrated that local community vulnerability is multi-scalar and thus must be measured at multiple geographic scales to provide a vulnerability analysis sufficiently robust to adequately aid communities in hazard mitigation and resilience enhancement.},

abstract = {In this paper a theory of delegation is presented. There are at least three reasons for developing such a theory. First, one of the most relevant notions of “agent” is based on the notion of “task” and of “on behalf of”. In order to found this notion a theory of delegation among agents is needed. Second, the notion of autonomy should be based on different kinds and levels of delegation. Third, the entire theory of cooperation and collaboration requires the definition of the two complementary attitudes of goal delegation and adoption linking collaborating agents. After motivating the necessity for a principled theory of delegation (and adoption) the paper presents a plan-based approach to this theory. We analyze several dimensions of the delegation/adoption (on the basis of the interaction between the agents, of the specification of the task, of the possibility to subdelegate, of the delegation of the control, of the help levels). The agent's autonomy and levels of agency are then deduced. We describe the modelling of the client from the contractor's point of view and vice versa, with their differences, and the notion of trust that directly derives from this modelling. Finally, a series of possible conflicts between client and contractor are considered: in particular collaborative conflicts, which stem from the contractor's intention to help the client beyond its request or delegation and to exploit its own knowledge and intelligence (reasoning, problem solving, planning, and decision skills) for the client itself.},

Computer games have been considered textquotedbllefta series of interesting choicestextquotedblright . Is it possible to think of games as moral objects? Or, more precisely: is the design of computer games morally accountable? Computer game design is the craft of gameplay, the challenge of creating a balanced and enjoyable game. In a way, computer game design is the art of creating interesting, entertaining choices. What are the ethics this activity imprints in computer games? What are the ethics of game design? This paper will argue for the analysis of computer games as moral objects because of the ethical values that can be imprinted in their design. Understanding the importance of design as a creative ethical activity, will allow the analysis of computer gamestextquoteright rethorics and the ways they are or could be used for conveying engaging ethical experiences. Understanding the morality of the digital expression can show us both the ways for new expressions, and the moral being of computer game as a form of art.},

abstract = {“Player modeling” is a loose concept. It can equally apply to everything from a predictive model of player actions resulting from machine learning to a designer's description of a player's expected reactions in response to some piece of game content. This lack of a precise terminology prevents practitioners from quickly finding introductions to applicable modeling methods or determining viable alternatives to their own techniques. We introduce a vocabulary that distinguishes between the major existing player modeling applications and techniques. Four facets together define the kind for a model: the scope of application, the purpose of use, the domain of modeled details, and the source of a model's derivation or motivation. This vocabulary allows the identification of relevant player modeling methods for particular problems and clarifies the roles that a player model can take.},

Pro-active satisfaction of information needs across intra-organizational boundaries requires dynamic negotiation of shared understanding and adaptive handling of changing and ad-hoc task contexts. In this paper, we present the notion of a Distributed Organizational Memory (DOM) as a meta-information system with multiple ontology-based structures and a workflow-based context representation. We argue that agent technology offers the software basis which is necessary to realize DOM systems. We sketch a comprehensive Framework for Distributed Organizational Memories which enables the implementation of scalable DOM solutions and supports the principles of agent-mediated knowledge management.},

abstract = {Abstract  This article introduces a new theory of intention representation which is based on a structure called a Dynamic Intention Structure (DIS). The theory of DISs was motivated by the problem of how to properly represent incompletely specified intentions and their evolution. Since the plans and intentions of collaborating agents are most often elaborated incrementally and jointly, elaboration processes naturally involve agreements among agents on the identity of appropriate agents, objects and properties that figure into their joint plans. The paper builds on ideas from dynamic logic to present a solution to the representation and evolution of agent intentions involving reference to incompletely specified and, possibly, mutually dependent intentions, as well as the objects referenced within those intentions. It provides a first order semantics for the resulting logic. A companion paper extends further the logical form of DISs and explores the problem of logical consequence and intention revision.},

This article reviews the problems with this practice, including near universal misinterpretation of p as the probability that H₀ is false, the misinterpretation that its complement is the probability of successful replication, and the mistaken assumption that if one rejects H₀ one thereby affirms the theory that led to the test. Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested. For generalization, psychologists must finally rely, as has been done in all the older sciences, on replication.},

@article{Goldstein2015,
abstract = {This article presents Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

abstract = {Do we think that a problem persists even when it has become less frequent? Levari et al. show experimentally that when the “signal” a person is searching for becomes rare, the person naturally responds by broadening his or her definition of the signal—and therefore continues to find it even when it is not there. From low-level perception of color to higher-level judgments of ethics, there is a robust tendency for perceptual and judgmental standards to “creep” when they ought not to. For example, when blue dots become rare, participants start calling purple dots blue, and when threatening faces become rare, participants start calling neutral faces threatening. This phenomenon has broad implications that may help explain why people whose job is to find and eliminate problems in the world often cannot tell when their work is done. Science , this issue p.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) do not have celiac disease but their symptoms improve when they are placed on gluten-free diets. We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS. Methods We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 y, 6 men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria), but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a 2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey (16 g/d), or control (no additional protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales. Results In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein. Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8{\%} of participants. There were no diet-specific changes in any biomarker. During the 3-day rechallenge, participants' symptoms increased by similar levels among groups. Gluten-specific gastrointestinal effects were not reproduced. An order effect was observed. Conclusions In a placebo-controlled, cross-over rechallenge study, we found no evidence of specific or dose-dependent effects of gluten in patients with NCGS placed diets low in FODMAPs. www.anzctr.org.au.

Ceptre can be viewed as an explication of a new methodology for understanding games based on linear logic, a formal logic concerned with resource usage.We present a correspondence between gameplay and proof search in linear logic, building on prior work on gen- erating narratives. In Ceptre, we introduce the ability to add interactivity selectively into a generative model, en- abling inspection of intermediate states for debugging and exploration as well as a means of play. We claim that this methodology can support game de- signers and researchers in designing, anaylzing, and de- bugging the core systems of their work in generative, multi-agent gameplay. To support this claim, we pro- vide two case studies implemented in Ceptre, one from interactive narrative and one from a strategy-like do- main. Introduction},

abstract = {Existing communication utilities, such as the ISO/OSI model and the associated automation pyramid, have limitations regarding the increased complexity of modern automation systems. The introduction of profiles for fieldbus systems, or field-area networks (FANs), was an important innovation. However, in the foreseeable future the number of FAN nodes in building automation systems is expected to increase drastically. And here the authors see an opportunity to revolutionize the operation of intelligent, autonomous systems based on FANs. The paper introduces a system based on bionic principles to process the information obtained from a large number of diverse sensors. By means of multilevel symbolization, the amount of information to be processed is substantially reduced. A symbolic processing model is introduced that enables the processing of real world information, creates a world representation, and evaluates scenarios that occur in this representation. Two applications involving human actions in a building automation environment are briefly discussed. It is argued that the use of internal symbolization leads to greater flexibility in the case of a large number of sensors, providing the ability to adapt to changing sensor inputs in an intelligent way.},

abstract = {This paper investigates issues related to the use of mobile phones by people aged 60 years and over and characteristics of an ageing-friendly mobile phone. This study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods of Delphi interviews, focus group discussions, and online survey. The expert interviews and the focus group discussions covered usage patterns, problems, benefits, and desired and unwanted features. The issues raised in the discussions were translated into an online survey of 100 people. This study revealed that older people are passive users of mobile phones, that they experience fear of consequences of using unfamiliar technology, and that most preferred design features are aids for declining functional abilities. Gender differences in preferred design features were observed, with women focusing on haptic aids and men on perceptual aids. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Guvenen2018,
abstract = {This paper studies the quantitative implications of wealth taxation (as opposed to capital income taxation) in an incomplete markets model with return rate heterogeneity across individuals. The rate of return heterogeneity arises from the fact that some individuals have better entrepreneurial skills than others, allowing them to obtain a higher return on their wealth. With such heterogeneity, capital income and wealth taxes have different efficiency and distributional implications. Under capital income taxation, entrepreneurs who are more productive and, as a result, generate more income pay higher taxes. Under wealth taxation, on the other hand, entrepreneurs who have similar wealth levels pay similar taxes regardless of their productivity. Thus, in this environment, the tax burden shifts from productive entrepreneurs to unproductive ones if the capital income tax were replaced with a wealth tax. This reallocation increases aggregate productivity. Second, and at the same time, it increases wealth inequality in the population. To provide a quantitative assessment of these different effects, we build and simulate an overlapping generations model with individual-specific returns on capital income and with idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Our results indicate that switching from a capital income tax to a wealth tax increases welfare by almost 8{\%} through better allocation of capital. We also study optimal taxation in this environment and find that, relative to the benchmark, the optimal wealth tax increases welfare by 9.6{\%} while the optimal capital income tax increases it by 6.3{\%}.},

Articulating aesthetic concerns with sociohistorical commentary, Boullata traces the complex, fractured pathways of Palestinian art from the rise of Arab modernism and nationalism during the dying days of Ottoman rule in the latter half of the twentieth century, through successive occupations under the British Mandate and Israel, to the diasporas created by the Nakba of 1948. Jerusalem and Beirut emerge as once thriving cosmopolitan cities, whose modernism was advanced by the mutual influences of Christian and Islamic traditions, and to which women artists continue to make a significant contribution.},

An evaluation of previous research in fan studies revealed four essential issues underlying fan-producer interaction. These four issues led to the study's four research questions, which centered on fan perceptions of ownership of a text, construction of status-relationship between fans and producers, construction of status-relationship among fans, and how fans envisioned their labor contribution to the game development process. Research questions were addressed using a discourse analysis of the forum interactions of fans of the digital-game series Fallout. The investigation focused on fan and producer interaction surrounding the release of the controversial next installment in the Fallout series, Fallout 3. Using previous literature and data gathered, the study proposed a model for fan-producer negotiation over text integrity that can be applied to fan-producer interaction in multiple contexts.},

abstract = {The dissertation is a feasibility study for an interactive fantasy system that enables a human user to participate as a character in a real-time, interactive drama. Such a system must have the ability to understand the words, actions, and goals of the user-character and to formulate and enact a dramatically interesting plot. The study applies the principles of Aristotelian dramatic theory to interactive structure. Dramatic theory provides the system's end cause, the formal and structural qualities of its output, and the organizing principles for its design. Major emphasis is placed on the dramatic theory and techniques that must be embodied in the systems as a whole, and in its playwriting expertise in particular. A crucial distinction between narrative literature and drama is the way in which each is experienced: narrative literature is intended to be read, while drama is intended to be enacted. Dramatic enactment directly involves the visual and auditory senses as well as the mind; accordingly, an interactive drama must unfold in several modalities. Diverse technologies may be employed, including speech recognition, non-verbal sensing techniques, natural-language processing, expert systems, voice synthesis, digital sound production, and "intelligent" computer animation. The capabilities and limitations of various component technologies are examined and a system design is proposed that orchestrates their performance to achieve the desired end. The study develops the theoretical basis for an interactive fantasy system, identifies its functional requirements, proposes a structural model for the system as a whole, and explores in depth the design of a "playwriting expert" that operates as the central intelligence of the system. The study demonstrates that an interactive fantasy system is feasible in terms of both dramatic theory and technology. The potential uses of such a system are explored, including applications in research, entertainment, and learning.},

abstract = {The social sciences investigate human and social dynamics and organization at all levels of analysis (consilience), including cognition, decision making, behavior, groups, organizations, societies, and the world system. Computational social science is the integrated, interdisciplinary pursuit of social inquiry with emphasis on information processing and through the medium of advanced computation. Themain computational social science areas are automated information extraction systems, social network analysis, social geographic information systems (GIS), complexity modeling, and social simulationmodels. Just like Galileo exploited the telescope as the key instrument for observing and gaining a deeper and empirically truthful understanding of the physical universe, computational social scientists are learning to exploit the advanced and increasingly powerful instruments of computation to see beyond the visible spectrum of more traditional disciplinary analyses.},

abstract = {Activation of dopaminergic (DA) transmission by psychostimulants increases c-fos expression. d-Amphetamine-induced c-fos activation is reduced in the neostriatum deprived of DA afferents. Dopaminergic grafts implanted into the denervated neostriatum induce a c-fos hyperexpression when challenged with d-amphetamine, which is correlated with the exaggerated compensation of d-amphetamine-induced rotation. The aim of the present study was to test the generality of this phenomenon and the effects of DA grafts on the expression of three immediate early gene-coded proteins (c-Fos, Jun-B, Krox-24) following a challenge with either d-amphetamine or cocaine. c-fos basal expression was low in the neostriatum and was increased by the administration of psychostimulants. These effects were blocked by the DA lesion and restored by the DA grafts. A c-fos hyperexpression was observed within the grafted neostriatum, which was correlated with the compensation of d-amphetamine- or cocaine-induced rotation. Basal levels of Jun-B- and Krox-24-LI nuclei were high within the neostriatum. Administration of d-amphetamine or cocaine did not influence the expression of these IEG-coded proteins. Jun-B expression was not affected by the surgical procedure. In contrast, lesion of DA afferents of neostriatum decreased Krox-24 basal expression, an effect reversed by the grafts. Thus, the expression of c-fos but not Jun-B or Krox-24 appeared to be a good marker for the rotational behavior exhibited by DA-grafted rats challenged with drugs that increased DA transmission. This generalized c-fos overshoot indicates an abnormal activation of postsynaptic neurons by dopamine and points to its value as an indicator of the deleterious effects of DA grafts.},

abstract = {Open world games present players with more freedom than games with linear progression structures. However, without clearly-defined objectives, they often leave players without a sense of purpose. Most of the time, quests and objectives are hand-authored and overlaid atop an open world's mechanics. But what if they could be generated organically from the gameplay itself? The goal of our project was to develop a model of the mechanics in Minecraft that could be used to determine the ideal placement of objectives in an open world setting. We formalized the game logic of Minecraft in terms of logical rules that can be manipulated in two ways: they may be executed to generate graphs representative of the player experience when playing an open world game with little developer direction; and they may be statically analyzed to determine dependency orderings, feedback loops, and bottlenecks. These analyses may then be used to place achievements on gameplay actions algorithmically.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of stereotypies in children with a history of early institutional care, evaluate the efficacy of a foster care intervention compared with institutional care on the course of stereotypies, and describe correlates in language, cognition, and anxiety for children who exhibit stereotypies.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.

SETTING: Institutions in Bucharest, Romania.

PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-six children with a history of early institutional care. Intervention Comparison of a foster care intervention with continued care as usual in an institution.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of stereotypies as well as outcomes in language, cognition, and anxiety.

RESULTS: At the baseline assessment prior to placement in foster care (average age of 22 months), more than 60{\%} of children in institutional care exhibited stereotypies. Follow-up assessments at 30 months, 42 months, and 54 months indicated that being placed in families significantly reduced stereotypies, and with earlier and longer placements, reductions became larger. For children in the foster care group, but not in the care as usual group, stereotypies were significantly associated with lower outcomes on measures of language and cognition.

CONCLUSIONS: Stereotypies are prevalent in children with a history of institutional care. A foster care intervention appears to have a beneficial/moderating role on reducing stereotypies, underscoring the need for early placement in home-based care for abandoned children. Children who continue to exhibit stereotypies after foster care placement are significantly more impaired on outcomes of language and cognition than children without stereotypies and thus may be a target for further assessments or interventions.},

abstract = {By using current fascination with the science of nutrition in many Western cultures, Food, Morals and Meaning will examine our need to discipline our desires, our appetites and our pleasures at the table. It will be argued that, as well as providing a scientific rationale for eating, nutrition forms the moral basis of modern food choice, requiring us to rationalise our food pleasures. Food, Morals and Meaning first explores the way that concerns about food, the body and pleasure were prefigured in antiquity and then how these concerns were recast in early Christianity as problems of 'natural' appetite which had to be curbed. The following chapters discuss how scientific knowledge about food was constructed out of philosophical and religious concerns about indulgence and excess in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century Europe. By analysing current strategies to promote healthy diets, the book provides an original insight into the construction of social categories like 'good eaters', 'responsible parents' and 'healthy children'. Finally, by using research collected from in-depth interviews with families, the last section focuses on the social organisation of food in the modern home to illustrate the ways that the meal table now incorporates the principles of nutrition as a form of moral training, especially for children. Food, Morals and Meaning will be essential reading for those studying nutrition, public health, sociology of health and illness and sociology of the body.},

@book{RoutledgeHistoryofPhilosophyed.byC.L.Ten1994,
abstract = {The nineteenth century was a period of intense intellectual activity with advances being made in the sciences, in mathematics and in psychology which gradually established itself as a discipline independent of philosophy. Philosophical disputes arose about the nature of scientific method and about whether, or to what extent, the understanding of human conduct and human society required the adoption of the methods of observation and experiment common to the natural sciences. Different philosophical theories about the nature of reality, the foundations of knowledge and of morality, and the limits of individual freedom were systematically developed, and many such theories are still very much alive in contemporary philosophical debates. The philosophers discussed in this volume include those belonging both to the 'analytic' and the 'continental' traditions, as well as the now influential American pragmatists. Each chapter is written by a different author who presents the issues in the context of the period in which they arose, while also keeping an eye on their relevance to current philosophical interests. A few philosophers are discussed in more than one chapter, in different but mutually illuminating contexts. Each chapter in The Nineteenth Century is self-contained and makes a distinctive contribution to a set of philosophical problems.

abstract = {Element distribution in the bark of two 20-year-old clones of Picea sitchensis following wounding was studied using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Bark was sampled at 0, 3, and 43 days after wounding and analysed using a focused Nd:YAG laser (266 nm). Intensities of (13) C, (25)Mg, (27)Al, (31)P, (32)S, (39)K, (48)Ca, (55)Mn, (57)Fe, (63)Cu and (64)Zn were measured by ICP-MS to study elemental distribution across the bark samples during the wound repair process. A clear accumulation of Mg, P and K at the boundary zone between the lesion and healthy tissue was detected in the wounded samples and was more distinctive at 43 than at 3 days after treatment. This zone of accumulation mapped onto the position of formation of the ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiation of the wound periderm. These accumulations suggest major roles for Mg, P and K in the non-specific response of Sitka spruce both to wounding, possibly as co-factors to enzymes and energy utilisation. The LA-ICP-MS method developed in this work proved useful to study spatial element distribution across bark samples and has great potential for applications in other areas of plant pathology research.},

We work with a corpus of implicit relations present in newspaper text and report results on a test set that is representative of the naturally occurring distribution of senses. We use several linguistically informed features, including polarity tags, Levin verb classes, length of verb phrases, modality, context, and lexical features. In addition, we revisit past approaches using lexical pairs from unannotated text as features, explain some of their shortcomings and propose modifications. Our best combination of features outperforms the baseline from data intensive approaches by 4{\%} for comparison and 16{\%} for contingency.},

@article{Roberts2015,
abstract = {Communication systems are exposed to two different pressures: a pressure for transmission efficiency, such that messages are simple to produce and perceive, and a pressure for referential efficiency, such that messages are easy to understand with their intended meaning. A solution to the first pressure is combinatoriality - the recombination of a few basic meaningless forms to express an infinite number of meanings. A solution to the second is iconicity - the use of forms that resemble what they refer to. These two solutions appear to be incompatible with each other, as iconic forms are ill-suited for use as meaningless combinatorial units. Furthermore, in the early stages of a communication system, when basic referential forms are in the process of being established, the pressure for referential efficiency is likely to be particularly strong, which may lead it to trump the pressure for transmission efficiency. This means that, where iconicity is available as a strategy, it is likely to impede the emergence of combinatoriality. Although this hypothesis seems consistent with some observations of natural language, it was unclear until recently how it could be soundly tested. This has changed thanks to the development of a line of research, known as Experimental Semiotics, in which participants construct novel communication systems in the laboratory using an unfamiliar medium. We conducted an Experimental Semiotic study in which we manipulated the opportunity for iconicity by varying the kind of referents to be communicated, while keeping the communication medium constant. We then measured the combinatoriality and transmission efficiency of the communication systems. We found that, where iconicity was available, it provided scaffolding for the construction of communication systems and was overwhelmingly adopted. Where it was not available, however, the resulting communication systems were more combinatorial and their forms more efficient to produce. This study enriches our understanding of the fundamental design principles of human communication and contributes tools to enrich it further.},

The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments. A completely codelet-based system “Core” has been implemented, serving the whole architecture.},

In this paper we present the framework of LISSA which is a serious game designed to teach and learn CPR skills. LISSA combines in a single framework computer-based sim-ulations of CPR emergencies with the functionalities of e-learning platforms. Using UML state machine, different emergency scenario can be derived by instructor and pre-sented as problems that the learner has to solve in a game mode. All the actions and all the cases are registered in a database that can be consulted at any moment by the in-structor. LISSA can be used as a substitute or a complement for traditional CPR classroom-based instruction. It can also be used to educate laypersons who might not otherwise be inclined to attend a CPR course. The adaptive learning sup-ported by LISSA makes it suitable to refresh and improve CPR skill retention over time.},

@article{Jones1996,
abstract = {It is a standard feature of norm-governed institutions that designated agents are empowered to create particular kinds of states of affairs by means of the performance of specified types of actions. Frequently, the states of affairs are of a normative kind, in the sense that they pertain to rights and obligations, as for instance when a Head of Department signs a purchase agreement and thereby creates an obligation on his employer to pay for goods received. We use the term institutionalised power to stand for the notion of power we here seek to explicate. Following a lead from jurisprudential discussions of legal power, we distinguish institutionalised power from permission and practical possibility. We define a conditional connective intended to capture the consequence relation implicit in statements of the form: according to the constraints operative in institutions, the performance of some act A by agent x counts as a means of creating state of affairs B. When combined with deontic and action logics, the new connective facilitates the analysis of a number of notions crucial to the understanding of organised interaction in institutions, such as authoriso.tzon and delegation. We conclude with some illustrations of the expressive power of the new logical language.},

@article{Wang2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Recently proposed techniques have finally made it possible for analysts to interactively explore very large datasets in real time. However powerful, the class of analyses these systems enable is somewhat limited: specifically, one can only quickly obtain plots such as histograms and heatmaps. In this paper, we contribute Gaussian Cubes, which significantly improves on state-of-the-art systems by providing interactive modeling capabilities, which include but are not limited to linear least squares and principal components analysis (PCA). The fundamental insight in Gaussian Cubes is that instead of precomputing counts of many data subsets (as state-of-the-art systems do), Gaussian Cubes precomputes the best multivariate Gaussian for the respective data subsets. As an example, Gaussian Cubes can fit hundreds of models over millions of data points in well under a second, enabling novel types of visual exploration of such large datasets. We present three case studies that highlight the visualization and analysis capabilities in Gaussian Cubes, using earthquake safety simulations, astronomical catalogs, and transportation statistics. The dataset sizes range around one hundred million elements and 5 to 10 dimensions. We present extensive performance results, a discussion of the limitations in Gaussian Cubes, and future research directions.},

Each of the essays is written by one of the world's leading experts in that field. The papers provide a comprehensive introduction to the subject in question, and are written in a way that is accessible to philosophy undergraduates and to those outside of philosophy who are interested in these subjects. Each chapter contains an extensive bibliography of the major writings in the field. Among the topics covered are the philosophy of logic, of mathematics and of Gottlob Frege; Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus; a survey of logical positivism; the philosophy of physics and of science; probability theory, cybernetics and an essay on the mechanist/vitalist debates. In addition to these papers, the volume contains a helpful chronology to the major scientific and philosophical events in the twentieth century. It also provides an extensive glossary of technical terms in the philosophy of science, logic and mathematics, and brief biographical notes on major figures in these fields.},

Surprisingly, the price drops of these bonds are larger than of bonds that were trading in less liquid markets. We argue that this is because institutions fail to internalize the negative effect selling common bonds has on other market participants. After controlling for commonality of bonds, liquid bonds exhibit smaller price impacts in fire sales. Regulatory measures of systemic risk should thus take into account the portfolio overlap in liquid bonds as it exacerbates fire-sale losses.},

abstract = {Topology is the branch of mathematics that tries to understand continuity and continuous functions. You probably don't need to know much topology for your CS degree, but people will bring it up from time to time. For example, you will hear in your category theory class that topological spaces form a category with continuous functions as the arrows. Or you will hear that certain topological spaces are natural models for intuitionistic logic. The goal of these notes is to be the minimal explanation of topology that will enable you to understand those two things. On the real line, continuity is defined in terms of distance: a function from R to R is continuous if points that were sufficiently close together in the domain are mapped to points that are close together in the codomain. The use of “close together” implies a distance function, which in R is simply |x − y|. But what about spaces that are more complex, for which distance doesn't make sense, or where no distance function is apparent? Topology reformulates this idea of “closeness” in terms of special sets called “open sets”.},

We examine some of the ways in which those opposed interests can manifest in a game's design. In particular, we examine those elements of a game's design whose purpose can be argued as questionable and perhaps even unethical. Building upon earlier work in design patterns, we call these abstracted elements Dark Game Design Patterns. In this paper, we develop the concept of dark design patterns in games, present examples of such patterns, explore some of the subtleties involved in identifying them, and provide questions that can be asked to help guide in the specification and identification of future Dark Patterns. Our goal is not to criticize creators but rather to contribute to an ongoing discussion regarding the values in games and the role that designers and creators have in this process.},

abstract = {This thesis consists of a series of extensive projects which aim to explore a new designer role for fashion. It is a role that experiments with how fashion can be reverse engineered, hacked, tuned and shared among many participants as a form of social activism. This social design practice can be called the hacktivism of fashion. It is an engaged and collective process of enablement, creative resistance and DIY practice, where a community share methods and experiences on how to expand action spaces and develop new forms of craftsmanship. In this practice, the designer engages participants to reform fashion from a phenomenon of dictations and anxiety to a collective experience of empowerment, in other words, to make them become fashion-able. As its point of departure, the research takes the practice of hands-on exploration in the DIY upcycling of clothes through “open source” fashion “cookbooks”. By means of hands-on processes, the projects endeavour to create a complementary understanding of the modes of production within the field of fashion design. The artistic research projects have ranged from DIY-kits released at an international fashion week, fashion experiments in galleries, collaborative “hacking” at a shoe factory, engaged design at a rehabilitation centre as well as combined efforts with established fashion brands. Using parallels from hacking, heresy, fan fiction, small change and professional-amateurs, the thesis builds a non-linear framework by which the reader can draw diagonal interpretations through the artistic research projects presented. By means of this alternative reading new understandings may emerge that can expand the action spaces available for fashion design. This approach is not about subverting fashion as much as hacking and tuning it, and making its sub-routines run in new ways, or in other words, bending the current $\backslash$nwhile still keeping the power on.},

Prior to the 2015 Israeli elections, we randomly assigned Palestinian and Israeli financial assets to likely voters, and incentivized them to actively trade for up to seven weeks. No political messages or non-financial information were included. The treatment systematically shifted vote choices towards parties more supportive of the peace process. This effect is not due to a direct material incentive to vote a particular way. Rather, the treatment reduces opposition to concessions for peace, and increases awareness of the broader economic risks of conflict. While participants assigned Palestinian assets are more likely to associate their assets' performance to peace, they are less engaged in the experiment. Combined with the superior performance of Israeli stocks during the study period, the ultimate effects of Israeli and Palestinian assets are similar.},

abstract = {Air power was a contested military strategy during the first half of the 20th century. During World War 2, the doctrine of air power became a dominant part of US national defence contributing to the nationalisation of air space. In this paper I raise parallels between the rise of the doctrine of air power in the US during World War 2 and the concerns about national security following the attacks on September 11, 2001. The visual and spatial logics of air power generate a ‘cosmic view' that unifies and fixes targets from the air. Yet, this articulation of nationalism is challenged by the current practices and conditions of warfare.},

abstract = {Since the advent of computers, the natural and engineering sciences have enormously progressed. Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction 1, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far 210. In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web},

In a storytelling context where the intent is to convey multiple narrative points, a richer set of timeline designs may be more appropriate than the narrow range that has been used for exploratory data analysis by the research community. Informed by a survey of 263 timelines, we present a design space for storytelling with timelines that balances expressiveness and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices characterized by three dimensions: representation, scale, and layout. Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories. Ultimately, this work is intended to inform and inspire the design of future tools for storytelling with timelines},

For a sample of U.S. firms between 1999 and 2013, we find strong support for this strategic complementarity between board independence and the information value of CSR. Our results highlight a novel rationale for CSR – the information motive.},

abstract = {The Internet has become a place of refuge for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular, weblogs are a popular option for personal expression via the Internet. Perhaps this means of communication is well suited to bypassing deficits in social interaction and communication that characterize ASD. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries [10], we compared blogs of individuals with ASD to the writing of neurotypical (NT) bloggers. We found that rates of word usage were nearly identical in the two groups with one exception - there was more variation in the use of social words in ASD compared to NT blogs. This similarity in language between ASD and NT authors suggests that communication deficits routinely found in people with ASD may be due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested, and that the affordances of asynchronous computer-mediated communication may offer alternative means of testing and expression.

@phdthesis{Presented2011,
abstract = {Among the most impressive of aspects of human intelligence is skill acquisition---the ability to identify important behavioral components, retain them as skills, refine them through practice, and apply them in new task contexts. Skill acquisition underlies both our ability to choose to spend time and effort to specialize at particular tasks, and our ability to collect and exploit previous experience to become able to solve harder and harder problems over time with less and less cognitive effort.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nHierarchical reinforcement learning provides a theoretical basis for skill acquisition, including principled methods for learning new skills and deploying them during problem solving. However, existing work focuses largely on small, discrete problems. This dissertation addresses the question of how we scale such methods up to high-dimensional, continuous domains, in order to design robots that are able to acquire skills autonomously. This presents three major challenges; we introduce novel methods addressing each of these challenges.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFirst, how does an agent operating in a continuous environment discover skills? Although the literature contains several methods for skill discovery in discrete environments, it offers none for the general continuous case. We introduce skill chaining, a general skill discovery method for continuous domains. Skill chaining incrementally builds a skill tree that allows an agent to reach a solution state from any of its start states by executing a sequence (or chain) of acquired skills. We empirically demonstrate that skill chaining can improve performance over monolithic policy learning in the Pinball domain, a challenging dynamic and continuous reinforcement learning problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSecond, how do we scale up to high-dimensional state spaces? While learning in relatively small domains is generally feasible, it becomes exponentially harder as the number of state variables grows. We introduce abstraction selection, an efficient algorithm for selecting skill-specific, compact representations from a library of available representations when creating a new skill. Abstraction selection can be combined with skill chaining to solve hard tasks by breaking them up into chains of skills, each defined using an appropriate abstraction. We show that abstraction selection selects an appropriate representation for a new skill using very little sample data, and that this leads to significant performance improvements in the Continuous Playroom, a relatively high-dimensional reinforcement learning problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFinally, how do we obtain good initial policies? The amount of experience required to learn a reasonable policy from scratch in most interesting domains is unrealistic for robots operating in the real world. We introduce CST, an algorithm for rapidly constructing skill trees (with appropriate abstractions) from sample trajectories obtained via human demonstration, a feedback controller, or a planner. We use CST to construct skill trees from human demonstration in the Pinball domain, and to extract a sequence of low-dimensional skills from demonstration trajectories on a mobile robot. The resulting skills can be reliably reproduced using a small number of example trajectories.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFinally, these techniques are applied to build a mobile robot control system for the uBot-5, resulting in a mobile robot that is able to acquire skills autonomously. We demonstrate that this system is able to use skills acquired in one problem to more quickly solve a new problem.},

You might play games like 'Alcoholic' or 'The Frigid Woman' at weekends, or perhaps 'Ain't it awful' or 'Kick me' while you're at work. First published in the 1960s and recognized as a classic work of its kind by professionals, the bestselling "Games People Play" is also an accessible and fascinating read. It is a wise, original, witty and very sensible analysis of the games we play in order to live with one another - and with ourselves.},

This new orientation proposed that formal organizational structure reflected not only technical demands and resource dependencies, but was also shaped by institutional forces, including rational myths, knowledge legitimated through the educational system and by the professions, public opinion, and the law. The core idea that organizations are deeply embedded in social and political environments suggested that organizational practices and structures are often either reflections of or responses to rules, beliefs, and conventions built into the wider environment.},

In this paper, we propose some subclasses of embodied conversational character research and design, with criteria for describing and evaluating research and design advances in each. We suggest that researchers in this field could benefit from carefully identifying their own areas of expertise and contribution, and then looking for ways to collaborate on standards and share advances within these sub- areas. Presenting results, then, would require making clear the sub-areas addressed by the particular project, with evaluations appropriate to those areas included. We believe this approach can help the research community to clarify contributions, and more easily build a common base of knowledge.},

@article{Cheong2015,
abstract = {Games often have storylines. In some games, they are short backstories, serving to set up the action. The first-person shooter game Doom's storyline, about a military science experiment that accidentally opens a portal to hell, is perhaps the canonical example of this kind of story: its main purpose is to set the mood and general theme of the game, and motivate why the player is navigating levels and shooting demons. The level progression and game mechanics have very little to do with the storyline after the game starts. In other games, the storyline structures the progression of the game more pervasively, providing a narrative arc within which the gameplay takes place. The Final Fantasy games are a prominent representative of this style of game storyline. Since the theme of this book is to procedurally generate anything that goes into a game, it will not surprise the reader that we will now look at procedurally gen-erating game storylines. As with procedural generation of game rules, discussed in the previous chapter, procedural generation of storylines is somewhat different from generation of other kinds of procedural content, because storylines are an unusual kind of content. They often intertwine pervasively with gameplay, and their role in a game can depend heavily on a game's genre and mechanics. A common way of integrating a game's storyline with its gameplay, especially in adventure games and role-playing games, is the quest [24, 1]. In a quest, a player is given something to do in the game world, which is usually both motivated by the current state of the storyline, and upon completion will advance it in some way. For example, the player may be tasked with retrieving an item, helping an NPC, defeat-ing a monster, or transporting some goods to another town. Some games (especially RPGs) may be structured as one large quest, broken down into smaller sub-quests that interleave gameplay and story progression. There are several reasons a game designer might want to procedurally generate game stories, beyond the general arguments for procedural content generation dis-cussed in Chapter 1. One reason is that procedurally generated game worlds can lack meaning or motivation to the player, unless they are tied into the game story by procedurally generating relevant parts of story along with the worlds. As Ash-119 120 Yun-Gyung Cheong, Mark O. Riedl, Byung-Chull Bae, Mark J. Nelson more and Nitsche [2] argue, " without context and goals, the generated behaviors, graphics, and game spaces run the danger of becoming insubstantial and tedious " . A second reason is that proceduralizing quests can make them truly playable. Sul-livan et al. [22] note that computer RPGs often have a particularly degenerate form of quest, " generally structured as a list of tasks or milestones " , rather than open-ended goals the player can creatively satisfy. Table-top RPGs have more complex and open-ended quests, since in those games, quests can be dynamically gener-ated and adapted during gameplay by the human game-master, rather than being prewritten. Procedural quest generation gives a way to bring that flexibility back into videogame quests. 7.1 Procedural story generation via planning},

Recently, tagging has grown popular as an alternative means of organizing information resources. We argue that tagging is a powerful paradigm for efficient information access which overcomes many deficiencies of hierarchical file systems, especially in the context of the organization of large quantities of personal files. In this paper we present TagFS, a filesystem with tagging support which aims at a seamless integration of the tagging paradigm with local applications. While retaining the notions of directories and files and providing all standard filesystem operations, the semantics of these primitives are changed to modifications of the tag annotations.},

The complex issue of motivation to learn has been researched but results are inconclusive. How can hedonic and pragmatic qualities contribute to motivation to learn? In this study ARCS model of motivational design (Keller, 1987) and the UX model proposed by Hassenzahl et al. (2003) are employed as we are trying to interpret this complex phenomenon. A model with hedonic and pragmatic factors predicting motivation to learn is presented and discussed. A serious educational game is used and evaluated in elementary school settings as a complementary method to teach geography. Findings reveal that hedonic values are still strong and contribute in much higher degree to motivation to learn even though the purpose of the game is to learn. Understanding such relationships between motivation to learn and user experience perceptions (hedonic and pragmatic ones) may provide valuable input to the design and evaluation of serious games.},

abstract = {In the first decade of the twenty-first century, video games are an integral part of global media culture, rivaling Hollywood in revenue and influence. No longer confined to a subculture of adolescent males, video games today are played by adults around the world. At the same time, video games have become major sites of corporate exploitation and military recruitment.In Games of Empire, Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter offer a radical political critique of such video games and virtual environments as Second Life, World of Warcraft, and Grand Theft Auto, analyzing them as the exemplary media of Empire, the twenty-first-century hypercapitalist complex theorized by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. The authors trace the ascent of virtual gaming, assess its impact on creators and players alike, and delineate the relationships between games and reality, body and avatar, screen and street.Games of Empire forcefully connects video games to real-world concerns about globalization, militarism, and exploitation, from the horrors of African mines and Indian e-waste sites that underlie the entire industry, the role of labor in commercial game development, and the synergy between military simulation software and the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan exemplified by Full Spectrum Warrior to the substantial virtual economies surrounding World of Warcraft, the urban neoliberalism made playable in Grand Theft Auto, and the emergence of an alternative game culture through activist games and open-source game development.Rejecting both moral panic and glib enthusiasm, Games of Empire demonstrates how virtual games crystallize the cultural, political, and economic forces of global capital, while also providing a means of resisting them.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use multiagent technology for social simulation of sociological micro-macro issues in the domain of electronic marketplaces. We argue that allowing self-interested agents to enable social reputation as a mechanism for flexible self-regulation during runtime can improve the robustness and 'social order' of multiagent systems to cope with various perturbations that arise when simulating open markets (e.g. dynamic modifications of task profiles, scaling of agent populations, agent drop-outs, deviant behaviour). Referring to the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu, we provide a multi-level concept of reputation that consists of three different types (image, social esteem, and prestige) and considers reputation as a kind of 'symbolic capital'. Reputation is regarded to be objectified as an observable property and to be incorporated into the agents' mental structures through social practices of communication on different aggregation levels of sociality. We present and analyse selected results of our social simulations and discuss the importance of reputation with regard to the robustness of multiagent simulations of electronic markets. Keyw},

abstract = {After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it.},

abstract = {AbstractDecision-making is primarily a process that involves different actors: people, groups of people, institutions and the state. As a discipline, multi-criteria decision-making has a relatively short history. Since 1950s and 1960s, when foundations of modern multi-criteria decision-making methods have been laid, many researches devoted their time to development of new multi-criteria decision-making models and techniques. In the past decades, researches and development in the field have accelerated and seem to continue growing exponentially. Despite the intensive development worldwide, few attempts have been made to systematically present the theoretical bases and developments of multi-criteria decision-making methods. However, the methodological choices and framework for assessment of decisions are still under discussion. The article describes the situation with reviews of MCDM/MADM methods. Furthermore, there is a need for research to study the strengths and weaknesses of different decision-making me...},

Cambridge University Press, originally published in 1987. With the 2 nd edition of Plans and Situated Actions my aim is to rejoin a discussion in which I first participated over ten years ago, on the question of nonhuman – particularly machine – agency. My renewed interest in questions of agency is inspired by recent developments both in the area of interactive computing and in the debate over human-nonhuman relations within social studies of science and technology. What I propose to do is another attempt at working these two projects together, in what I hope will be a new and useful way. The newness is less a radical shift in where we draw the boundary between persons and machines than a reconsideration of how, on what bases, those boundaries are drawn. The reconsideration is based in critical reflection on my own previous position, in light of what has happened since. What follows are the beginnings of the argument.},

abstract = {Computer games have grown considerably in scale and complexity since their humble beginnings in the 1960s. Modern day computer games have reached incredible levels of realism, especially in areas like graphics, physical simulation, and artificial intelligence. However, despite significant advances in software engineering, the development of computer games generally does not employ state-of-the-art software engineering practices and tools. This thesis describes an architecture for computer games as a System of Systems where the computer game itself is emergent. The proposed architecture follows a data centered framework where the independent components collaborate on a central data store. The architecture offers capabilities that are essential in overcoming challenges faced in building computer games that can enjoy modifiability, expandability, and maintainability traits. The architecture promotes component-based development (e.g., commercial off the shelf components) since the collaborating components have loose couplings, which in turn facilitates systematic design integration of System of Systems.},

Examples include first-order logic, equational logic, Horn-clause logic, higher-order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic. intuitionistic logic, order-sorted logic, and temporal loglc; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic loglcal system. The concept of institution is introduced to formalize the informal notion of {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}logical system. {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} The major requirement is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences that is consistent under change of notation. Institutions enable abstracting away from syntactic and semantic detail when working on language structure {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}in-the-large{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}}; for example, we can define language features for building large structures from smaller ones, possibly involving parameters, without commitment to any particular logical system, This applies to both specification languages and programming languages. Institutions also have applications to such areas as database theory and the semantics of artnlcial and natural languages. A first main result of this paper says that any institution such that signatures (which define notation) can be glued together, also allows gluing together theories (which are just collections of sentences over a fixed signature). A second main result considers when theory structuring is preserved by institution morphisms. A third mam result gwes conditions under which lt M sound to use a theorem prover for one institution on theories from another.

The work presented in this paper investigates individual differences in gameplay and learning during student interactions with a narrative-centered learning environment, Crystal Island. Findings reveal striking differences between high- and low-achieving science students in problem-solving effectiveness, attention to particular gameplay elements, learning gains and engagement ratings. High-achieving science students tended to demonstrate greater problem-solving efficiency, reported higher levels of interest and presence in the narrative environment, and demonstrated an increased focus on information gathering and information organization gameplay activities. Lower-achieving microbiology students gravitated toward novel gameplay elements, such as conversations with non-player characters and the use of laboratory testing equipment. The findings have implications for the design of broadly effective gameplay activities for narrative-centered learning environments, as well as investigations of scaffolding techniques to promote effective problem solving, improved learning outcomes and sustained engagement for all students.},

It specifies global goals of the system independently from those of the specific agents that populate the system. Both the norms that regulate interaction between agents, as well as the contextual meaning of those interactions are important aspects when specifying the organizational structure. Omni integrates all this aspects in one framework. In order to make design of the multi-agent system manageable, we distinguish three levels of abstraction with increasing implementation detail. All dimensions of Omni have a formal logical semantics, which ensures consistency and possibility of verification of the different aspects of the system. Omni is therefore utmost suitable for the modelling of all types of 1.},

People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

In this paper, we argue that existing urban development are already adaptive and incremental. Given this flexibility in urban development, understanding changes in the so-called ‘rules of the game' which structure and change collective action, is increasingly relevant. Gaining such insights advances the ability of planners to deal with perceived spatial problems. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to develop an analytical framework for scrutinizing changes in rules in incremental urban developments and second, to test the analytical framework in a real-life incremental urban development. Building on Ostrom's IAD Framework we develop an analytical framework that makes a distinction between formal and informal rules, connects sets of rules, actors and interaction patterns and provides a comparative, longitudinal perspective. The case of the Navy Yard in Amsterdam, the Netherlands is used in order to test the framework's application, proving the relevance of investigating how rules in urban development change.},

abstract = {Avatars are a commonly used mechanism for representing the player within the world of a game. The avatar forms the main point of interaction between the player and the game, and thus the avatar is an important game design feature. Character-based games combine the concept of an avatar with that of a character, enhancing the avatar with specific features that commonly are changeable, and which can be defined within or outside the framework of the game rules. Within digital games, the rules-based features have received comparatively more attention than, for example, the personalities and background histories of game characters. This article presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of the way complex game characters are utilized by players in multiplayer role-playing games across two different media platforms. The results indicate that adult players are capable of comprehending and utilizing game characters with well-defined personalities and backgrounds, as well as rules-based components. Furthermore, that the game format plays a significant role in the pattern of usage of the character elements. This pattern appears directly linked with variations in the way that the different game formats handle player characters and activate or promote the activation of, different forms of character elements. The degree to which different character elements are activated also has implications for the degree of player engagement in the character.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Research on norms in International Relations (IR) includes various concepts related to how norms influence actions. These approaches focus on the decision-making process, and largely neglect the operationalization of norms. This omission leads to an analytical gap: a lack of attention to how the substance of abstract norms is transformed and constructed in the operationalization process. This article draws on the Foucauldian theme of governmentality to introduce a novel perspective on operationalizing norms. It focusses in particular on the role of techniques as understudied parts inherent to the reflexive processes of operationalization and meaning production. The article thereby contests the prevalence of fundamental norms in conventional IR theory. It demonstrates, instead, that global governance techniques do not simply translate rationalities into practice, but construct their very own normativities. These theoretical reflections are illustrated by analysing the operationalization of norms through indicators in the case of the European Union's human rights policy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {People often think about how things might have happened differently. Their counterfactual thoughts tend to mentally undo the most recent event in an independent sequence. Consider a game in which two players must each pick the same color card, both red or both black. The first picks black and the second picks red and so they lose. People think, "If only the second player had picked black." Our study tested the idea that the ways in which the players could have won provide counterfactual alternatives to the facts. In three experiments, the same set of facts (both players picked black cards), and the same winning conditions (to win in this new game they must pick different color cards) were presented, but the description of the winning conditions varied (e.g., "if one or the other but not both picks a red card" vs. "if one or the other but not both picks a black card"). The results showed that the temporal order effect can be produced or reversed by different descriptions. The descriptions make accessible different elements of the winning possibilities. A theory of the mental representations and cognitive processes underlying counterfactual thinking in the temporal order effect is described.},

@article{Hastings2009,
abstract = {Simulation and game content includes the levels, models, textures, items, and other objects encountered and possessed by players during the game. In most modern video games and in simulation software, the set of content shipped with the product is static and unchanging, or at best, randomized within a narrow set of parameters. However, ideally, if game content could be constantly and automatically renewed, players would remain engaged longer. This paper introduces two novel technologies that take steps toward achieving this ambition: 1) a new algorithm called content-generating NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (cgNEAT) is introduced that automatically generates graphical and game content while the game is played, based on the past preferences of the players, and 2) Galactic Arms Race (GAR), a multiplayer video game, is constructed to demonstrate automatic content generation in a real online gaming platform. In GAR, which is available to the public and playable online, players pilot space ships and fight enemies to acquire unique particle system weapons that are automatically evolved by the cgNEAT algorithm. A study of the behavior and results from over 1000 registered online players shows that cgNEAT indeed enables players to discover a wide variety of appealing content that is not only novel, but also based on and extended from previous content that they preferred in the past. Thus, GAR is the first demonstration of evolutionary content generation in an online multiplayer game. The implication is that with cgNEAT it is now possible to create applications that generate their own content to satisfy users, potentially reducing the cost of content creation and increasing entertainment value from single-player to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) with a constant stream of evolving content.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Science is facing a “replication crisis” in which many experimental findings cannot be replicated and are likely to be false. Does this imply that many scientific facts are false as well? To find out, we explore the process by which a claim becomes fact. We model the community's confidence in a claim as a Markov process with successive published results shifting the degree of belief. Publication bias in favor of positive findings influences the distribution of published results. We find that unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, false claims frequently can become canonized as fact. Data-dredging, p-hacking, and similar behaviors exacerbate the problem. Should negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims would be more readily distinguished. To the degree that the model reflects the real world, there may be serious concerns about the validity of purported facts in some disciplines.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The game of go is an ideal problem domain for exploring machine learning: it is easy to define and there are many human experts, yet existing programs have failed to emulate their level of play to date. Existing literature on go playing programs and applications of machine learning to games are surveyed. An error function based on a database of master games is defined which is used to formulate the learning of go as an optimization problem. A classification technique called pattern preference is presented which is able to automatically derive patterns representative of good moves; a hashing technique allows pattern preference to run efficiently on conventional hardware with graceful degradation as memory size decreases. 1},

In an attempt to gain better understanding of data, fi elds such as information visualization, data mining and graphic design are employed, each solving an isolated part of the specifi c problem, but failing in a broader sense: there are too many unsolved problems in the visualization of complex data. As a solution, this dissertation proposes that the individual fi elds be brought together as part of a singular process titled Computational Information Design. This dissertation fi rst examines the individual pedagogies of design, information, and computation with a focus on how they support one another as parts of a combined methodology for the exploration, analysis, and representation of complex data. Next, in order to make the process accessible to a wider audience, a tool is introduced to simplify the computational process for beginners, and can be used as a sketch- ing platform by more advanced users. Finally, a series of examples show how the methodology and tool can be used to address a range of data problems, in particular, the human genome.},

abstract = {I will first discuss how social interactions organize, coordinate, and specialize as “artifacts,” tools; how these tools are not only for coordination but for achieving something, for some outcome (goal/function), for a collective work. In particular, I will argue that these artifacts specify (predict and prescribe) the mental contents of the participants, both in terms of beliefs and acceptances and in terms of motives and plans. We have to revise the behavioristic view of “scripts” and “roles”; when we play a role we wear a “mind.” No collective action would be possible without shared and/or ascribed mental contents. This is also very crucial for a central form of automatic mind-reading (mind ascription). Second, I will argue that often what really matters is the ascribed/prescribed, worn, mind not the real, private one. We have to play (like in the symbolic play) “as if” we had those mental contents. This social convention and mutual assumption makes the interaction work. The ascribed beliefs and goals are not necessarily explicitly there; they might be just implicit as inactive (we act just by routine and automatically) or implicit as potential. The coordination and social action works thanks to these “as if” (ascribed and pretended) minds, thanks to those conventional constructs. Our social minds for social interactions are coordination artifacts and social institutions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

abstract = {Forgetting is an important tool for reducing ontologies by eliminating some redundant concepts and roles while preserving sound and complete reasoning. Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs), such as DL-Lite and extended . However, the issue of forgetting for ontologies in more expressive DLs, such as and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in , state the properties of forgetting for concept descriptions, and present algorithms for computing the result of forgetting for concept descriptions. Unlike the case of DL-Lite, the result of forgetting for an ontology does not exist in general, even for the special case of forgetting in TBoxes. This makes the problem of computing the result of forgetting in more challenging. We address this problem by defining a series of approximations to the result of forgetting for ontologies and studying their properties. Our algorithms for computing approximations can be directly implemented as a plug-in of an ontology editor to enhance its ability of managing and reasoning in (large) ontologies.},

(We do not cover research relating specifically to other programming styles.) The main focus of the review is on novice programming and topics relating to novice teaching and learning. Various problems experienced by novices are identified, including issues relating to basic program design, to algorithmic complexity in certain language features, to the ‘‘fragility' ' of novice knowledge, and so on. We summarise this material and suggest some practical implications for teachers. We suggest that a key issue that emerges is the distinction between effective and ineffective novices. What characterises effective novices? Is it possible to identify the specific deficits of ineffective novices and help them to become effective learners of programming? 1.},

While both J{\"{u}}rgen Habermas and Michel Foucault have provided strong philosophical impetus for reconceptualizing participation, neither provides a fully satisfying solution to the difficulties of understanding political action in this postmodern world. However combining Habermas's vision of discursive politics with Foucault's focus on the micropolitics of resistance provides the basis for developing a more satisfying conception that defines political participation as performance and its purpose as resistance. Such a performative understanding of political participation not only enriches our understanding of discourse and resistance; it also makes better sense of the variety of political activities prevalent and efficacious today.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have in the past years developed to become a working horse in brain imaging and the computational neurosciences, as they are instrumental for mining vast amounts of neural data of ever increasing measurement precision and detecting minuscule signals from an overwhelming noise floor. They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation. The goal of this review is therefore to provide an accessible and clear introduction to the strengths and also the inherent dangers of machine learning usage in the neurosciences.},

abstract = {We combine georeferenced data on mining extraction of 14 minerals with information on conflict events at spatial resolution of 0.5 o × 0.5 o for all of Africa between 1997 and 2010. Exploiting exogenous variations in world prices, we find a positive impact of mining on conflict at the local level. Quantitatively, our estimates suggest that the historical rise in mineral prices (commodity super-cycle) might explain up to one-fourth of the average level of violence across African countries over the period. We then document how a fighting group's control of a mining area contributes to escalation from local to global violence. Finally, we analyze the impact of corporate practices and transparency initiatives in the mining industry. (JEL C23, D74, L70, O13, Q34) Natural riches such as valuable minerals have often been blamed for fueling armed fighting. A case that recently made headlines is the heavy fighting that broke out between the Rizeigat and Bani Hussein, two Arab tribes, for territorial control of the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur region. The conflict has killed more than},

abstract = {Institutions are linkage mechanisms that bridge across three kinds of social divides - they link micro systems of social interaction to meso (and macro) levels of organization, they connect the symbolic with the material, and the agentic with the structural. Two key analytic principles are identified for empirical research, relationality and duality. These are linked to new research strategies for the study of institutions that draw on network analytic techniques. Two hypotheses are suggested. (1) Institutional resilience is directly correlated to the overall degree of structural linkages that bridge across domains of level, meaning, and agency. (2) Institutional change is related to over-bridging, defined as the sustained juxtaposition of multiple styles within the same institutional site. Case examples are used to test these contentions. Institutional stability is examined in the case of Indian caste systems and American academic science. Institutional change is explored in the case of the rise of the early Christian church and in the origins of rock and roll music.},

abstract = {This well-accepted introduction to computational geometry is a textbook for high-level undergraduate and low-level graduate courses. The focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms. In this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, and realistic input models have been added.},

We present a novel purity system for Java that employs purity annotations which can be checked modularly. This is done using a flow-sensitive, intraprocedural analysis. The system exploits two properties, called freshness and locality , to increase the range of methods that can be considered pure. JPure also includes an inference engine for annotating legacy code. We evaluate our system against several packages from the Java Standard Library. Our results indicate it is possible to uncover significant amounts of purity efficiently.},

abstract = {Real-world applications that are ideal for robotic solutions are very complex and challenging. Many of these applications are set in dynamic environments that require capabilities distributed in functionality, space or time. These applications, therefore, often require teams of robots to work together cooperatively to successfully address the mission. While much research in recent years has addressed the issues of autonomous robots and multi-robot cooperation, current robotics technology is still far from achieving many of these real world applications. We believe that two primary reasons for this technology gap are that (1) previous work has not adequately addressed the issues of fault tolerance and adaptivity in multi-robot teams, and (2) existing robotics research is often geared at specific applications and is not easily generalized to different, but related, applications. This paper addresses these issues by first describing the design issues of key importance in these real-world cooperative robotics...},

abstract = {After arguing about the crucial importance of trust for Agents and MAS, we provide a definition of trust both as a mental state and as a social attitude and relation. We present the mental ingredients of trust: its specific beliefs and goals, with special attention to evaluations and expectations. We show the relation between trust and the mental background of delegation. We explain why trust is a bet, and implies some risks, and analyse the more complex forms of social trust, based on a theory of mind and in particular on morality, reputation and disposition, and authority (three party trust). We explain why promises, contracts, authorities can increase our trust by modifying our mental representations. We present a principled quantification of trust, based on its cognitive ingredients, and use this "degree of trust" as the basis for a rational decision to delegate or not to another agent. We explain when trust is rational, and why it is not an irrational decision by definition. We also criticise the economic and game-theoretic view of trust for underestimating the importance of cognitive ingredients of trust and for reducing it to subjective probability and risk. The paper is intended to contribute both to the conceptual analysis and to the practical use of trust in social theory and MAS.},

Following design principles from proof theory, bidirectional typing can be applied to many type constructs. The principles underlying a bidirectional approach to polymorphism, however, are less obvious. We give a declarative, bidirectional account of higher-rank polymorphism, grounded in proof theory; this calculus enjoys many properties such as eta-reduction and predictability of annotations. We give an algorithm for implementing the declarative system; our algorithm is remarkably simple and well-behaved, despite being both sound and complete.},

Structuration theory, on the other hand, largely remains a process theory of such abstraction that it has generated few empirical studies. This paper discusses the similarities between the two theories, develops an argument for why a fusion of the two would enable institutional theory to significantly advance, develops a model of institutionalization as a structuration process, and proposes methodological guidelines for investigating the process empirically.},

abstract = {Walking has been a long standing source of literary and artistic inspiration for writers (Poe 1840; Wordsworth 1979; Sinclair 2003) political activists (Chtcheglov 1953; Garrett 2013) and artists (Breton 1960; Aragon 1999). The videogames landscape has seen a surge in walking inspired games controversially tagged as 'walking simulators'. This paper is a literary reading into three such tagged games: Year Walk, Gone Home and Dear Esther. It frames these games as continuations of the Romantic tradition of walking as an aesthetic practice thus embracing walking simulators as an art, the like of Romantic paintings and literature. Using the psychogeographic d{\'{e}}rive, it interprets these ludic experiences as an artistic and aesthetic expression with an emphasis on authentic emotion, subjective in play and design. Through the walk, the landscape of the games become tied to the practice of literary psychogeography following a lineage including Charles Dickets (2010), G. K. Chesterton (1905), Andre Breton (1960), Ian Sinclair (2003) and Will Self (2015). It concludes that there might be an appropriateness in using the term 'walking' in defining these games. The Romantic tradition was born out of walking and it is evolving into a digitisation of its practice.},

abstract = {More and more evidence indicates that the 3D conformation of eukaryotic genomes is a critical part of genome function. However, due to the lack of accurate and reliable 3D genome structural data, this information is largely ignored and most of these studies have to use information systems that view the DNA in a linear structure. Visualizing genomes in real time 3D can give researchers more insight, but this is fraught with hardware limitations since each element contains vast amounts of information that cannot be processed on the fly. Using a game engine and sophisticated video game visualization techniques enables us to construct a multi-platform real-time 3D genome viewer. The game engine-based viewer achieves much better rendering speed and can handle much larger amounts of data compared to our previous implementation using OpenGL. Combining this viewer with 3D genome models from experimental data could provide unprecedented opportunities to gain insight into the conformation-function relationships of a genome.},

Recently, an increasing number of researchers have begun to espouse a view of rationality that takes account of organisms' adaptive goals, natural environments, and cognitive constraints. We argue that inference is carried out using boundedly rational heuristics, that is, heuristics that allow organisms to reach their goals under conditions of limited time, information, and computational capacity. These heuristics are ecologically rational in that they exploit aspects of both the physical and social environment in order to make adaptive inferences. We review recent work exploring this multifaceted conception of rationality.},

abstract = {This review article is a compendium of six individual manuscripts, a Commentary, and an Executive Summary. This body of work is entitled "The Impact of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space" and was developed in response to a recommendation from the 2011 National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, "Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences for a New Era," which emphasized the need to fully understand sex and gender differences in space. To ensure the health and safety of male and female astronauts during long-duration space missions, it is imperative to examine and understand the influences that sex and gender have on physiological and psychological changes that occur during spaceflight. In this collection of manuscripts, six workgroups investigated and summarized the current body of published and unpublished human and animal research performed to date related to sex- and gender-based differences in the areas of cardiovascular, immunological, sensorimotor, musculoskeletal, reproductive, and behavioral adaptations to human spaceflight. Each workgroup consisted of scientists and clinicians from academia, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other federal agencies and was co-chaired by one representative from NASA and one from the external scientific community. The workgroups met via telephone and e-mail over 6 months to review literature and data from space- and ground-based studies to identify sex and gender factors affecting crew health. In particular, the Life Sciences Data Archive and the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health were extensively mined. The groups identified certain sex-related differences that impact the risks and the optimal medical care required by space-faring women and men. It represents innovative research in sex and gender-based biology that impacts those individuals that are at the forefront of space exploration.},

This in-creases the expressiveness of conventional record calculi significantly, and we show how we can encode intersec-tion types, closed-world overloading, type case, label selective calculi, and first-class messages. We formally motivate the need for row equality predicates to express type constraints in the presence of polymorphic labels. This naturally leads to an orthogonal treatment of unre-stricted row polymorphism that can be used to express first-class patterns. Based on the theory of qualified types, we present an effective type inference algorithm and efficient compila-tion method. The type inference algorithm, including the discussed extensions, is fully implemented in the experimental Morrow compiler.},

It contains a mixture of state-based manipulations, synchronisation, message passing, and parallel, conditional, and iterative control structures. The formal semantics of a Behavior Tree is given via a translation to a version of Hoare's process algebra CSP, extended with state-based constructs such as guards and updates, and a message passing facility similar to that used in publish/subscribe protocols. We first provide the extension of CSP and its operational semantics, which preserves the meaning of the original CSP operators, and then the Behavior Tree notation and its translation into the extended version of CSP. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Associative browsing represents a common and intuitive set of exploratory strategies in which users step iteratively from familiar to novel bits of information. In this paper, we examine associative browsing as a strategy for bottom-up exploration of large, heterogeneous networks. We present Refinery, an interactive visualization system informed by guidelines for associative browsing drawn from literature on exploratory information-seeking. These guidelines motivate Refinery's query model, which allows users to simply and expressively construct queries using heterogeneous sets of nodes. This system computes degree-of-interest scores for associated content using a fast, random-walk algorithm. Refinery visualizes query nodes within a subgraph of results, providing explanatory context, facilitating serendipitous discovery, and stimulating continued exploration. A study of 12 academic researchers using Refinery to browse publication data demonstrates how the system enables discovery of valuable new content, even within existing areas of expertise.},

One way to generate narrative is to use planning. However, story planners are limited by the fact that they can only operate on the story world provided, which impacts the ability of the planner to find a solution story plan and the quality and structure of the story plan if one is found.

abstract = {Music relies heavily on repetition to build structure and meaning. Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure. The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention, has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important. Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018). This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity is quadratic in the sequence length. We propose an algorithm that reduces the intermediate memory requirements to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate minute-long (thousands of steps) compositions with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies. We evaluate the Transformer with our relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and Piano-e-competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.},

abstract = {As the complexity of modern games increases, there has been a movement away from traditional artificial intelligence (AI) technologi es as developers search for AI that is more scalable, flexible and provides diverse behaviour in non-player characters (NPCs). Recent innovations in the field of AI Planning have seen the first Goal Oriented Action Planner (GOAP) developed for a commercial game. GOAP has been hailed as the next step in evolving AI in games and can offer several adv antages over traditional AI techniques. This dissertation investigated, analysed and compared a traditional AI technique, finite state machines, with Goal Oriented Action Planning when applied in games to discover whether GOAP is indeed an improvement over FSMs and what the relative merits of each system are. As part of the dissertation, a GOAP and FSM system was developed and placed in a game scenario where experiments were carried out between the two. Comparisons were made on three levels, the first was based on the resu lts of the games i.e. how the systems performed against one another in the Domination, Ca pture the Flag, Deathmatch and Last Man Standing game modes. The second comparison examined the two systems from a technical perspective and investigated how each system performed from a memory management, CPU usage and efficiency standpoint. The final comparison considers the merits of the two systems with respect to ease of mana gement, flexibility and re-usability. The results of the experiments clearly high lighted that GOAP is a superior AI system for many reasons however there are certain drawbacks associated with it which may require some consideration before choosing GOAP as a primary AI technique for a commercial game title. No other previous piece of work has ta ken a GOAP system and compared it with another AI technique so the findings of this dissertation add to the limite d pool of knowledge associated with AI planning in games.},

abstract = {Actions that affect knowledge asymmetrically among agents occur in numerous domains, from card games such as poker to the secure transmission of information. Applications in such domains often depend on reflection over knowledge, including what an agent knows about what other agents know. We are interested in enabling formal specification of these systems which may be used for executable prototyping as well as verification and other formal reasoning. Dynamic Epistemic Logic provides a formal basis for such reasoning, but is often prohibitively cumbersome to use in practice. We present an implementation and macro system called Ostari, backed by a particular flavor of Dynamic Epistemic Logic, which allows us to scale the ideas to more realistic problems. We demonstrate how actions that manipulate agents' beliefs can be written concisely and how this capability can be applied to modeling a popular card game by utilizing our system's ability to execute action sequences, answer queries about knowledge states, and find action sequences to satisfy a particular goal.},

abstract = {The decisions of the United States Supreme Court have far-reaching implications in American life. Using transcripts of Supreme Court oral arguments this work looks at the conversational dynamics of Supreme Court justices and links their conversational interaction with the decisions of the Court and individual justices. While several studies have looked at the relationship between oral arguments and case variables, to our knowledge, none have looked at the relationship between conversational dynamics and case outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWorking from this view, we show that the conversation of Supreme Court justices is both predictable and predictive. We aim to show that conversation during Supreme Court cases is patterned, this patterned conversation is associated with case outcomes, and that this association can be used to make predictions about case outcomes. We present three sets of experiments to accomplish this. The first examines the order of speakers during oral arguments as a patterned sequence, showing that cohesive elements in the discourse, along with references to individuals, provide significant improvements over our “bag-of-words” baseline in identifying speakers in sequence within a transcript. The second graphically examines the association between speaker turn-taking and case outcomes. The results presented with this experiment point to interesting and complex relationships between conversational interaction and case variables, such as justices' votes. The third experiment shows that this relationship can be used in the prediction of case outcomes with accuracy ranging from 62.5{\%} to 76.8{\%} for varying conditions. Finally, we offer recommendations for improved tools for legal researchers interested in the relationship between conversation during oral arguments and case outcomes, and suggestions for how these tools may be applied to more general problems.},

abstract = {Most studies of digital media focus on elements familiar from traditional media. For example, studies of digital literature generally focus on surface text and audience experience. Interaction is considered only from the audience's perspective. This study argues that such approaches fail to interpret the element that defines digital media-computational processes. An alternative is proposed here, focused on interpreting the internal operations of works. It is hoped that this will become a complement to (rather than replacement for) previous approaches. The examples considered include both processes developed as general practices and those of specific works. A detailed survey of story generation begins with James Meehan's Tale-Spin, interpreted through "possible worlds" theories of fiction (especially as employed by digital media theorists such as Marie-Laure Ryan). Previous interpretations missed important elements of Tale-Spin 's fiction that are not visible in its output. Other story generation systems discussed include Minstrel, Universe, Brutus, and Terminal Time. These reveal the inevitably authored nature of simulations of human behavior. Further, the persistently anthropomorphizing approach to computational processes present in traditional artificial intelligence (and many critiques) is contrasted with authorship. Also discussed is Christopher Strachey's love letter generator for the Manchester Mark I---likely the first work of digital literature, and arguably the first digital art of any kind. As with Tale-Spin, an interpretation of its processes offers more than output-focused approaches. In addition, this study considers works with algorithmic processes carried out by authors and audiences (rather than within the works) created by Raymond Queneau, Tristan Tzara, and Claude Shannon. Prior theoretical concepts are engaged, including Espen Aarseth's "cybertext," Michael Mateas's "expressive AI," and Chris Crawford's "process intensity." A set of concepts and vocabulary are proposed, beginning with the simple distinction between "surface," "data," and "process." Further chapters introduce the terms "implemented processes," "abstract processes," and "works of process." The most unfamiliar new term, "operational logics," names behavioral elements of systems that can be as elemental as gravity or as high-level as a quest structure. The computer game Fable embodies the strengths and weaknesses of using the same logics to drive graphical and linguistic behavior.},

abstract = {The concept of “agency” in games and other playable media (also referred to as “intention”) has been discussed as a player experience and a structural property of works. We shift focus, considering agency, instead, as a phenomenon involving both player and game, one that occurs when the actions players desire are among those they can take (and vice versa) as supported by an underlying computational model. This shifts attention away from questions such as whether agency is “free will” (it is not) and toward questions such as how works evoke the desires agency satisfies, employ computational models in the service of player action and ongoing dramatic probability, use interfaces and mediation to encourage appropriate audience expectation, shift from initial audience expectation to an understanding of the computational model, and can be shaped with recognition of the inherently improvisational nature of agency. We focus particularly on agency in relation to the fictional worlds of games and other playable media.},

RoleModel expands the expressiveness of stories generated from arbitrary partial domain specification by using a formal model of roles within an abductive logic programming framework. Authorial goals in the system can be fully or partially specified as constraints in an abductive logic program. In particular, the RoleModel system focuses on representing and satisfying role constraints of the story characters. This paper discusses the basic architecture for the RoleModel approach, demonstrates example output from the system through three use-cases, discusses the authorial expressiveness enabled by a stageless abductive logic approach to story generation, and proposes the current and future directions.},

Through conversations with Palestinian and Israeli photographers, I shed light on the visual and national anxiety that photography of the Palestinian land- scape produces in the shadow of the Wall's construction. Building on Gil Hochberg's conceptualization of visual poli- tics, through which the Israeli state dominates the visual field, I argue that the significance of Israeli photographers' work lies in visualizing what is made invisible by the state. For Palestinians, the significance of their photography of the landscape lies in resisting the visual politics dictated by the Israeli regime. I conclude by offering questions about the role of photography in subverting visual politics in Palestine and Israel.},

abstract = {Ideally, open multi-agent systems (MAS) involve heterogeneous and autonomous agents whose interactions ought to conform to some shared conventions. The challenge is how to express and enforce such conditions so that truly autonomous agents can adscribe to them. One way of addressing this issue is to look at MAS as environments regulated by some sort of normative framework. There have been significant contributions to the formal aspects of such normative frameworks, but there are few proposals that have made them operational. In this paper a possible step towards closing that gap is suggested. A normative language is introduced which is expressive enough to represent the familiar types of MAS-inspired normative frameworks; its implementation in JESS is also shown. This proposal is aimed at adding flexibility and generality to electronic institutions by extending their deontic components through richer types of norms that can still be enforced on-line.},

We provide corrective information for students, instructors, and researchers regarding these terms, which we organize for expository purposes into five categories: inaccurate or misleading terms, frequently misused terms, ambiguous terms, oxymorons, and pleonasms. For each term, we (a) explain why it is problematic, (b) delineate one or more examples of its misuse, and (c) when pertinent, offer recommendations for preferable terms. By being more judicious in their use of terminology, psychologists and psychiatrists can foster clearer thinking in their students and the field at large regarding mental phenomena.},

Features include: The use of boxes to strengthen the narrative: pieces that provide historical context, descriptions of how the algorithms are used in practice, and excursions for the mathematically sophisticated. Carefully chosen advanced topics that can be skipped in a standard one-semester course, but can be covered in an advanced algorithms course or in a more leisurely two-semester sequence. An accessible treatment of linear programming introduces students to one of the greatest achievements in algorithms. An optional chapter on the quantum algorithm for factoring provides a unique peephole into this exciting topic. In addition to the text, DasGupta also offers a Solutions Manual, which is available on the Online Learning Center.

In this work, we implement proof-of-concept prototypes of empathic agents with the multi-agent systems development framework Jason and apply argumentation theory to extend the previously introduced concepts to account for inconsistencies between the beliefs of different agents. We then analyze the feasibility of different admissible set-based argumentation semantics to resolve these inconsistencies. As a result of the analysis we identify the maximal ideal extension as the most feasible argumentation semantics for the problem in focus.},

abstract = {The ability to generate narrative is of importance to computer systems that wish to use story effectively for entertainment, training, or education. One of the focuses of intelligent virtual agent research in general and story generation research in particular is how to make agents/characters more lifelike and compelling. However, one question that invariably comes up is: Is the generated story good? An easier question to tackle is whether a reader/viewer of a generated story perceives certain essential attributes such as causal coherence and character believability. Character believability is the perception that story world characters are acting according to their own beliefs, desires, and intentions. We present a novel procedure for objectively evaluating stories generated for multiple agents/characters with regard to character intentionality - an important aspect of character believability. The process transforms generated stories into a standardized model of story comprehension and then indirectly compares that representation to reader/viewer mental perceptions about the story. The procedure is illustrated by evaluating a narrative planning system, Fabulist.},

@article{Vieira2007,
abstract = {Research on agent communication languages has typically taken the speech acts paradigm as its starting point. Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act models of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for communication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be extremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent communication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics typically make reference to the "mental states" of agents (their beliefs, desires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such attitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming languages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone versions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to communication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather ad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to speech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a logic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of the PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural operational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier work on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a computationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in speech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of AgentSpeak that supports agent communication.},

@article{Hawes2011,
abstract = {The ability to achieve ones goals is a defining characteristic of intelligent behaviour. A great many existing theories, systems and research programmes address the problems associated with generating behaviour to achieve a goal; much fewer address the related problems of how and why goals should be generated in an intelligent artifact, and how a subset of all possible goals are selected as the focus of behaviour. It is research into these problems of motivation, which this article aims to stimulate. Building from the analysis of a scenario involving a futuristic household robot, we extend an existing account of motivation in intelligent systems to provide a framework for surveying relevant literature in AI and robotics. This framework guides us to look at the problems of encoding drives (how the needs of the system are represented), goal generation (how particular instances of goals are generated from the drives with reference to the current state), and goal selection (how the system determines which goal instances to act on). After surveying a variety of existing approaches in these terms, we build on the results of the survey to sketch a design for a new motive management framework which goes beyond the current state of the art. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {When entering a system, an agent should be aware of the obligations and prohibitions (collectively norms) that will affect it. Several solutions to this norm identification prob- lem have been proposed, which make use of observations of either other's norm compliant, or norm violating, behaviour. These solutions fail in situations where norms are typically violated, or complied with, respectively. In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach to norm identification which operates by learning from both norm compliant and norm violating behaviour. By utilising both types of behaviour, our work not only overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches, but also yields improved performance over the state-of-the-art. We evaluate its effectiveness empirically, showing, under certain conditions, high accuracy scores. Categories},

abstract = {We propose a genre taxonomy as a knowledge repository of communicative structures or " typified actions " enacted by organizational members. The genre taxonomy is intended to help people make sense of diverse types of communicative actions and provide ideas for improving work processes that coordinate the communication of information. It engages several features to achieve this objective. First, the genre taxonomy represents the elements of both genres and genre systems as embed-ded in a social context reflecting the communicative questions why, what, who, when, where, and how (5W1H). In other words, the genre taxonomy represents the purpose, content, participants, timing, location, and form of communicative action. Second, the genre taxonomy distinguishes between widely recognized genres such as a report and specific genres such as a particular com-pany's technical report, because the difference sheds light on the context of genre use. Third, the genre taxonomy represents use and evolution of a genre over time to help people understand how a genre is used and changed by a community over time. Fourth, the genre taxonomy represents aspects of information coordination via genres, thus providing ideas for improving work processes using genres. We have constructed a prototype of such a genre taxonomy using the Process Hand-book, a process knowledge repository developed at MIT. We have included both widely recognized genres such as the memo and specific genres such as those used in the Process Handbook itself. We suggest that this genre taxonomy may be useful in the innovation of new document templates or methods for communication because it helps to clarify different possible uses of similar gen-res and explicates how genres play a coordination role among people and between people and their tasks.},

@article{Rorty1999,
abstract = {Since Plato most philosophy has aimed at true knowledge, penetrating beneath appearances to an underlying reality. Against this tradition, Richard Rorty convincingly argues, pragmatism offers a new philosophy of hope. One of the most controversial figures in recent philosophical and wider literary and cultural debate, Rorty brings together an original collection of his most recent philosophical and cultural writings. He explains in a fascinating memoir how he began to move away from Plato towards William James and Dewey, culminating in his own version of pragmatism. What ultimately matters, Rorty suggests, is not whether our ideas correspond to some fundamental reality but whether they help us carry out practical tasks and create a fairer and more democratic society.Aimed at a general audience, this volume offers a stimulating summary of Rorty's central philosophical beliefs, as well as some challenging insights into contemporary culture, justice, education, and love.},

@article{Baldoni2009,
abstract = {In most of the existing approaches to the design of multi- agent systems, there is no clear way in which to relate organisational and normative structures to the model of the environment where they are to be situated and operate. Our work addresses this problem by putting together, in a practical approach to developing multi-agent systems (and social simulations in particular), a high-level environment mod- elling language that incorporates aspects of agents, organ- isations, and normative structures. The paper explains in some detail how the ideas of normative objects and nor- mative places, put together as a distributed normative infrastructure, allow the definition of certain kinds of situ- ated multi-agent organisations, in particular organisations for multi-agent systems that operate within concrete envi- ronments. Normative objects are environment objects used to explicitly convey normative content that regulate the behaviour of agents within the place where such objects can be perceived by agents. The paper briefly introduces such concepts, showing how they were integrated into the MAS- SOCmulti-agent systems platform for social simulation, and hints on new problems of (situated) organisational and nor- mative structures that were brought forward by the work presented here.},

abstract = {IEEE Automatic music generation systems have gained in popularity and sophistication as advances in cloud computing have enabled large-scale complex computations such as deep models and optimization algorithms on personal devices. Yet, they still face an important challenge, that of long-term structure, which is key to conveying a sense of musical coherence. We present the MorpheuS music generation system designed to tackle this problem. MorpheuS {\&} {\#}x0027; novel framework has the ability to generate polyphonic pieces with a given tension profile and long- and short-term repeated pattern structures. A mathematical model for tonal tension quantifies the tension profile and state-of-the-art pattern detection algorithms extract repeated patterns in a template piece. An efficient optimization metaheuristic, variable neighborhood search, generates music by assigning pitches that best fit the prescribed tension profile to the template rhythm while hard constraining long-term structure through the detected patterns. This ability to generate affective music with specific tension profile and long-term structure is particularly useful in a game or film music context. Music generated by the MorpheuS system has been performed live in concerts.},

This article investigates how this mechanism might evolve cooperation in a manner that can overcome the tendency towards defec- tion in human societies. We extend Marks analysis by testing his emu- lation model in a social setting where defection is likely, and we offer new models that more accurately capture the learning process of dispro- portionate prior exposure. Our results suggest that this mechanism can account for some evolution of cooperation, and that its strength is greatly influenced by conditions that alter actors perceptions of the joint distribution of fitness and cooperation. We conclude by discussing how cultural mechanisms like stories and myths may magnify the evolution- ary potential of disproportionate prior exposure in cultural evolution.},

abstract = {In many ways and in various tasks, computers are able to outperform humans. They can store and retrieve much larger amounts of data or even beat humans at chess. However, when looking at robots they are still far behind even a small child in terms of their performance capabilities. Even a sophisticated robot, such as ASIMO, is limited to mostly pre-programmed behaviours (Weigmann, 2006). The reliance on robots that must be carefully programmed and calibrated before use and thereafter whenever the task changes, is quite unacceptable for robots that have to coexist and cooperate with humans, especially those who are not necessarily knowledgeable about robotics. Therefore there is an increasing need to go beyond robots that are pre-programmed explicitly towards those that learn and are adaptive (Wermter, Weber {\&} Elshaw, 2004; Wermter, Weber, Elshaw, Panchev et al., 2004). Natural, dynamic environments require robots to adapt their behaviour and learn using approaches typically used by animals or humans...},

@article{Tomer2017,
abstract = {Buddhist economics embodies a world view that is very different from the world views of Western economies.  The world views of the latter are largely based on the tenets of mainstream economics.  The world view of every society reflects its citizens' values, especially their values concerning how their economies should function.  The functioning of all economies needs to be built on an explicit set of values related to the society's economic goals.  The world views associated with Western or modern capitalist economies are typically narrowly oriented and emphasize growth of output.  The world view of Buddhist economics, on the other hand, emphasizes a very broad view of what contributes to well-being.  The latter world view emphasizes the ideal relationships that humans can develop with each other and with nature.  This paper analyzes and outlines why a society adopting Buddhist economics can be expected to experience much less socio-economic and biophysical dysfunction than can be expected for  conventionally oriented capitalist societies.   Human activities are increasingly having massive negative consequences for both the biosphere and socio-economic relationships.  Climate change is a prominent example of biophysical dysfunction, and obesity is an important example of socio-economic dysfunction.  The world view and orientation of mainstream economics does little to help us understand the causes of these large dysfunctions, nor to understand what is necessary to resolve them.  Mainstream economics does not provide the key insights into the socio-economic causes of the market failures involved.  For example, it provides little appreciation of the tendency of businesses to be excessively self-interested, opportunistic, and exploitive in its relationships with consumers and others.  The idea that businesses might embrace social responsibility and attempt to serve people's true preferences rather their actual preferences is foreign to mainstream economics.  Mainstream economics also does not help us understand the excessive growth of the Earth's economic activity and the excessive use of fossil fuel energy.  Further, it does not help us understand that consumers' ignorance and inability to find satisfaction with their consumption are principal factors in contemporary biophysical dysfunction.   Because important, large scale dysfunctions such as climate change and obesity have been largely outside the scope of mainstream economics, the types of analysis most suitable for understanding them have not been developed.  It follows that mainstream economists are unlikely to propose viable solutions for these dysfunctions.  Interestingly, it turns out that many of the answers can be found by turning to the wisdom embodied in Buddhism.  As Thich Nhat Hanh has stated, what is needed is a collective enlightenment.  We need to draw on Buddhist teachings such as the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.  These teachings can help us understand why dishonest businesses that are not concerned with the true well-being of their customers are part of the problem.  It will also help us understand that ignorant, compulsive consumer behavior is an integral part of the dysfunctions.  Ideally, people ought to consume mindfully and moderately, using intelligent reflection on their choices in order for their consumption to contribute to their true well-being.  If a society were to adopt Buddhist economics, and if people and businesses were to behave in accord with the ideals articulated in Buddhist teachings, there is good reason to believe that the result would be sustainable use of the Earth's resources and that both biophysical and socio-economic dysfunctions would be avoided or resolved.  Clearly, we need Buddhist economics.},

abstract = {In hundreds of articles by experts from around the world, and in overviews and "road maps" prepared by the editor, The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks charts the immense progress made in recent years in many specific areas related to two great questions: How does the brain work? and How can we build intelligent machines? While many books have appeared on limited aspects of one subfield or another of brain theory and neural networks, the Handbook covers the entire sweep of topics—from detailed models of single neurons, analyses of a wide variety of biological neural networks, and connectionist studies of psychology and language, to mathematical analyses of a variety of abstract neural networks, and technological applications of adaptive, artificial neural networks. The excitement, and the frustration, of these topics is that they span such a broad range of disciplines including mathematics, statistical physics and chemistry, neurology and neurobiology, and computer science and electrical engineering as well as cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. Thus, much effort has gone into making the Handbook accessible to readers with varied backgrounds while still providing a clear view of much of the recent, specialized research in specific topics. The heart of the book, part III, comprises of 267 original articles by leaders in the various fields, arranged alphabetically by title. Parts I and II, written by the editor, are designed to help readers orient themselves to this vast range of material. Part I, Background, introduces several basic neural models, explains how the present study of brain theory and neural networks integrates brain theory, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology, and provides a tutorial on the concepts essential for understanding neural networks as dynamic, adaptive systems. Part II, Road Maps, provides entry into the many articles of part III through an introductory "Meta-Map" and twenty-three road maps, each of which tours all the Part III articles on the chosen theme.},

abstract = {In this study the focus is set on parental rules for digital gaming and Internet use. First a review of the field is presented followed by analyses of adolescents' media use and parental strategies for regulation. Data was derived from a Swedish survey of parents—Predominantly mothers—of adolescents aged 9-16 complemented with data from a separate survey of adolescents aged 9-16. Analyses are presented using gamma coefficients for bivariate correlations and linear regression models for multivariate analyses. We conclude that parents in this study are involved in their adolescents' gaming and Internet by restricting access to these media. Boys and young adolescents are controlled more than girls and older adolescents. Mothers made use of restrictive mediation more than fathers. Parents harbour quite negative views on gaming which might interfere with a more active role of parents in mediating their children's gaming},

After an overview of the topology of complex networks, such as the Internet and the WWW, data-driven models for human dynamics are given. These models motivate the study of network dynamics and suggest that complexity theory must incorporate the interactions between dynamics and structure. The article also advances the notion that an understanding of network dynamics is facilitated by the availability of large data sets and analysis tools gained from the study of network structure.},

@book{DouglasCrockford2008,
abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

It considers the rich traditions of Arab, Jewish and Latin philosophy, which began to flourish in the ninth century and continued, in the Latin West, until the early seventeenth century. Among the philosophers treated in detail are Avicenna and Averroes, Maimonides, Eriugena, Anselm, Abelard, Grosseteste, Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, Peter Aureoli, William of Ockham, Wyclif and Su{\'{a}}rez. An introductory chapter discusses Boethius, the late antique thinker who was enormously influential in the medieval Latin West. Special attention has been given to many lesser-known, but important figures in each period, as well as to medieval logic and to the cultural context of medieval philosophy, both in Islam and the Christian West. This volume provides a comprehensive analysis of the main areas of medieval philosophy by the experts in each field. It offers fresh perspectives on a complex and rapidly changing area of research, in which Arab and Jewish philosophy are considered in their own right, rather than as sources for Latin thinkers, and the thirteenth century (the time of Aquinas) is not viewed as dominating the earlier and later parts of the period.},

One thing that it can mean— and in the Palestinian case of nearly seventy years of displacement, what it necessarily has meant for many people—is to die as a refugee. This essay explores the conse- quences of the ways in which humanitarian work has been compelled to take up the end of life as a humanitarian concern. Drawing on fieldwork in the Burj al Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, it explores care for the aging and dying as a setting in which key aspects of the social world produced through humanitarianism are brought into existence and view. The problems of the end of life introduce ad- ditional challenges into the conundrums of long-term humanitarianism, occurring at the intersection of humanitarian practice and Palestinian experience. With the ques- tions of services for the aging and dying foregrounded, the possibility of the future becomes a site of confrontation among, and within, providers and recipients. Often, this future appears to be foreclosed.},

Static and mechanistic analysis, however, is not adequate to understand the changing world in which we live. In order to adequately address the most pressing social and environmental challenges looming ahead, we need to develop analytical tools for analyzing dynamic situations – particularly institutional change. In this paper, we develop an analytical tool to study institutional change, more specifically, the evolution of rules and norms.We believe that in order for such an analytical tool to be useful to develop a general theory of institutional change, it needs to enable the analyst to concisely record the processes of change in multiple specific settings so that lessons from such settings can eventually be integrated into a more general predictive theory of change.},

In this paper we compare two kinds of models of character style: one based on models derived from the Big Five theory personality, and the other derived from a corpus-based method applied to characters and films from the IMSDb archive. We apply these models to character utterances for a pilot narrative-based outdoor augmented reality game called Murder in the Arboretum. We use an objective quantitative metric to estimate the quality of a character model, with the aim of predicting model quality without perceptual experiments. We show that corpus-based character models derived from individual characters are often more detailed and specific than personality based models, but that there is a strong correlation between personality judgments of original character dialogue and personality judgments of utterances generated for Murder in the Arboretum that use the derived character models.},

@article{Goguen1984,
abstract = {There is a population explosion among the logical systems being used in computer science. Examples include first order logic (with and without equality), equational logic, Horn clause logic, second order logic, higher order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic, process logic, temporal logic, and modal logic; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic logical system. Yet it is usual to give many of the same results and applications for each logical system; of course, this is natural in so far as there are basic results in computer science that are independent of the logical system in which they happen to be expressed. But we should not have to do the same things over and over again; instead, we should generalize, and do the essential things once and for all! Also, we should ask what are the relationships among all these different logical systems. This paper shows how some parts of computer science can be done in any suitable logical system, by introducing the notion of an institution as a precise generalization of the informal notion of a "logical system." A first main result shows that if an institution is such that interface declarations expressed in it can be glued together, then theories (which are just sets of sentences) in that institution can also be glued together. A second main result gives conditions under which a theorem prover for one institution can be validly used on theories from another; this uses the notion of an institution morphism. A third main result shows that institutions admiting free models can be extended to institutions whose theories may include, in addition to the original sentences, various kinds of constraints upon interpretations; such constraints are useful for defining abstract data types, and include so-called "data," "hierarchy," and "generating" constraints. Further results show how to define insitutions that mix sentences from one institution with constraints from another, and even mix sentences and (various kinds of) constraints from several different institutions. It is noted that general results about institutions apply to such "multiplex" institutions, including the result mentioned above about gluing together theories. Finally, this paper discusses some applications of these results to specification languages, showing that much of that subject is in fact independent of the institution used.},

As this approach requires a consistent structure, our concept proposes an adaption of Scrum that is based on the game development life-cycle: ABC-Sprints consist of three Sprints to iteratively create Alpha, Beta and Completed versions of a game. We present a detailed walkthrough of the course and give results of a formal evaluation. These indicate that ABC-Sprints help students to manage their workload and to increase productivity over time. Consequently, three teams each presented a game at the end of the course that tech- nically exceeded typical outcomes of game projects without lectures. We hence encourage to apply ABC-Sprints to other curricula and provide a set of recommendations.},

abstract = {Since production systems (PS's) were first proposed by Post (1943) general computational mechanism, the methodology has seen a great deal of development and has been applied to a diverse collection of problems. Despite the wide scope of goals and perspectives demonstrated by the various systems, there appear to be many recurrent themes. We present an analysis and overview of those themes, as well as a conceptual frame-work by which many of the seemingly disparate efforts can be viewed, both in relation to each other and to other methodologies. Accordingly, we use the term production system in a broad sense and show how most systems that have used the term can be fit into the framework. The comparison to other methodologies is intended to provide a view of PS characteristics in a broader context, with primary reference to procedurally based techniques, but also with reference to more recent developments in programming and the organization of data and knowledge bases. This chapter begins by offering a review of the essential structure and function of a PS, presenting a picture of a "pure" PS to provide a basis for subsequent elaborations. Current views of PS's fall into two distinct classes, and we shall demonstrate that this dichotomy may explain much of the existing variation in goals and methods. This is followed by some specu-lations on the nature of appropriate and inappropriate problem domains for PS's i.e., what is it about a problem that makes the PS methodology appropriate, and how do these factors arise out of the system's basic struc-ture and function? Next, we review characteristics common to all systems, explaining how they contribute to the basic character and noting their This chapter is based on an article taken with permission from Machine Intelligence 8: Machine Representations of Knowledge, edited by E.

abstract = {The article is concerned with the latest developments in Indonesia's Islamic field. Its focus is on the role of social media in exchange relationships between Islamic preachers and their constituency. The article first discusses economic exchanges between preachers and their followers, and then it concentrates on social exchanges and how they are mediated today. Empirically, the article delivers insight into the concerns of mostly female Indonesian middle-class Muslims and shows how preachers have to adjust to the needs of their followers who are regularly online. Theoretically, the article offers a rereading of Pierre Bourdieu's classic work on forms of capital and their conversion. It emphasizes the temporal dimension of capital accumulation and conversion and explores the temporalities of online exchanges that have become constitutive of preacher–follower relationships. In doing so, it shows how Indonesia's Islamic preacher economy is currently transformed by these online exchanges, resulting in preacher–follower relationships that are characterized by dialogic constructions of Islamic authority. Being part of Indonesia's Islamic field, these changes in the Islamic preacher economy point to a broader trend in Indonesia's Islamic field toward greater sensitivity to the needs and worries of Indonesian middle-class Muslims.},

abstract = {World of Warcraft (WoW) is a popular Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) that requires gamers to play in one of two factions: the Horde or the Alliance. Although deemphasized in more recent versions of the game, the Horde has traditionally been considered the "evil" faction, whereas the Alliance has been considered the "good" faction. Researchers have identified differences between these two factions with respect to gameplay, although the mechanisms for these differences are unclear. The present study investigated whether faction-based differences extend to psychological traits and symptoms. The results indicated that members of the Horde obtained higher scores on measures of interpersonal dependency and three measures of problematic WoW use. Obsession with World of Warcraft was particularly salient in predicting faction membership, with higher scores on the obsession variable predicting membership to the Horde. Possible explanations for the observed differences are suggested, limitations are reviewed, and directions for future research are indicated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cumulative proportion of youth who self-report having been arrested or taken into custody for illegal or delinquent offenses (excluding arrests for minor traffic violations) from ages 8 to 23 years. METHODS: Self-reported arrest history data (excluding arrests for minor traffic violations) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (N = 7335) were examined from 1997 to 2008. RESULTS: By age 18, the in-sample cumulative arrest prevalence rate lies between 15.9{\%} and 26.8{\%}; at age 23, it lies between 25.3{\%} and 41.4{\%}. These bounds make no assumptions at all about missing cases. If we assume that the missing cases are at least as likely to have been arrested as the observed cases, the in-sample age-23 prevalence rate must lie between 30.2{\%} and 41.4{\%}. The greatest growth in the cumulative prevalence of arrest occurs during late adolescence and the period of early or emerging adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Since the last nationally defensible estimate based on data from 1965, the cumulative prevalence of arrest for American youth (particularly in the period of late adolescence and early adulthood) has increased substantially. At a minimum, being arrested for criminal activity signifies increased risk of unhealthy lifestyle, violence involvement, and violent victimization. Incorporating this insight into regular clinical assessment could yield significant benefits for patients and the larger community.},

@article{Byrne2000,
abstract = {When people think about what might have been, they undo an outcome by changing events in regular ways. Suppose two contestants could win 1,000 Pounds if they picked the same color card; the first picks black, the second red, and they lose. The temporality effect refers to the tendency to think they would have won if the second player had picked black. Individuals also think that the second player will experience more guilt and be blamed more by the first. We report the results of five experiments that examine the nature of this effect. The first three experiments examine the temporality effect in scenarios in which the game is stopped after the first contestant's card selection because of a technical hitch, and then is restarted. When the first player picks a different card, the temporality effect is eliminated, for scenarios based on implicit and explicit negation and for good outcomes. When the first player picks the same card, the temporality effect occurs in each of these situations. The second two experiments show that it depends on the order of events in the world, not their descriptive order. It occurs for scenarios without preconceptions about normal descriptive order; it occurs whether the second event is mentioned in second place or first. The results are consistent with the idea that the temporality effect arises because the first event is presupposed and so it is immutable; and the elimination of the temporality effect arises because the availability of a counterfactual alternative to the first event creates an opposing tendency to mutate it. We sketch a putative account of these effects based on characteristics of the mental models people construct when they think counterfactually.},

abstract = {Welcome to a book written to challenge you, improve your brainstorming abilities, and sharpen your game design skills! Challenges for Game Designers: Non-Digital Exercises for Video Game Designers is filled with enjoyable, interesting, and challenging exercises to help you become a better video game designer, whether you are a professional or aspire to be. Each chapter covers a different topic important to game designers, and was taken from actual industry experience. After a brief overview of the topic, there are five challenges that each take less than two hours and allow you to apply the material, explore the topic, and expand your knowledge in that area. Each chapter also includes 10 `non-digital shorts' to further hone your skills. None of the challenges in the book require any programming or a computer, but many of the topics feature challenges that can be made into fully functioning games. The book is useful for professional designers, aspiring designers, and instructors who teach game design courses, and the challenges are great for both practice and homework assignments. The book can be worked through chapter by chapter, or you can skip around and do only the challenges that interest you. As with anything else, making great games takes practice and Challenges for Game Designers provides you with a collection of fun, thoughtprovoking, and of course, challenging activities that will help you hone vital skills and become the best game designer you can be.

abstract = {In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed a three-component model of working memory. Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.},

RoleModel expands the expressiveness of stories generated from arbitrary partial domain specification by using a formal model of roles within an abductive logic programming framework. Authorial goals in the system can be fully or partially specified as constraints in an abductive logic program. In particular, the RoleModel system focuses on representing and satisfying role constraints of the story characters. This paper discusses the basic architecture for the RoleModel approach, demonstrates example output from the system through three use-cases, discusses the authorial expressiveness enabled by a stageless abductive logic approach to story generation, and proposes the current and future directions.},

NASEM reports aim to give the public and policymakers information on socially relevant science issues. Their impact, however, is not well understood. This analysis combines national pre- and post-report survey data with a large-scale content analysis of Twitter discussion to examine the report's effect on public perceptions of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We find that the report's release corresponded with reduced negativity in Twitter discourse and increased ambivalence in public risk and benefit perceptions of GMOs, mirroring the NASEM report's conclusions. Surprisingly, this change was most likely for individuals least trusting of scientific studies or university scientists. Our findings indicate that NASEM consensus reports can help shape public discourse, even in, or perhaps because of, the complex information landscape of traditional and social media.},

abstract = {Given the complexity of the current nuclear age and the absence of work on deterrence under true multipolarity, interdisciplinary models can provide new perspectives on tailored deterrence. Drawing from recent findings in the life sciences, this article offers a cultural neuroscience approach to deterrence decision-making, with special attention given to the ways in which culture interacts with cognition and the security environment to shape behavioral outcomes during conflict. Since North Korea remains largely a “black box” in international relations, a cultural neuroscience perspective can provide valuable insight into the effects of cultural conditioning on perception and cognition within the context of nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula. Through an analysis of the bureaucratic and military structures, leadership characteristics, and institutional landscapes shaping North Korean strategic culture, this article examines the influences of historical memory and cultural values, such as collectivism, honor, and face-saving, on political decision-making in Pyongyang.},

abstract = {The world can be resolved into digital bits, with each bit made of smaller bits. — Ed Fredkin It ' s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc. The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. — Marvin Minsky Many different fields have contributed ideas and methods to ABM. In this appendix, we will focus on the key antecedents of ABM technologies from computer science and associated computational fields. Besides the computational fields, we note that there have also been strong contributions from biology, physics, engineering, and social science. In biology, these contributions came largely from ecology and the independent development of Individual-Based Model-ing alongside ABM (DeAngelis {\&} Gross, 1992). Individual-based modeling foregrounds the role of individual animal or plant behavior in an ecosystem, as opposed to working with population-level variables (DeAngelis {\&} Mooij, 2005). Moreover, like ABM, IBM models are often placed within particular landscapes or environments, and IBM modelers focus on how landscapes can greatly affect the results of a model (Grimm {\&} Railsback, 2005). Much of IBM methodology has become incorporated into ABM work. In physics, the Ising models were used to describe magnetics and showed that very simple models could produce phase transition. These models were also precursors of cel-lular automata. As described in chapter 3, physicist Per Bak created the classic Sandpile model, which Bak used to illustrate the concept of self-organizing criticality (SOC). He went on to apply physics-based methods to complex phenomena across many content domains (such as the Fire model in chapter 3 and various stock market models) and showed the relationship of power laws to SOC. In engineering, process engineering and cybernetics, among other areas of research, contributed to ABM ' s development. In process engineering, the goal is to design an optimal output given low-level behaviors, which can be thought of as a similar framework to ABM, 432 Appendix but with a different goal. As such, some of the tools and methods of process engineering are also useful in the context of ABM. The field of cybernetics branched off from process and control engineering, focusing on general properties of feedback in systems. This led to notions of system phase shifts, that is, areas of parameter-space where small changes can have disproportionate consequences (Wiener, 1961). In a similar vein, as engineering models became more complex, they needed to deal with stochasticity, which led to the techniques of Monte Carlo simulation (Metropolis {\&} Ulam, 1949), wherein models are run repeatedly in order to understand its range of outputs or search for an optimal output. As with process and cybernetic engineers, social scientists came to the realization that social organizations ' complexities were not sufficiently captured by available modeling tools. As a result, social scientists started using algorithmic and computational models to describe social phenomena. These models could be reasoned about and falsifiable predic-tions could be made from them, thus allowing the models to be tested. This provided social scientists with a method of comparing empirical data to predicted data akin to that of natural scientists (Lave {\&} March, 1975). Nash ' s (1950) game theory models were some of the earliest attempts to capture human behavior in mathematical equations. Most of these initial social science models used aggregate data averaged across individuals. For instance, the famous Club of Rome model made very simple assumptions about how world population would increase and how resources would be consumed (Meadows, 1972). These efforts gave rise over time to Systems Dynamic Modeling (SDM; Forrester, 1961), which proposed creating models using stocks (the quantities of goods, entities, or objects in particular locations) and flows (the rates of increase or decrease in these stocks). SDM modelers made important contributions to complex systems, but because the elements in System Dynamics models were mass quantities, a logical step was to shift down a level, modeling the individuals that make up the mass quantity. Thus, for modelers interested in SDM, agent-based modeling was a natural progression that enabled a deeper examination of the behavior of heterogeneous individuals. In fact, partly because of this need for social science to understand individual behavior in an increasingly rich framework, some of the earliest agent-based models arose in the social sciences. Schelling ' s model of segregation (discussed in chapter 3) is considered by many to be one of the first agent-based models ever devised, even though it was carried out manually using a checkerboard and coins (Schelling, 1971). Schelling ' s book Micromotives and Macrobehavior (1978) demon-strated how individual level actions could give rise to surprising social patterns. His Segregation model showed that housing segregation would occur even if no individual wants it, as long as people have a preference not be in an extreme minority in their neighborhood. In the last decade, we have witnessed tremendous growth in the field of network theory and the incorporation of support for networks as a core element of agent-based modeling. This work was pioneered by the mathematician Euler in the 1800s in solving the problem of the seven bridges of Konigsberg (see Newman, 2010). In the 1950s and early ' 60s,},

In this paper we present a method for proceduralist readings of arcade-like 2D games so that players can determine their range of intended and unintended meanings, critics can assess the strengths and weaknesses of the presented arguments, and designers can identify ways to refine their rhetorical strategies. Through identifying the components of games that can be interpreted and emphasizing where cultural considerations influence interpretations, we present a framework for meaning derivations that strive to take the entirety of a game into consideration. As demonstrated by several examples, this framework requires much more explicit and formal arguments for why a game carries a meaning and precisely where each component of one's argument came from.},

abstract = {The design of games can be an unfortunately indirect endeavour: the designer's objective may be to present the player with a particular set of possible experiences, or playspace, but what the designer actually creates (i.e. the game) is instead an artifact intended to produce the desired playspace only upon interaction. In this work we develop both a general framework and specific implementation for providing a designer a way to reason about and edit a game level's playspace. Our system enables a designer to specify edits to playspace properties using a small set of local playspace edits and constraints. It then automatically (via optimization) produces a new level configuration that reflects the desired playspace changes. We present results from our system demonstrating the usefulness of our approach. This work constitutes an initial step toward a fully-realized playspace level design tool.},

abstract = {Modern systems evolve in unpredictable environments and have to continuously adapt their behavior to changing conditions. The "DReAM" (Dynamic Reconfigurable Architecture Modeling) framework, has been designed for modeling reconfigurable dynamic systems. It provides a rule-based language, inspired from Interaction Logic, which is expressive and easy to use encompassing all aspects of dynamicity including parametric multi-modal coordination with creation/deletion of components as well as mobility. Additionally, it allows the description of both endogenous/modular and exogenous/centralized coordination styles and sound transformations from one style to the other. The DReAM framework is implemented in the form of a Java API bundled with an execution engine. It allows to develop runnable systems combining the expressiveness of the rule-based notation together with the flexibility of this widespread programming language.},

We viewed computational systems from an external perspective, with a focus on the institutional and the social aspects of these systems. The social constraints and roles of the open societies were specified with the use of the Event Calculus. In this paper, we formalise our frame- work with the use of the C+ language, a formalism with explicit state transition semantics. We use the implementation of the C+ language, the Causal Calculator, a software tool for representing commonsense knowledge about action and change, to animate and validate the spec- ifications of computational societies. We demonstrate the utility of the Causal Calculator (by specifying and executing a Contract-Net Pro- tocol) and comment on its functionality regarding the specification of computational societies.},

abstract = {We present Buzz, a novel programming language for heterogeneous robot swarms. Buzz advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to define swarm behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and of the overall swarm. Single-robot primitives include robot-specific instructions and manipulation of neighborhood data. Swarm-based primitives allow for the dynamic management of robot teams, and for sharing information globally across the swarm. Self-organization stems from the completely decentralized mechanisms upon which the Buzz run-time platform is based. The language can be extended to add new primitives (thus supporting heterogeneous robot swarms), and its run-time platform is designed to be laid on top of other frameworks, such as Robot Operating System. We showcase the capabilities of Buzz by providing code examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of the run-time platform through realistic simulated experiments with representative swarm algorithms.},

Compared to the instrumental programs (e.g., Adobe Photoshop ), these intentional systems (e.g., George Lewis' musical system Voyager ) seem to produce output that is "about" certain things in the world rather than the mere execution of algorithmic rules. This dissertation investigates such phenomena with two central research questions: (1) How is system intentionality formed? and (2) What are the design implications for building systems that utilize such intentionality as an expressive resource. In the discourse of artificial intelligence (AI) practice, system intentionality is typically seen as a technical and ontological property of a computer program, emerging from its underlying algorithms and knowledge engineering. Distilling from the areas of hermeneutics, actor-network theory, cognitive semantics theory, and philosophy of mind, this dissertation proposes a humanistic and interpretive framework called the AI hermeneutic network . It accentuates that system intentionality is narrated and interpreted by its human creators and users in their socio-cultural settings. Special attention is paid to system authors' discursive strategies, a constitutive component of AI, embedded in their source code and technical literature. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a close analytical reading of a full-scale AI system, Copycat . The theoretical discovery leads to new design strategies, namely scale of intentionality and agency play . They provide insights for using system intentionality and agency as expressive resources that can be used to convey meanings and express ideas. The fruits of these insights are illustrated by a stream of consciousness literature inspired interactive narrative project Memory, Reverie Machine, co-developed using Harrell's GRIOT system. It portrays a protagonist whose intentionality and agency vary dynamically in service of narrative needs.},

@article{Malone2009,
abstract = {Over the past decade, the rise of the Internet has enabled the emergence of surprising new forms of collective intelligence. Examples include Google, Wikipedia, Threadless, and many others. To take advantage of the possibilities these new systems represent, it is necessary to go beyond just seeing them as a fuzzy collection of "cool" ideas. What is needed is a deeper understanding of how these systems work. This article offers a new framework to help provide that understanding. It identifies the underlying building blocks - to use a biological metaphor, the "genes" - at the heart of collective intelligence systems. These genes are defined by the answers to two pairs of key questions: - Who is performing the task? Why are they doing it? - What is being accomplished? How is it being done? The paper goes on to list the genes of collective intelligence - the possible answers to these key questions - and shows how combinations of genes comprise a "genome" that characterizes each collective intelligence system. In addition, the paper describes the conditions under which each gene is useful and the possibilities for combining and re-combining these genes to harness crowds effectively. Using this framework, managers can systematically consider many possible combinations of genes as they seek to develop new collective intelligence systems.},

In software engineering, usual top-down approaches become inadequate to design such systems.

This bottom-up approach provides adaptive, scalable, and robust systems.

abstract = {How Canadians Communicate: Contexts of Popular Culture is the third in a series of books meant both to chronicle and to contribute to our understanding of the Canadian experience. The first volume focused on the challenges that Canadian media and communication industries faced as they entered the first years of the twenty-first century. The second volume dealt with the impact of globalization on Canadian media and culture and how Canadians both adapt to and resist these influences. This third volume describes not only the sites of popular culture—social media, video games, art, mem- ory institutions, cinema, sports, and so on—but the seeds and sparks that create these explosions of expression and creativity. But these experiences intersect with gender, social class, language, region, ethnic heritage, and age, among other factors and conditions to determine how we use and give meaning to pop- ular culture. The book raises critical issues about our uses of myths and stereo- types, how we define beauty, how we deal with our darkest visions, the role of violence in society, how culture is used both to enforce and to push the bound- aries of convention and social control and how we express our many identities. The hope is that Contexts of Popular Culture will both illuminate this complex and multi-textured landscape, and become a catalyst for research and discussion.},

abstract = {Computer code is a form of notational language. It prescribes actions to be carried out by the computer, often by systems called interpreters. When code is used to write music, we are therefore operating with programming language as a relatively new form of musical notation. Music is a time-based art form and the traditional musical score is a linear chronograph with instructions for an interpreter. Here code and traditional notation are somewhat at odds, since code is written as text, without any representational timeline. This can pose problems, for example, for a composer who is working on a section in the middle of a long piece, but has to repeatedly run the code from the beginning or make temporary arrangements to solve this difficulty in the compositional process. In short: code does not come with a timeline, but is rather the material used for building timelines. The context of creating linear code scores in the area of musical notation is explored. The Threnoscope is presented as an example of a system that implements both representational notation and a prescriptive code score.},

@article{Whitehead2010,
abstract = {Castles, palaces, temples and cathedrals in the real world are densely decorated with ornamentation. Computer games, in contrast, usually have much less and appear Spartan in comparison. Game worlds, whether hand-made or procedural, require greater decorative ornamentation to increase their realism and beauty. Currently artists create this ornament by hand; this doesn't scale. In order to have more decorative artwork in games, procedural algorithms must be developed to generate it, for only this approach will create sufficient quantities, quickly, and at low cost. This paper justifies the importance of decorative ornamentation in computer games and provides an overview of existing research on algorithmic generation of patterns and ornamentation. A series of open research issues demonstrates the breadth of potential research that can be performed in this area. Together, these make the case that procedural decorative ornamentation is a new and interesting research subdomain within the area of procedural content generation for computer games.},

In this article, we examine evidence for perceptual and conceptual implicit memory, using the accepted definitions, and suggest that there is in fact a lack of strong evidence for implicit memory in normal subjects. If more convincing evidence cannot be obtained, one solution might be to modify the current terminology.

abstract = {Since the advent of computers, the natural and engineering sciences have enormously progressed. Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction 1, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far 210. In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web},

It models the fundamental differences in individual susceptibilities to contagion based on the psychology study of Emotional Contagion Scale. The contagion process can also be biased by inter-individual relationships depending on the intimacy and power difference aspects of relationships between agents. Individuals' expressiveness in a group is influenced by both the extroversion personality trait and power difference. Additionally, the computational model includes the process of mood decay, as usually observed in people, expanding its application domain beyond that of pure simulation, like games. In this paper we present simulation results that verify the basic emotional contagion behaviors. The possibility of more complex contagion dynamics depending on agent group relationships is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

The main goal of this paper is to propose, implement and evaluate new approaches to automatic DAs recognition based on sentence structure and prosody. Our system is tested on a Czech corpus that simulates a task of train tickets reservation. With lexical-only information, the classification accuracy is 91{\%}. We proposed two methods to include sentence structure information, which respectively give 94{\%} and 95{\%}. When prosodic information is further considered, the recognition accuracy reaches 96{\%}. ? 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Riedl2004,
abstract = {The ability to generate narrative is of importance to computer systems that wish to use story effectively for entertainment, training, or education. We identify two properties of story – plot coherence and character believability – which play a role in the success of a story. Plot coherence is the perception by audience members that character actions have relevance to the outcome of the story. Character believability is the perception that character actions are motivated by agents' internal beliefs and desires. Unlike conventional planning in which plan goals represent an agent's intended world state, multi-agent story planning involves goals that represent the outcome of a story. In order for the plans' actions to appear believable, multi-agent story planners must determine not only how agents' actions achieve a story's goal state, but must also ensure that each agent appears to be acting intentionally. We present a narrative generation planning system for multi-agent stories that is capable of generating narratives with both strong plot coherence and strong character believability. The planning algorithm uses causal reasoning and a simulated intention recognition process to drive plan creation.},

abstract = {Macrosociology--the study of large-scale social structures andthe fundamental principles of social organization--was the styleof sociology practiced by the founders of the discipline. Today, thesocial theories of Karl Marx, Max Weber, {\'{E}}mile Durkheim, and HerbertSpencer (among others) are commonly studied as part of the history ofthe field, but, although the macrosociological approach that thesethinkers advocated is still employed, it no longer dominates thediscipline. Instead, sociologists typically adopt a narrower focus,specializing in areas such as social psychology, medicine, religion, orthe study of social stratification. Examining the bigger picture is atask often left to public intellectuals.Sociocultural Systems aims to reinstate macrosciology asthe heart of the discipline by demonstrating that both classical andcontemporary macrosociologists stand upon common ground. Focusing onthe broad issues that concerned the founders, Elwell addressesquestions such as: Historically, what factors accounted for the origin,survival, and evolution of sociocultural systems? Why were somesocieties more technologically advanced than others? What is the originof capitalism? What factors determine the allocation of goods andservices within and among societies? What effects do changes ingovernment and economic institutions have on communities?Elwell argues that, as evolution does for biology, themacrosociological paradigm offers an analytical strategy that can beused both to guide and prioritize research in all of the myriadspecialties within sociology and to lay forth an orderly body ofknowledge for students. Clearly articulating important sociologicalprinciples, Sociocultural Systems provides a criticalunderstanding of social institutions and issues, while also furnishinga framework for possible solutions to the perennial social crises thatare part and parcel of the development of human societies.},

@article{Falcone2011,
abstract = {Trust can be viewed at the same time as an instrument both for an agent selecting the right partners in order to achieve its own goals, and for an agent of being selected from other potential partners in order to establish with them a cooperation/collaboration and to take advantage from the accumulated trust. In this paper we will analyze trust as the agents' relational capital. Starting from the classical dependence network with potential partners, we introduce the analysis of what it means for an agent to be trusted and how this condition could be strategically used from it for achieving its own goals, that is, why it represents a form of power. The idea of taking another agent's point of view is especially important if we consider the amount of studies in social science that connect trust with social capital related issues. Although there is a big interest in literature about ‘social capital' and its powerful effects on the wellbeing of both societies and individuals, often it is not clear enough what is it the object under analysis. Individual trust capital (relational capital) and collective trust capital not only should be disentangled, but their relations are quite complicated and even conflicting. To overcome this gap, we propose a study that first attempts to understand what trust is as capital of individuals. In which sense “trust” is a capital. How this capital is built, managed and saved. In particular, how this capital is the result of the others' beliefs and goals. Then we aim to analytically study the cognitive dynamics of this object.},

abstract = {Increasingly, information systems are becoming distributed and pervasive, enabling organizations to deliver services remotely to individuals and to share and store personal information worldwide. However, system developers face significant challenges in identifying and managing the many laws that govern their services and products. To address this challenge, we investigate a method to codify, analyze, and trace relationships among requirements from different regulations that share a common theme of data breach notification. To measure gaps and overlaps between regulations, we applied previously validated requirements metrics. Our findings include a formalization of the legal landscape using operational constructs for high- and low-watermark practices, which business analysts and system developers can use to reason about compliance trade-offs based on perceived businesses costs and risks. We discovered and validated these constructs using five U.S. state data breach notification laws that govern transactions of financial and health information of state residents.},

abstract = {The Game of Nomic was developed to investigate the idea that any modifiable rule-based system could result in situations where the ruleset is paradoxical, contradictory or incomplete. This has interesting and important implications for designers of open, self-organising, rule-based systems, if our concern is to ensure that the system should operate within a 'corridor' of behavior, or should avoid certain non-normative states. To investigate this issue, this paper presents the preliminary design, implementation and operation of a self-organising multi-agent system in which the agents play the Game of Nomic. While not yet in a position to test Suber's hypothesis fully, we can see how different agent strategies can reason, reflect, and make decisions that benefit their internal objectives relative to the game itself, by using an awareness of themselves, other players, the ruleset and the projected outcome of proposed rule modifications. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The first reports on the "Space Magnetic Sail" concept appeared more 30 years ago. During the period since some hundreds of research and scientific works have been published, including hundreds of research report by professors at major famous universities. The author herein shows that all these works related to Space Magnetic Sail concept are technically incorrect because their authors did not take into consideration that solar wind impinging a MagSail magnetic field creates a particle magnetic field opposed to the MagSail field. In the incorrect works, the particle magnetic field is hundreds times stronger than a MagSail magnetic field. That means all the laborious and costly computations in revealed in such technology discussions are useless: the impractical findings on sail thrust (drag), time of flight within the Solar System and speed of interstellar trips are essentially worthless working data! The author reveals the correct equations for any estimated performance of a Magnetic Sail as well as a new type of Magnetic Sail (without a matter ring).},

abstract = {An organisation is defined as a system of social norms. The concept of a norm is the social analogue of the concept of an affordance which Gibson (1968) introduced to account for perception of the physical world. Their conjunction is a logic of Norms and Affordances, Norma, which serves as a meta-model for dynamic organisational systems. All elements in a Norma model have bounded periods of existence. All the dynamics are specified by the authorities governing these bounds. A system to implement Norma has been constructed, called a 'Normbase' handles time intrinsically to achieve a huge reduction in the complexity of a specification. The Normbase allows a system to be prototyped dynamically, as the specification evolves. These methods have been used with great success in reducing implementation and maintenance costs.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Two innovations are enhancing programming languages' capabilities. First, modularity lets you combine independently developed languages without changing their respective definitions. A language is no longer a fixed quantity; you can extend it with domain-specific constructs as needed. Second, projectional editing lets you build editors and IDEs that don't require parsers. Such editors and IDEs support a range of tightly integrated notations, including textual, symbolic, tabular, and graphical notations. In addition, by avoiding parsers, they avoid grammar composition's well-known limitations. Three examples illustrate how these two innovations affect programming-language design. A set of modular extensions of C for embedded programming enables efficient code generation and formal analysis. A language for requirements engineering flexibly combines structured and unstructured (prose) data. Finally, a language for defining insurance rules uses mathematical notation. These examples all rely on the open source JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System) language workbench.

We examine the impact of discourses of race and racism on the psychic construction of 'good' and 'bad' schools and explore how this connected with family practices of secondary school choice and current constructions of UK local educational markets.},

@book{MacKay2005,
abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence in games is typically used for creating player's opponents. Manual edition of intelligent behaviors for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) of games is a cumbersome task that needs experienced designers. Our research aims to assist designers in this task. Behaviours typically use recurring patterns, so that experience and reuse are crucial aspects for behavior design. The use of hierarchical state machines allows working on different abstraction levels, sharing transi- tions and reusing pieces from the more detailed levels. How- ever, the static nature of the design process does not release the designer from the burden to completely specify each be- haviour. Our approach applies Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques to retrieve and reuse stored behaviors represented as hierarchical state machines (actually, behaviour trees). In this paper we focus on dynamic retrieval of behaviours tak- ing into account the world state and the underlying goals to select the most appropriate state machine to guide the NPC behaviour. The global behaviour of the NPC is dynamically built in run time querying the CBR system. We exemplify our approach through a serious game, developed by our research group, with gameplay elements from First-Person Shooter (FPS) games.},

abstract = {1st ed. How often have you heard "anyone can design a game?" While it seems like an easy job, game ideas are cheap and plentiful. Advancing those ideas into games that people want to play is one of the hardest, and most under-appreciated, tasks in the game development cycle. Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design introduces both students and experienced developers to the craft of designing computer and video games for the retail market. The first half of the book is a detailed analysis of the key game design elements: examining game concepts and worlds, storytelling, character and user interface design, core mechanics and balance. The second half discusses each of the major game genres (action, adventure, role-playing, strategy, puzzle, and so on) and identifies the design patterns and unique creative challenges that characterize them. Filled with examples and worksheets, this book takes an accessible, practical approach to creating fun, innovative, and highly playable games. - Publisher. Part 1 : The elements of game design.

Two different control mechanisms including semantic (content-based) filtering of messages and in-stream transformation of messages driven by policies at run-time are discussed. These mechanisms allow a more fine-grained control over dynamic and autonomous agent interactions and increases the confidence of system designers to adopt agent-based approaches in building dynamic, heterogeneous systems. Semantic filtering protects sensitive data transmission from agents of one country to the rest of the coalition members and dynamic transformation reduces the resolution of a data feed from a sensor agent of one country to a client agent in another country.},

Children with autism have been reported to exhibit deficits in the recognition of affective expressions. With the appropriate intervention, elimination of those deficits can be achieved. Interventions are proposed to start as early as possible. Computer-based programs have been widely used with success to teach people with autism to recognize emotions. However, those computer interventions require considerable skills for interaction. Such abilities are beyond very young children with autism as they have major restriction in their ability to interact with computers. Our approach takes account of the specific characteristics of preschoolers with autism and their physical inabilities. By creating an educational computer game which provides physical interaction, we aim to support early intervention and to foster emotion learning.},

The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments.

abstract = {From breathtaking stop-action animation to bittersweet modern fairy tales, filmmaker Tim Burton has become known for his unique visual brilliance -- witty and macabre at once. Now he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic children -- misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the sweetness and the tragedy of these dark yet simple beings -- hopeful, hapless heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world we have long left behind (mostly anyway).},

@article{Baral2003,
abstract = {Preface This book is about the language of logic programming with answer set semantics and its application to knowledge representation, reasoning and declarative problem solving. This book will be useful to researchers in logic programming, declarative programming, artiicial intelligence, knowledge representation, and autonomous agentss to knowledge engineers who would like to create and use large knowledge basess to software practitioners who would like to use declarative programming for fast prototyping, and for developing critical programs that must becorrect with respect a formal speciicationn to programmers of autonomous agents who would like to build intelligent c o m p o n e n ts such as planners, schedulers, and diagnosis and repair systemss and to students and teachers using it as a text book in undergraduate and graduate classes. The bulk of the book focuses on the research in logic programming since 1988, when the stable model semantics was proposed by Gelfond and Lifschitz. The main diierences between this book and earlier books 1 on logic programming (besides the fact that it includes results since those earlier books were written) are: (i) It uses answer set semantics and covers all programs. In contrast the bookby Lloyd covers only stratiied programs, and the bookby Lobo et al. and Alferes et al. use well-founded semantics or its variant with respect to non-stratiied programs. (ii) A big part of this bookis about declarative programming and knowledge representation methodology. It presents several small and big example modules, and presents the theory that describes when modules can becombined, when a module is consistent, how to incorporate an observation, etc. To the bestof our knowledge no bookon logic programming discusses this. (iii) Because it uses answer set semantics which allows multipl{\`{e}}models' of a theory, it is able to go beyond reasoning to declarative problem solving. Thus it includes encoding of applications such as planning, diagnosis, explanation generation, scheduling, combinatorial auctions, abductive reasoning, etc. Most of these applications are related to encoding problems that are NP-complete or beyond. The well-founded semantics used in the other books is less expressive and is mostly suitable for reasoning tasks. The bookdoes devote some attention to well-founded semantics. Since the well-founded semantics is sound with respect to answer set semantics and is easier to compute, in this book it is treated as an approximation to answer-set semantics. (iv) The book discusses the complexity and expressibility issues and identiies subsets belonging to diierent complexity and expressibility classes. (v) It presents algorithms to compute answer sets. Some of the algorithms it discusses use heuristics and other intelligent search ideas. (vi) Unlike the books by Lloyd and Lobo et al. most of the programs discussed in the bookcan berun. It uses the smodels and the dlv interpreter for this and is supplemented by a web site containing a large subset of the example programs as smodels or dlv code. This bookcan beused for an undergraduate (junior-senior level) one semester course and a one semester graduate course. For the undergraduate course it is recommended to cover most of Chapter 1, Chapter 2, a very small part of Chapter 3, Chapter 4, parts of Chapter 5, parts of Chapter 7 and Chapter 8. For a follow-up graduate course it is recommended to cover the remaining material (Chapter 3, most of Chapter 5, Chapter 6, parts of Chapter 7, and Chapter 9) together with a quick overview of Chapters 1, 2, 4 and 8. For a stand alone graduate course that does not have 1 The earlier books that we are referring to are: the books by L l o yd published in 1982 ((rst edition) and 1987 (second edition) titleFoundations of logic programming', the monograph by Lobo, Minker and Rajasekar published in 1992 titleFoundations of disjunctive logic programming', and the monograph by Alferes and Pereira published in 1996 titleReasoning with logic programming'.},

abstract = {This article presents our currents findings from an empirical study of the cognition employed by performers in improvisational theatre. Improvised theatrical performance is an activity in which one or more individuals create a dramatic or comedic performance in real-time and is an interesting example of creative, real-time, collaborative problem solving. Unlike other forms of creative problem solving, improvisers are constrained from explicitly coordinating with the other improvisers on stage or revising their decisions after the fact. This article focuses on the means by which a group of improvisers converge on a shared understanding (i.e. a shared mental model) of what a scene is about and how it should proceed. We present our findings on how improvisers build shared mental models during a performance and discuss our applications of these findings to the design and development of improvisational intelligent agents.},

While several excellent studies have estimated the former prisoner population and the collateral consequences they face, far less is known about the size and scope of the total ex-felon population beyond prison walls, including those who serve their sentences on probation or in jail. This article develops state-level estimates based on demographic life tables and extends previous national estimates of the U.S. ex-felon population to 2010. We estimate that ex- prisoners comprise 2.2 percent of the U.S. voting age population and 10.4 percent of the African American male voting age population; ex-felons comprise 6.4 percent of the voting age population and 25.4 percent of the African American male voting age population. We then discuss the far-reaching consequences of the spatial concentration and enormous growth of these groups since 1980.},

abstract = {1. Executive Summary The Deepwater Horizon spill released over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico raising concerns for human health as well as ecological damage. As oil entered the Gulf of Mexico and inland waters, officials closed fishing areas to protect public health. Health assessment methodology provides a framework for the systematic analysis of the routes by which populations may be exposed to contaminants and the characterization of public health implications. This assessment provides a basis for decision making to protect public health and inform the public of the risks associated with the event. The two major pathways for exposure are the inhalation of volatile compounds and the consumption of oil-contaminated seafood. From a human health perspective, seafood is a possible route of human exposure if the fish or shellfish take up and accumulates contaminants in oil. Crude oil is composed of thousands of hydrocarbons and the composition begins to change, or " weather " , as soon as it enters the environment. Contaminants of concern in crude oil are the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially the aromatic hydrocarbons, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene). Inhalation is the primary route of exposure for the VOCs. The other major compounds of concern are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which have the potential to be taken up by seafood that is consumed by people. PAHs are widespread in the environment and do not accumulate to any extent. Finfish and crustaceans metabolize PAHs and will breakdown and excrete any that are taken up; mollusks breakdown PAHs more slowly and can accumulate these compounds when the amount in the environment is high. Extensive testing must be conducted to reopen closed fishing areas. Federal and state agencies developed a seafood monitoring protocol for reopening of waters closed to fishing. The overall plan utilizes a three tiered screening approach: 1) No visible oil observed in the designated areas; 2) Organoleptic testing of the seafood; and 3) Chemical testing of the seafood. Sampling for organoleptic or chemical analysis occurs only in areas with no visible oil and under consideration for reopening. The seafood monitoring program is designed to test areas free of oil and under consideration for reopening. The tiered approach to sampling screens out areas with observable oil and uses the chemical analysis to confirm the seafood is free of contamination.},

This assumption is challenged by novel words based on proper nouns, as in After Joe listened to the tape of the interview, he did a Richard Nixon to a portion of it i.e., erased. Experiment 1 demonstrated that people interpret verb phrases like do a Nixon against a hierarchy of information assumed to be shared by the speaker and his addressees: Nixon's identity; acts associated with Nixon; types of acts appropriate to the utterance; and the type of act specifically intended. Experiment 2 demonstrated that people expect the intended type of act to be coherent, and to be salient among the acts associated with Nixon. It is argued that creating senses, as with do a Nixon, works differently from selecting senses, and that many words require a mixture of both. {\textcopyright} 1983 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The development of and accessibility to rich virtual environments, both for recreation and training activities leads to the use of intelligent agents to control avatars (and other entities) in these environments. There is a fundamental tension in such systems between tight integration, for performance and low coupling, for generality, flexibility and extensibility. This paper addresses the engineering issues in connecting agent platforms and other software entities with virtual environments, driven by the following informal requirements: (i) accessibility: we would like (easily) to be able to connect any (legacy) software component with the virtual environment (ii) performance: we want the benefits of decoupling, but not at a high price in performance (iii) distribution: we would like to be able to locate functionality where needed, when necessary, but also be location agnostic otherwise (iv) scalability: we would like to support large-scale and geographically dispersed virtual environments. We start from the position that the basic currency unit of such systems can be events. We describe the Bath Sensor Framework, which is a middleware that attempts to satisfy the above goals and to provide a low-latency linking mechanism between event producers and event consumers, while minimising the effect of coupling of components. We illustrate the framework in two complementary case studies using the Jason agent platform, Second Life and AGAVE (a 3D VE for vehicles). Through these examples, we are able to carry out a preliminary evaluation of the approach against the factors above, against alternative systems and demonstrate effective distributed execution.},

abstract = {This paper describes a type-oriented approach to the programming of social middleware. It defines a collection of metamodeling features which allow programmers to declare the social entity types which make up the program of a multiagent society for some application domain. These features are identified and formalised taking into account a specification of social middleware as programmable, abstract machines. Thus, the proposed approach results in the type system of an interaction-oriented programming language. The paper uses the C+ action language and the CCalc tool as formal devices, so that metamodeling features are given formal semantics as new social law abbreviations which complement the causal law abbreviations of C+. This programming language approach contrasts with the informal modeling approach endorsed by organizational methodologies, and promotes higher levels of formality, modularity and reusability in the specification of multiagent societies.},

Depending on the circumstances, effective team cognition includes things like using environmental cues to establish a common ground of understanding, seeing who is around and what they are doing, monitoring the state of artefacts in a shared work setting, noticing other peoples gestures and what they are referring to, and so on (Clark, 1996; Hutchins, 1996).},

The first tool, gringo, is a grounder capable of translating logic pro- grams provided by users into equivalent propositional logic programs. The answer sets of such programs can be computed by clasp, which is a solver. The third tool, clingo, integrates the functionalities of gringo and clasp, thus, acting as a monolithic solver for user programs. Finally, iclingo extends clingo by an incremental mode that incorporates both grounding and solving. For one, this document aims at enabling ASP novices to make use of the aforementioned tools. For another, it provides a reference of their features that ASP adepts might be tempted to exploit.},

abstract = {As anthropology becomes more interested in consciousness and its numerous states, and with a slowly increasing appeal to neuroscience for insights and explanations of consciousness, there is an understandable interest in the components of consciousness and how they combine into alternative states in different sociocultural settings. One of those components should be the complexity of information processing producing the knowing aspect of consciousness. The author introduces an approach to this aspect in the form of conceptual systems theory ( CST), a neo-Piagetian model of cognitive development, which has been used to good effect to explain information processing in social situations but heretofore neglected by anthropologists. The neuroanthropological underpinnings of CST are discussed, as is the range of potential applications to ethnological and ethnographic problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Card games are represented in a previously devised card game description language, a context-free grammar. The syntax of this language allows us to use grammar-guided genetic programming. Candidate card games are evaluated through a cascading evaluation function, a multi-step process where games with undesired properties are progressively weeded out. Three representa- tive examples of generated games are analysed. We observed that these games are reasonably balanced and have skill ele- ments, they are not yet entertaining for human players. The particular shortcomings of the examples are discussed in re- gard to the generative process to be able to generate quality games.},

We argue that the classic distinction between competitive and cooperative modes of gameplay does not transfer to fully account for the interpersonal dynamics of collocated gaming groups.},

abstract = {Social norms and normativity are important parts of social change and social concern, as well as of social order. They are highly pertinent to a number of social disciplines. It is paradoxical that their theorizing and their study, at the core of neoclassical sociology, have been neglected for some time by sociologists, and major advances made from perspectives of rational choice. The marginalization of norms within recent sociology is critically discussed. An analytical field, and some tools for ploughing it, are laid out: of three basic kinds of norms, of normative and non-normative action, of different kinds of fundamental institutions, of bases of norm conformity, and of the dynamics and change of norms. The relevance of normative analysis to a range of areas, from globalization to families, is indicated.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Lisbon Treaty from 2009 introduced the possibility for individual member states to withdraw from the European Union (EU) on the basis of a unilateral decision. In June 2016 the United Kingdom decided to leave the EU invoking article 50 of the treaty. But is withdrawal democratically legitimate? In fact, the all-affected principle suggests that it is undemocratic for subunits to leave larger political units when it adversely affects other citizens without including them in the decision. However, it is unclear what the currency of this affectedness is and, hence, why withdrawal would be undemocratic. We argue that it is the effect of withdrawal on the status of citizens as free and equal that is decisive and that explains why unilateral withdrawal of subunits from larger units is democratically illegitimate. Moreover, on the ‘all-affected status principle' that we develop, even multilaterally agreed withdrawal is undemocratic because the latter diminishes the future ability of citizens to make decisions together regarding issues that affect their status as free and equal. On this basis, we conclude that it is undemocratic for a member state such as the United Kingdom to withdraw from the EU.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper proposes that a reflective software engineering environment will address these problems by employing languages and techniques from the software architecture community. Creating a software system will involve manipulating a collection of views, including low-level code views and high-level architectural views which will be tied together using reflection. This coupling will allow the development environment to automatically identify inconsistencies between the views, and support software engineers in managing architectures during evolution. This paper proposes a research programme which will result in a software engineering environment which addresses problems of software evolution and the maintenance of consistency between architectural views of a software system.},

Through fieldwork conducted simultaneously in physical spaces in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and on social media platforms, this work explores some of the internal diversity of Black Lives Matter through a focus on the lived experiences of Black Muslims as they engage with the movement and their unique positioning in relationship with the issues it aims to address. Through attention to the ways that they are rendered doubly liminal and intersectionally impacted as a result of the prevalence of both anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, police violence as well as faith-based profiling and surveillance, I examine the fusion of spirituality and protest that informs the worship and activism of my interlocutors, the crafting of protest repertoires that draw upon the legacies of African American freedom struggles and Islamic mandates to social justice for the purposes of resisting, reimagining, and reshaping the marginalization that they experience.},

Quixote uses a corpus of exemplar stories to automat-ically engineer a reward function that is used to train virtual agents to exhibit desired behaviors using rein-forcement learning. We show the effectiveness of our system with a case study conducted in a virtual envi-ronment called Robbery World that simulates a bank robbery scenario. In this case study, we use a corpus of stories crowdsourced from Amazon Mechanical Turk to guide learning. We evaluate Quixote under a variety of different conditions to determine the overall effective-ness of the system in Robbery World.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper presents a high-level architectural modeling solution that combines the full generative power of shape grammars with the ease of use and flexibility of a node-based visual language. Our approach comprises a shape data flow character and introduces some novel features, including recursion, parametric flow, and flow filtering. The main development model consists of encapsulating basic operations into semantically-rich, reusable components that can be more easily assembled using filters. Eventually, this enables users to concentrate on the more intuitive and interactive development layers, while the text-based grammar rules are automatically generated.},

abstract = {How might heteronormativity be reproduced and become internalized through biomedical practices? Based on in-depth, person-centered interviews, this paper explores the ways heteronormativity works into medical education through the hidden curriculum. As experienced by my informants, case studies often reinforce unconscious heteronormative orientations and heterosexist/homophobic stereotypes about queer patients among straight and queer medical students alike. I introduce the concept of the irrelevance narrative to make sense of how queer medical students take up a heteronormative medical gaze. Despite recognizing that being queer affects how they interact with patients, my informants describe being queer as irrelevant to their delivery of care. I conclude with a discussion of how these preliminary findings can inform research on knowledge production in biomedical education and practice with an eye toward the tensions between personal and professional identity among biomedical practitioners.

abstract = {Agency in interactive narrative is often narrowly understood as a user's freedom to either perform virtually embodied ac- tions or alter the mechanics of narration at will, followed by an implicit assumption of “the more agency the better.” This paper takes notice of a broader range of agency phenomena in interactive narrative and gaming that may be addressed by integrating accounts of agency from diverse fields such as so- ciology of science, digital media studies, philosophy, and cul- tural theory. The upshot is that narrative agency is contextu- ally situated, distributed between the player and system, and mediated through user interpretation of system behavior and system affordances for user actions. In our new and devel- oping model of agency play, multiple dimensions of agency can be tuned during story execution as a narratively situated mechanism to convey meaning. More importantly, we pro- pose that this model of variable dimensions of agency can be used as an expressive theoretical tool for interactive narrative design. Finally, we present our current interactive narrative work under development as a case study for how the agency play model can be deployed expressively},

Florida modified this ban, restricting it to drug traffickers who commit their offense on or after August 23, 1996. I exploit this sharp cutoff in a regression discontinuity design and find that the ban increases recidivism among drug traffickers. The increase is driven by financially motivated crimes, suggesting that the cut in benefits causes ex-convicts to return to crime to make up for the lost transfer income. },

abstract = {In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more pro vocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities. At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and pro ductivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.1 Writing in Technology and Culture almost two decades ago, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one version of the theme, arguing that "from late neo lithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable."2 This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city, architecture, and the his tory of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other nineteenth century critics of industrial ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, "The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state." Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that "dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism."3 An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is by no means the exclusive property of critics of large-scale high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the "biggest and best" that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice. The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, the space program, and of course nuclear power itself have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces. David Lilienthal, in T.V.A.: Democracy on the March, for example, found this promise in the phos 121 This content downloaded from 144.82.108.120 on Mon,},

However, this alone is not sufficient to make the games seem be- lievable – the game world must also seem to be alive. In order to accomplish this, the world must be populated by realistic charac- ters who behave in a coherent and varied way. Many game develop- ers seem to realize this, and the capacity of the artificial intelligence controlled non-player characters in the games are often large selling points. However, as pointed out by recent research these opponents do not always exhibit realistic, coherent and varied behaviour. We have examined this phenomenon by analysing a number of games where non-player characters are especially important for the play- ers' enjoyment, and established six anti-heuristics that can be used to identify non-desirable behaviour in non-player characters.},

This contribution presents the application of soft computing techniques in the context of content generation for an on-line massive basketball management simulation game (in particular in the virtual trading market of the game). This application is developed in two different directions: (1) a machine learning model to analyze the appeal of the trading market contents (the virtual basketball players in the game), and (2) an evolutionary algorithm to assist users in the design of new contents (training of virtual basketball players).},

abstract = {A crucial aspect of maintaining good mental health is to cope successfully with everyday stressors. This article explores the MP3 player as a technology of coping related to the stress of everyday life, in particular two common stressors in the urban environment: crowding and noise. The MP3 player has become a prime medium for everyday music listening, as individuals can carry a vast amount of music with them wherever they go. This unprecedented availability of music raises questions about its impact on the listener, or, as I will refer to him/her, the music user. In order to better understand the effects of this use, this article asks: how are mobile music devices used as a coping resource or device? The research presented here is based on twelve interviews with regular users of MP3 players who live or work in an urban environment. In fusing research on portable music players with research on stress and coping, this article suggests that the MP3 player may be a valuable coping device, enabling music users to enhance their subjective well-being and mental health.},

abstract = {Electronic markets, dispute resolution and negotiation protocols are three types of application domains that can be viewed as open agent societies. Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and unpredictable behavior. Members of such societies may fail to, or even choose not to, conform to the norms governing their interactions. It has been argued that systems of this type should have a formal, declarative, verifiable, and meaningful semantics. We present a theoretical and computational framework being developed for the executable specification of open agent societies. We adopt an external perspective and view societies as instances of normative systems. In this article, we demonstrate how the frame- work can be applied to specifying and executing a contract-net protocol. The specification is formalized in two action languages, the C+ language and the Event Calculus, and executed using respective software implementations, the Causal Calculator and the Society Visualizer. We evaluate our executable specification in the light of the presented case study, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the employed action languages for the specification of open agent societies.},

However, the costs that institutions can impose are limited, so that their commitment capacity is weak. Institutions can also impose costs as a condition of membership, allowing them to serve as costly signals. A model of weak commitment and costly signaling leads to a number of hypotheses about patterns of cooperation, institutional membership, and states' preferences over institutional design. For example, existing members of an institution should impose higher {\textless}italic{\textgreater}ex ante{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} costs when a potential new member could either gain significant benefits from reneging on their commitments in the future, and when the new member expects to gain high benefits from future cooperation.

However, most of what we know about software-engineering expertise are vague stereotypes, such as 'excellent communicators' and 'great teammates'. The lack of specificity in our understanding hinders researchers from reasoning about them, employers from identifying them, and young engineers from becoming them. Our understanding also lacks breadth: what are all the distinguishing attributes of great engineers (technical expertise and beyond)? We took a first step in addressing these gaps by interviewing 59 experienced engineers across 13 divisions at Microsoft, uncovering 53 attributes of great engineers. We explain the attributes and examine how the most salient of these impact projects and teams. We discuss implications of this knowledge on research and the hiring and training of engineers.},

abstract = {The analysis of user behavior in digital games has been aided by the introduction of user telemetry in game development, which provides unprecedented access to quantitative data on user behavior from the installed game clients of the entire population of players. Player behavior telemetry datasets can be exceptionally complex, with features recorded for a varying population of users over a temporal segment that can reach years in duration. Categorization of behaviors, whether through descriptive methods (e.g. segmentation) or unsupervised/supervised learning techniques, is valuable for finding patterns in the behavioral data, and developing profiles that are actionable to game developers. There are numerous methods for unsupervised clustering of user behavior, e.g. k-means/c-means, Non- negative Matrix Factorization, or Principal Component Analysis. Although all yield behavior categorizations, interpretation of the resulting categories in terms of actual play behavior can be difficult if not impossible. In this paper, a range of unsupervised techniques are applied together with Archetypal Analysis to develop behavioral clusters from playtime data of 70,014 World of Warcraft players, covering a five year interval. The techniques are evaluated with respect to their ability to develop actionable behavioral profiles from the dataset.},

This article is a gentle introduction to the subject; it starts with motivation and follows the historical development of the challenge of defining a semantics for logic programs with negation. It looks into positive programs over stratified programs to arbitrary programs, and then proceeds to extensions with two kinds of negation (named weak and strong negation), and disjunction in rule heads. The second part then considers the ASP paradigm itself, and describes the basic idea. It shows some programming techniques and briefly overviews Answer Set solvers. The third part is devoted to ASP in the context of the Semantic Web, presenting some formalisms and mentioning some applications in this area. The article concludes with issues of current and future ASP research.},

@article{Bittar2011,
abstract = {New technologies can often disrupt the balance between public and private interests in copyright law. For example, the Internet has facilitated the dissemination of artistic works by allowing users to mass distribute files within seconds. In response, the entertainment industry has turned to digital rights management (DRM) as one way of combating piracy. DRM is a technique that allows copyright owners to enforce their rights by controlling what users can do with their digital files, such as by restricting the platform on which the file can be accessed. In addition, the DRM scheme is protected by anti-circumvention laws, which prevent users from "breaking" the DRM. Although the main goal of DRMs is to prevent piracy, this technique can adversely impact other interests, such as privacy and fair use. This result is apparent in the e-book market, where it affects competition. More specifically, since each bookseller uses a different proprietary DRM scheme on their ebooks, compatible with a limited number of reading platforms, consumers face problems with interoperability. For example, a Kindle owner cannot buy books from Barnes {\&} Noble, and a Nook owner cannot buy books from Apple. This lack of interoperability can increase barriers to entry, switching costs, and network effects. Consequently, consumers are often locked into an e-book ecosystem, which permits booksellers to act as gatekeepers of the e-book market. Moreover, this situation can undermine the potential of e-books to spread knowledge, promote literacy, and extend the reach of literature. Examining the effects of DRM in the e-book market, this paper will discuss the equilibrium between three different public policies: the protection of copyrighted works, the promotion of market competition and the fostering of a free and robust cultural environment.},

abstract = {We present {\{}$\backslash$em smart drill-down{\}}, an operator for interactively exploring a relational table to discover and summarize "interesting" groups of tuples. Each group of tuples is described by a {\{}$\backslash$em rule{\}}. For instance, the rule {\$}(a, b, \backslashstar, 1000){\$} tells us that there are a thousand tuples with value {\$}a{\$} in the first column and {\$}b{\$} in the second column (and any value in the third column). Smart drill-down presents an analyst with a list of rules that together describe interesting aspects of the table. The analyst can tailor the definition of interesting, and can interactively apply smart drill-down on an existing rule to explore that part of the table. We demonstrate that the underlying optimization problems are {\{}$\backslash$sc NP-Hard{\}}, and describe an algorithm for finding the approximately optimal list of rules to display when the user uses a smart drill-down, and a dynamic sampling scheme for efficiently interacting with large tables. Finally, we perform experiments on real datasets on our experimental prototype to demonstrate the usefulness of smart drill-down and study the performance of our algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider Mark Bedau's notion of weak emer- gence (WE) and relate it to various attempts to objectively construe complexity. We argue that the heavy reliance on a specific notion of complexity risks rendering the concept superfluous. Furthermore we discuss what sort of systems might reasonably be understood as exhibiting emergence at all and point out that the macro-level needs to be at least min- imally structured. A worry may thus be formed that macro- level generalisations provide the sort of short-cut that is ex- plicitly excluded from WE thus potentially making the con- cept apply only to chaotic systems of limited interest (in this context).

@article{Pinelle2003,
abstract = {Researchers inComputerSupported CooperativeWorkhave recently developed discount evaluation methods for shared-workspace groupware. Most discount methods rely on some understanding of the context in which the groupware systems will be used, which means that evaluators need to model the tasks that groups will perform. However, existing task analysis schemes are not well suited to the needs of groupware evaluation: they either do not deal with collaboration issues, do not use an appropriate level of analysis for concrete assessment of usability in interfaces, or do not adequately represent the variability inherent in group work. To fill this gap, we have developed a new modeling technique called Collaboration Usability Analysis. CUA focuses on the teamwork that goes on in a group task rather than the taskwork. To enable closer links between the task representation and the groupware interface, CUA grounds each collaborative action in a set of group work primitives called the mechanics of collaboration. To represent the range of ways that a group task can be carried out, CUA allows variable paths through the execution of a task, and allows alternate paths and optional tasks to be modeled. CUA's main contribution is to provide evaluators with a framework in which they can simulate the realistic use of a groupware system and identify usability problems that are caused by the groupware interface.

More recently however, the importance of emotion in human-like intelligence and behaviour has been identified. This project aims at exploring this aspect of Artificial Intelligence by modeling the ability to display emotions in autonomous software agents within the constraints of a virtual environment. The motivation behind this is to determine whether the behaviour of these agents will cause the human participant to interact with the agent as if interacting with other humans. We have created an Agent-Cocktail Party World for this purpose and an Avatar-Cocktail Party World for the purpose of studying the psychological phenomenon of Ostracism. Our results show that the addition of an emotion-based intelligent component was able to make a statistically significant difference to the experimental condition by creating a more realistic environment in which to simulate the Punitive Ostracism condition.

In this work, we present a Wave Oriented Swarm Programming Paradigm (WOSPP) enabling the control of swarms with minimalistic communication bandwidth in a simple manner, yet allowing the emergence of diverse complex behaviors and autonomy of the swarm. Communi cation in the proposed paradigm is based on "ping"-signals inspired by strategies for communication and self organization of slime mold (dictyostelium discoideum) and fireflies (lampyridae). Signals propagate as information-waves throughout the swarm. We show that even with 1-bit bandwidth communication between agents suffices for the design of a substantial set of behaviors in the domain of essential behaviors of a collective. Ultimately, the reader will be enabled to develop and design a control scheme for individual swarms.},

abstract = {Routine activity theory states that criminal acts are caused due to the presence of criminals, victims and the absence of guardians in time and place. As the number of collision of these elements in place and time increases, criminal acts will also increase even if the number of criminals or civilians remains the same within the vicinity of a city. Street robbery is a typical example of daily crime and the occurrence of which can be predicted using routine activity theory. Agent-based models allow simulation of diversity among individuals. Therefore agent based simulation of street robbery can be used to visualize how chronological aspects of human activity influence the incidence of street robbery. The conceptual model identifies three classes of people- criminals, civilians and police with certain activity areas for each. Police exist only as agents of formal guardianship. Criminals with a tendency for crime will be in the search for their victims. Civilians without criminal tendency can be either victims or guardians. In addition to criminal tendency, each civilian in the model has a unique set of characteristics like wealth, employment status, ability for guardianship etc. These agents are subjected to random walk through a street environment guided by a Q – learning module and the possible outcomes are analyzed. The results include comparison of gang and single robberies, robberies made on kids and women and comparison of different guardian patrolling strategies.},

In recent interpretive consumer research, three research streams have emerged, each portraying how people consume through a distinctive metaphor: consuming as experience, consuming as integration, and consuming as classification. The research reported here-a two-year observational case study of baseball spectators in Chicago's Wrigley Field bleachers-builds on this literature to systematically detail the universe of actions that constitute consuming. The resulting typology refines, extends, and synthesizes the three existing approaches to consuming and adds a fourth dimension-consuming as play-to yield a comprehensive vocabulary for describing how consumers consume. The usefulness of the typology is demonstrated by applying it to develop an alternative conception of materialism as a style of consuming.},

This book contains 10 chapters, including Introduction to Grey Systems Theory, Basic Building Blocks of Grey Systems Theory, Grey Relationships, Grey Systems Modeling, Discrete Grey Prediction Models, Combined Grey Models, Grey Models for Decision Making, Grey Game Models, Grey Control, and others. It includes a computer software package developed for grey systems modeling. The contents, such as the axiomatic system of buffer operators and a series of weakening and strengthening operators, the axioms for measuring the greyness of grey numbers, the general grey incidences (grey absolute incidence, grey relative incidence, grey comprehensive incidence, grey analogy incidence, grey nearness incidence), discrete grey models, fixed weight grey cluster evaluation and grey evaluation methods based on triangular whitenization weight functions, multiattribute intelligent grey target decision models, the applicable range of the G(1,1) model, grey econometric models (G-E), grey Cobb-Douglass model (G-C-D), grey input-output model (G-I-O), grey Markov models (G-M), grey game models (GG), etc., are introduced by the authors the first time. This book will be appropriate as a reference and/or textbook for graduate students or high level undergraduate students, majoring in areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, astronomy, earth science, economics, and management. It can also be utilized as a reference book by researchers and technicians in research institutions, business entities, and government agencies.},

abstract = {In social psychology, emotional contagion describes the widely observed phenomenon of one person's emotions mimicking surrounding people's emotions [10]. In this paper, we perform a battery of experiments to explore the existence of agent-human emotional contagion. The first study is a between-subjects design, wherein subjects were shown an image of a character's face with either a neutral or happy expression. Findings indicate that even a still image induces a very strong increase in self-reported happiness between Neutral and Happy conditions with all characters tested. In a second study, we examine the effect of a virtual character's presence in a strategic decision by presenting subjects with a modernized Stag Hunt game. Our experiments show that the contagion effect is substantially dampened and does not cause a consistent impact on behavior. A third study explores the impact of the strategic situation within the Stag Hunt and conducts the same experiment using a description of the same strategic situation with the decision already made. We find that the emotional impact returns, implying that the contagion effect is substantially lessened in the presence of a strategic decision.},

abstract = {Multi-agent systems where the members are developed by parties with competing interests, and where there is no access to a member's internal state, are often classified as ‘open'. The specification of protocols for open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a design-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification modification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is often required to revise the specification during the protocol execution. To address this requirement, we present an infrastructure for ‘dynamic' protocol specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at runtime by agents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a modification of the ‘rules of the game' as well as decision-making over and enactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule modification by modelling dynamic specifications as metric spaces. Furthermore, we constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation criteria. We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a resourcesharing protocol, and an execution of this protocol in which the participating agents modify the protocol specification.},

abstract = {Modeling a city poses a number of problems to computer graphics. Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

To this aim, autonomous agents are increasingly used to implement the objects composing the scene. Although autonomy brings flexibility and realism in the animation, it has to be controlled in order to conform to the global behaviour targeted by the designer of the application. Multi-agent based organisational models are good candidates to specify "rights" and "duties" of agents with respect to the intended behaviour. In this paper we present MOISEInst, a meta-model aiming at representing normative organisations of agents according to four points of view: structural, functional, contextual and normative. We show how this model is suited to control an application of interactive TV game show where avatars are based on agents.},

States' similarity in cultural characteristics (such as ethnicity and political behavior) are strongly predictive of trade patterns. A substantial fraction of this association can be explained by a correlation between cultural markers and consumers' tastes. We also show that consumers are more likely to trade with dissimilar partners when the sellers have eBay's quality certification, providing suggestive evidence that consumers favor culturally similar trading partners because they infer higher seller quality. },

The main goal of this work is to develop artificial creatures, controlled by cognitive architectures, with different levels of machine consciousness. To fulfil this goal, we propose the application of cognitive neuroscience concepts to incrementally develop a cognitive architecture following the evolutionary steps taken by the animal brain. The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments. A completely codelet-based system “Core” has been implemented, serving the whole architecture.},

abstract = {Iterated games provide a framework to describe social interactions among groups of individuals. Recent work stimulated by the discovery of "zero-determinant" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such interactions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players face a simple binary choice, to "cooperate" or "defect". Real individuals, however, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social interaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access to a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social dynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some two-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible multi-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We also show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more "rugged " fitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple levels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on investments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are high. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose non-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and zero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that a large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by strategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed populations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity.},

abstract = {Extending the success of deep neural networks to natural language understanding and symbolic reasoning requires complex operations and external memory. Recent neural program induction approaches have attempted to address this problem, but are typically limited to differentiable memory, and consequently cannot scale beyond small synthetic tasks. In this work, we propose the Manager-Programmer-Computer framework, which integrates neural networks with non-differentiable memory to support abstract, scalable and precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. Specifically, we introduce a Neural Symbolic Machine, which contains a sequence-to-sequence neural "programmer", and a non-differentiable "computer" that is a Lisp interpreter with code assist. To successfully apply REINFORCE for training, we augment it with approximate gold programs found by an iterative maximum likelihood training process. NSM is able to learn a semantic parser from weak supervision over a large knowledge base. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WebQuestionsSP, a challenging semantic parsing dataset, with weak supervision. Compared to previous approaches, NSM is end-to-end, therefore does not rely on feature engineering or domain specific knowledge.},

abstract = {Studies a new method for integrating forward and backward chaining controls based on a Rete network. The authors introduce the concept of the hypothesis objects, and augment the production rule format by adding the hypothesis condition elements in the LHS part of a rule, which control the forward and backward chaining invocation of rules. To be applied to the backward chaining, a modified version of the Rete network has been formulated by adding the hypothesis-and-nodes and backward direction edges to the node network generated by the Rete algorithm. The authors then develop a backward chaining algorithm which takes advantage of already existing partial match results obtained by the previous forward chaining. The forward and backward chaining can be naturally integrated via the generation of hypotheses from forward chaining inference. The whole mixed inference process has the potential advantages over purely forward and backward chaining strategy},

These studies are important because they can investigate the neural correlates of processes that are difficult to study using laboratory stimuli, including: (i) complex constructive processes, (ii) recollective qualities of emotion and vividness, and (iii) remote memory retrieval. Constructing autobiographical memories involves search, monitoring and self-referential processes that are associated with activity in separable prefrontal regions. The contributions of emotion and vividness have been linked to the amygdala and visual cortex respectively. Finally, there is evidence that recent and remote autobiographical memories might activate the hippocampus equally, which has implications for memory-consolidation theories. The rapid development of innovative methods for eliciting personal memories in the scanner provides the opportunity to delve into the functional neuroanatomy of our personal past.},

@article{Rummery,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with practical issues surrounding the application of reinforcement learning techniques to tasks that take place in high dimensional continuous state-space environments. In particular, the extension of on-line updating methods is considered, where the term implies systems that learn as each experience arrives, rather than storing the experiences for use in a separate oo-line learning phase. Firstly, the use of alternative update rules in place of standard Q-learning (Watkins 1989) is examined to provide faster convergence rates. Secondly, the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks (Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams 1986) is investigated to provide suitable generalising function approximators. Finally, consideration is given to the combination of Adaptive Heuristic Critic (AHC) methods and Q-learning to produce systems combining the beneets of real-valued actions and discrete switching. The diierent update rules examined are based on Q-learning combined with the TD() algorithm (Sutton 1988). Several new algorithms, including Modiied Q-Learning and Summation Q-Learning, are examined, as well as alternatives such a s Q () (P eng and Williams 1994). In addition, algorithms are presented for applying these Q-learning up-dates to train MLPs on-line during trials, as opposed to the backward-replay m e t h o d u s e d by Lin (1993b) that requires waiting until the end of each trial before updating can occur. The performance of the update rules is compared on the Race Track problem of Barto, Bradtke and Singh (1993) using a lookup table representation for the Q-function. Some of the methods are found to perform almost as well as Real-Time Dynamic Programming, despite the fact that the latter has the advantage of a full world model. The performance of the connectionist algorithms is compared on a larger and more complex robot navigation problem. Here a simulated mobile robot is trained to guide itself to a goal position in the presence of obstacles. The robot must rely on limited sensory feedback from its surroundings and make decisions that can be generalised to arbitrary layouts of obstacles. These simulations show that the performance of on-line learning algorithms is less sensitive to the choice of training parameters than backward-replay, and that the alternative Q-learning rules of Modiied Q-Learning and Q() a r e more robust than standard Q-learning updates. Finally, a c o m bination of real-valued AHC and Q-learning, called Q-AHC learning, is presented, and various architectures are compared in performance on the robot prob-lem. The resulting reinforcement learning system has the properties of providing on-line training, parallel computation, generalising function approximation, and continuous vector actions.

abstract = {Social cognitive theory (SCT) is among the most influential theories of behavior change and has been used as the conceptual basis of health behavior interventions for smoking cessation, weight management, and other health behaviors. SCT and other behavior theories were developed primarily to explain differences between individuals, but explanatory theories of within-person behavioral variability are increasingly needed as new technologies allow for intensive longitudinal measures and interventions adapted from these inputs. These within-person explanatory theoretical applications can be modeled as dynamical systems. SCT constructs, such as reciprocal determinism, are inherently dynamical in nature, but SCT has not been modeled as a dynamical system. This paper describes the development of a dynamical system model of SCT using fluid analogies and control systems principles drawn from engineering. Simulations of this model were performed to assess if the model performed as predicted based on theory and empirical studies of SCT. This initial model generates precise and testable quantitative predictions for future intensive longitudinal research. Dynamic modeling approaches provide a rigorous method for advancing health behavior theory development and refinement and for guiding the development of more potent and efficient interventions.},

abstract = {Focusing on Caribana, an annual Caribbean festival in Toronto, this paper explores the political significance of street festivals and related events. Based on field observation, interviews and archival research in Toronto, the paper makes some comparisons between Caribana and similar events in Britain and other parts of the Afro-Caribbean diaspora. It situates an analysis of Caribana within the context of Canada's official commitment to multiculturalism arguing that this policy defines the terms and sets the limits of the political potential of Caribana which its participants constantly threaten to transgress. Various territorial issues are central to the political and social geography of Caribana, including the routing (and re-routing) of the parade and the strategies of 'containment' used to police the parade and associated festivities. The paper argues that through its limited financial commitment to Caribana the state restricts the legitimate expression of cultural difference, exposing the contradictions of official multiculturalist rhetoric. The paper begins and ends with some broader reflections on the political significance of street festivals in the context of an increasingly post-colonial, postmodern world. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Accordingly we expose the deep relationship between computer languages and continuous expression, examining how these realms may support one another, and how the artist-programmer may fully engage with both. Our argument takes us up through layers of representation, starting with symbols, then words, language and notation, to consider the role that these representations may play in human creativity. We form a cross-disciplinary perspective from psychology, computer science, linguistics, human-computer interaction, computational creativity, music technology and the arts. We develop and demonstrate the potential of this view to inform arts practice, through the practical introduction of software prototypes, artworks, programming languages and improvised performances. In particular, we introduce works which demonstrate the role of perception in symbolic semantics, embed the representation of time in programming language, include visuospatial arrangement in syntax, and embed the activity of programming in the improvisation and experience of art.},

This project was initiated with a collection of handmade drawings that share the common characteristic of being similar but never identical. This resemblance with a biological population of individuals, led us to its usage with the Evolutionary Sound Synthesis methodology. From each drawing we retrieved sonic features that were represented by a subpatch into the Pd system implementation. As Pd allows the development of patch generating other patches, this system acts as if they are individuals artificially living inside a population, were they grow, reproduced and eventually dye. This paper describes the technical aspects of RePartitura implementation; the mapping of drawings into sonic features, the design and breeding of individuals and the final sonic result of all individuals coexisting within the population, thus leading to the self-organization of dynamically evolving soundscapes.},

Existing transformation systems either do not guarantee the avoidance of variable capture or impair the implementation of transformations. We present an algorithm called name-fix that automatically eliminates variable capture from a generated program by systematically renaming variables. name-fix is guided by a graph representation of the binding structure of a program, and requires name-resolution algorithms for the source language and the target language of a transformation. name-fix is generic and works for arbitrary transformations in any transformation system that supports origin tracking for names. We verify the correctness of name-fix and identify an interesting class of transformations for which name-fix provides hygiene. We demonstrate the applicability of name-fix for implementing capture-avoiding substitution, inlining, lambda lifting, and compilers for two domain-specific languages.},

abstract = {Although AI and HCI explore computing and intelligent behavior and the fields have seen some cross-over, until recently there was not very much. This article outlines a history of the fields that identifies some of the forces that kept the fields at arm's length. AI was generally marked by a very ambitious, long-term vision requiring expensive systems, although the term was rarely envisioned as being as long as it proved to be, whereas HCI focused more on innovation and improvement of widely-used hardware within a short time-scale. These differences led to different priorities, methods, and assessment approaches. A consequence was competition for resources, with HCI flourishing in AI winters and moving more slowly when AI was in favor. The situation today is much more promising, in part because of platform convergence: AI can be exploited on widely-used systems.},

@book{Parkinson1999,
abstract = {Volume III is devoted to the Middle Ages. It considers the rich traditions of Arab, Jewish and Latin philosophy, which began to flourish in the ninth century and continued, in the Latin West, until the early seventeenth century. Among the philosophers treated in detail are Avicenna and Averroes, Maimonides, Eriugena, Anselm, Abelard, Grosseteste, Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, Peter Aureoli, William of Ockham, Wyclif and Su{\'{a}}rez. An introductory chapter discusses Boethius, the late antique thinker who was enormously influential in the medieval Latin West. Special attention has been given to many lesser-known, but important figures in each period, as well as to medieval logic and to the cultural context of medieval philosophy, both in Islam and the Christian West. This volume provides a comprehensive analysis of the main areas of medieval philosophy by the experts in each field. It offers fresh perspectives on a complex and rapidly changing area of research, in which Arab and Jewish philosophy are considered in their own right, rather than as sources for Latin thinkers, and the thirteenth century (the time of Aquinas) is not viewed as dominating the earlier and later parts of the period.},

abstract = {Up-to techniques are used to make it easier—or feasible—to construct, for instance, proofs of bisimilarity. This text shows how many up-to techniques can be framed as size-preserving functions, using sized types to keep track of sizes. Through a number of examples it is argued that this approach to up-to techniques is often convenient to use in practice. Some examples of functions that cannot be made size-preserving are also included, in order to illustrate the limits of the approach. On the more theoretical side a class of up-to techniques intended to capture a natural mode of use of size-preserving functions is defined. This class turns out to correspond closely to " functions below the companion " , a notion recently introduced by Pous.},

abstract = {Design patterns have proven useful in many creative fields, providing content creators with archetypal, reusable guidelines to leverage in projects. Creating such patterns, however, is a time-consuming, manual process, typically relegated to a few experts in any given domain. In this paper, we describe an algorithmic method for learning design patterns directly from data using techniques from natural language processing and structured concept learning. Given a set of labeled, hierarchical designs as input, we induce a probabilistic formal grammar over these exemplars. Once learned, this grammar encodes a set of generative rules for the class of designs, which can be sampled to synthesize novel artifacts. We demonstrate the method on geometric models and Web pages, and discuss how the learned patterns can drive new interaction mechanisms for content creators. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {The idea of planning and plan execution is just an intuition based decomposition. There is no reason it has to be that way. Most likely in the long term, real empirical evidence from systems we know to be built that way (from designing them like that) will determine whether its a very good idea or not. Any particular planner is simply an abstraction barrier. Below that level we get a choice of whether to slot in another planner or to place a program which does the right thing. Why stop there? Maybe we can go up the hierarchy and eliminate the planners there too. To do this we must move from a state based way of reasoning to a process based way of acting.},

abstract = {The recovery from the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-09 has been sluggish in the United States and more so in a number of other developed countries. This has given rise to a literature about possible secular stagnation (Gordon 2012, 2014; Krugman 2014; Summers 2014; Ball, DeLong, and Summers 2014; and Ball 2014). This paper proposes an approach to explaining the current stagnation that differs from that found in the above literature. We will argue that the current stagnation stems from the effect of the institutional structure of the economy on long-run macroeconomic performance. This explanation for the current stagnation is based on the social structure of accumulation (SSA) theory (Gordon, 1980; Gordon, Edwards, and Reich, 1982, chapter 2; Kotz et al 1994; and McDonough et al, 2010), which is explained below.},

The object of the paper is to provide enhanced insights in the opportunities and barriers ICT holds within these negotiations. The paper draws on a qualitative interview study which explores the significance of ICT in the everyday lives of 23 disabled Norwegian youth, aged 15?20 years. The analysis of the data material is inspired by the principles in constructivist grounded theory. This paper illuminates how the widespread dissemination of ICT involves complex dependencies and mechanisms of exclusion and marginalization of disabled youth, as well as inclusion. The access to ICT, and provision of ICT assistive devices, do not necessarily provide usable and suitable ICT, and this leaves some disabled youth at a neglected dead end which excludes them from their peer group.},

We then describe a study which assessed the responses of naive users to output that varied along two dimensions: the method of describing an assembly plan (pre-order or post-order), and the method of referring to objects in the world (basic and full). Varying both of these factors produced significant results: sub- jects using the system that employed a pre-order description strategy asked for instructions to be repeated significantly less often than those who experienced the post-order strategy, while the subjects who heard references generated by the full reference strategy judged the robot's instructions to be significantly more understandable than did those who heard the output of the basic strategy.},

abstract = {Videogames require robust yet flexible methods and vocabularies of critical analysis that appreciate both the textual and embodied pleasures of players. Such analysis cannot start with the players intentions as an autonomous user nor with the videogame as a stable object; rather, it must account for the dynamic interplay between videogame hardware, sensorial perception, and audiovisual and haptic representations. If it is to understand how a particular videogame is engaged as both textual artefact and embodied practice, such analysis must be concerned with not just what the player does with the videogame, but what the videogame does with the player.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis thesis forwards a phenomenology of videogame experience to account for how the player and the videogame incorporate each other in reflexive cycles that mediate presence, attention, perception, and agency. It does not hope to understand videogames either 'as narratives' or 'as games' but as particular amalgamations of existing and nascent media and forms—it hopes to understand videogames as videogames. It explores videogame play as a convergence of eyes-on-screens, ears-at-speakers, and muscles-against-interfaces to interrogate the limits of current game studies approaches that often obscure rich commonalities between videogames and other media forms. Drawing upon phenomenology, posthumanism, and cyborg theory, and embedded in detailed and multifaceted analyses of various videogames on different platforms as played, this thesis develops nuanced understandings of how the player and the videogame come together during play to form particular modes of embodiment through which a videogame work is both interpreted and perceived.},

We put forward a characterisation of these systems and introduce some conceptual distinctions that may help to plot the work ahead. In particular, we propose a tripartite view that highlights the interplay between the institutional models that prescribe the behaviour of participants, the corre- sponding implementation of these prescriptions and the actual performance of the system. Building on this tripartite view we explore the problem of developing a conceptual framework for modelling this type of systems and howthat framework can be supported by technological artefacts that implement the resulting models. The last section of this position paper is a list of challenges that we believe are worth facing. This work draws upon the contributions that the MAS community has made to the understanding and realization of the concepts of coordination, norms and institutions from an organisational perspective.},

abstract = {Being happy or sad influences the content and style of thought. One explanation is that affect serves as information about the value of whatever comes to mind. Thus, when a person makes evaluative judgments or engages in a task, positive affect can enhance evaluations and empower potential responses. Rather than affect itself, the information conveyed by affect is crucial. Tests of the hypothesis find that affective influences can be made to disappear by changing the source to which the affect is attributed. In tasks, positive affect validates and negative affect invalidates accessible cognitions, leading to relational processing and item-specific processing, respectively. Positive affect is found to promote, and negative affect to inhibit, many textbook phenomena from cognitive psychology.},

@article{Hastie2009,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

The visualization method uses a combination of both semantical and geometrical distortions, while the layout is generated by a spring embedder algorithm using recently developed force model.

@book{Lessig,
abstract = {The Internet revolution has come. Some say it has gone. What was responsible for its birth? Who is responsible for its demise? In The Future of Ideas, Lawrence Lessig explains how the Internet revolution has produced a counterrevolution of devastating power and effect. The explosion of innovation we have seen in the environment of the Internet was not conjured from some new, previously unimagined technological magic; instead, it came from an ideal as old as the nation. Creativity flourished there because the Internet protected an innovation commons. The Internets very design built a neutral platform upon which the widest range of creators could experiment. The legal architecture surrounding it protected this free space so that culture and informationthe ideas of our eracould flow freely and inspire an unprecedented breadth of expression. But this structural design is changingboth legally and technically. This shift will destroy the opportunities for creativity and innovation that the Internet originally engendered. The cultural dinosaurs of our recent past are moving to quickly remake cyberspace so that they can better protect their interests against the future. Powerful conglomerates are swiftly using both law and technology to "tame" the Internet, transforming it from an open forum for ideas into nothing more than cable television on speed. Innovation, once again, will be directed from the top down, increasingly controlled by owners of the networks, holders of the largest patent portfolios, and, most invidiously, hoarders of copyrights. The choice Lawrence Lessig presents is not between progress and the status quo. It is between progress and a new Dark Ages, in which our capacity to create is confined by an architecture of control and a society more perfectly monitored and filtered than any before in history. Important avenues of thought and free expression will increasingly be closed off. The door to a future of ideas is being shut just as technology makes an extraordinary future possible. With an uncanny blend of knowledge, insight, and eloquence, Lawrence Lessig has written a profoundly important guide to the care and feeding of innovation in a connected world. Whether it proves to be a road map or an elegy is up to us.},

As such, counterfactual mind-sets were expected to improve performance on tasks involving the consideration of relationships and associations but to impair performance on tasks requiring novel ideas that are uninfluenced by salient associations. The authors conducted several experiments to test this hypothesis. In Experiments 1a and 1b, the authors determined that counterfactual mind-sets increase mental states and preferences for thinking styles consistent with relational thought. Experiment 2 demonstrated a facilitative effect of counterfactual mind-sets on an analytic task involving logical relationships; Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that counterfactual mind-sets structure thought and imagination around salient associations and therefore impaired performance on creative generation tasks. In Experiment 5, the authors demonstrated that the detrimental effect of counterfactual mind-sets is limited to creative tasks involving novel idea generation; in a creative association task involving the consideration of relationships between task stimuli, counterfactual mind-sets improved performance.},

abstract = {Successful algorithmic music composition requires the efficient creation of works that reflect human preferences. In examining this key issue, we make two main contributions in this dissertation: analysis of the computational complexity of algorithmic music composition, and methods to produce music that approximates a commendable human effort. We use species counterpoint as our compositional model, wherein a set of stylistic and grammatical rules governs the search for suitable countermelodies to match a given melody. Our analysis of the complexity of rule-based music composition considers four different types of computational problems: decision, enumeration, number, and optimization. For restricted versions of the decision problem, we devise a polynomial algorithm by constructing a non-deterministic finite state transducer. This transducer can also solve corresponding restricted versions of the enumeration and number problems. The general forms of the four types of problems, however, are respectively NP- complete, {\#}P-complete, NP-complete in the strong sense, and NP-equivalent. We prove this by first reducing from the well known Three-Dimensional Matching problem to the music composition decision problem, and then by reducing among the music problems themselves. In order to compose music both correct and human-like, we formulate new “artistry” rules to supplement traditional rules of musical style and grammar. We also propose the fuzzy application of these artistry rules, to complement the crisp application of the traditional rules. We then suggest two methods to model human preferences: (1) distinguish an expert's compositions from alternative compositions by determining rule weights; (2) train an artificial neural network to reflect an expert's musical preferences through the latter's evaluations of a set of compositions. We were able to approximate that elusive factor of human preference with better than 75{\%} accuracy. To solve the optimization problem, we adapt two different search algorithms: best-first search with branch-and-bound pruning (for m ≥ 1 optimal solutions), and a genetic algorithm (for m ≥ 1 near- optimal solutions). Through these algorithms, we test the techniques of rule weightings and of trained neural networks as evaluation functions. Our adaptation of the genetic algorithm produced optimal countermelodies in execution time favorably comparable to that taken by the best-first algorithm.},

Digital games are increasingly prevalent in today's classrooms, and game-based learning is emerging as a successful means of reaching students who often struggle to succeed through more traditional approaches. For example, students with autism face a unique set of challenges and goals in the context of classroom learning. Principles of well-designed games offer a powerful framework for designing new types of learning experiences for students with autism. Moreover, recent innovations in computing interfaces have also lead to new forms of socio-collaborative experiences with digital media. This article introduces our recent case study in applying game-based learning in Special Education. We will present the learning scenario goals and implementation, focusing on how this work successfully applied well-designed game principles to this context.

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of defining social roles in multi-agent systems. Social roles provide the basic structure of social institutions and organizations. We start from the properties attributed to roles both in the multi-agent systems and the Object Oriented community, and we use them in an ontological analysis of the notion of social role. We identify three main properties of social roles. First, they are definitionally dependent on the institution they belong to, i.e. the definition of a role is given inside the definition of the institution. Second, they attribute powers to the agents playing them, like creating commitments for the institutions and the other roles. Third, they allow roles to play roles, in the same way as agents do. Using Input/Output logics, we propose a formalization of roles in multi-agent systems satisfying the three properties we identified.In this paper we address the problem of defining social roles in multi-agent systems.

@article{Winner2003,
abstract = {In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more pro vocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities. At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and pro ductivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.1 Writing in Technology and Culture almost two decades ago, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one version of the theme, arguing that "from late neo lithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable."2 This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city, architecture, and the his tory of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other nineteenth century critics of industrial ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, "The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state." Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that "dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism."3 An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is by no means the exclusive property of critics of large-scale high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the "biggest and best" that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice. The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, the space program, and of course nuclear power itself have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces. David Lilienthal, in T.V.A.: Democracy on the March, for example, found this promise in the phos 121 This content downloaded from 144.82.108.120 on Mon,},

abstract = {Cooking typically involves a plethora of decisions about ingredients and tools that need to be chosen in order to write a good cooking recipe. Cooking can be modelled in an optimization framework, as it involves a search space of ingredients, kitchen tools, cooking times or temperatures. If we model as an objective function the quality of the recipe, several problems arise. No analytical expression can model all the recipes, so no gradients are available. The objective function is subjective , in other words, it contains noise. Moreover, evaluations are expensive both in time and human resources. Bayesian Optimization (BO) emerges as an ideal methodology to tackle problems with these characteristics. In this paper, we propose a methodology to suggest recipe recommendations based on a Machine Learning (ML) model that fits real and simulated data and BO. We provide empirical evidence with two experiments that support the adequacy of the methodology.},

Its central theme is that organizational knowledge is created through a continuous dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge. The nature of this dialogue is examined and four patterns of interaction involving tacit and explicit knowledge are identified. It is argued that while new knowledge is developed by individuals, organizations play a critical role in articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical framework is developed which provides an analytical per- spective on the constituent dimensions of knowledge cre- ation. This framework is then applied in two operational models for facilitating the dynamic creation of appropriate organizational knowledge.},

@article{Lorini2009,
abstract = {In the recent years, several formal approaches to the specification of normative multi-agent systems (MASs) and artificial institutions have been proposed. The aim of this article is to advance the state of the art in this area by proposing an approach in which a normative MAS is conceived to be autonomous, in the sense that it is able to create, maintain and eventually change its own institutions by itself, without the intervention of an external designer in this process. In our approach the existence and the dynamics of an institution (norms, rules, institutional facts, etc.) are determined by the (individual and collective) acceptances of its members, and its dynamics depends on the dynamics of these acceptances. In order to meet this objective, we propose the logic [A][L] (Acceptance Logic) in which the acceptance of a proposition by the agents qua members of an institution is introduced. Such propositions are true w.r.t. an institutional context and correspond to facts that are instituted in an attitude-dependent way. The second part of the article is devoted to the logical characterization of some important notions in the theory of institutions. We provide a formalization of the concept of constitutive rule, expressed by a statement of the form X counts as Y in the context of institution x'. Then, we formalize the concepts of obligation and permission (so called regulative rules). In our approach, constitutive rules and regulative rules of a certain institution are attitude-dependent facts which are grounded on the acceptances of the members of the institution.},

The state of an agent consists of components such as beliefs, decisions, capabilities, and obligations; for this reason the state of an agent is called its mental state. The mental state of agents is described formally in an extension of standard epistemic logics: beside temporalizing the knowledge and belief operators, AOP introduces operators for obligation, decision, and capability. Agents are controlled by agent programs, which include primitives for communicating with other agents. In the spirit of speech act theory, each communication primitive is of a certain type: informing, requesting, offering, and so on. This article presents the concept of AOP, discusses the concept of mental state and its formal underpinning, defines a class of agent interpreters, and then describes in detail a specific interpreter that has been implemented. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Data from the 2002 Religion and Public Activism Survey were used to examine relationships among measures of religious orientation, embeddedness in social networks and the level of trust individuals direct toward others. Results from ordered logistic regression analysis demonstrate that Catholics and members of other denominations show signifi cantly less trust in strangers than mainline Protestants, while older persons and those who are more trusting of acquaintances show greater trust. Although measures of personal religiosity and activity within a congregation show no statistically signifi cant relationship to trust once important controls are taken into account, measures of embeddedness within secular social networks do.},

abstract = {Can international human rights help guide and govern artificial intelligence (AI)? Currently, much of society is uncertain about the real human impacts of AI systems. Amid hopes that AI can bring forth "global good" there is evidence that some AI systems are already violating fundamental rights and freedoms. As stakeholders look for a North Star to guide AI development, we can rely on human rights to help chart the course ahead. International human rights are a powerful tool for identifying, preventing , and redressing an important class of risks and harms. A human rights-based frame could provide those developing AI with the aspirational, normative, and legal guidance to uphold human dignity and the inherent worth of every individual regardless of country or jurisdiction. Simply put: In order for AI to benefit the common good, at the very least its design and deployment should avoid harms to fundamental human values. International human rights provide a robust and global formulation of those values. This report is intended as a resource for anyone working in the field of AI and gover-nance. It is also intended for those in the human rights field, outlining why they should be concerned about the present-day impacts of AI. What follows translates between},

@article{Cohen2013,
abstract = {How are tasks bundled into and across jobs within organizations? In this paper, I develop a model of this process of job design by drawing on a multisite qualitative study of task allocation following the installation of a DNA sequencer. The model that emerges is one of the assembly of tasks through multiple subassembly processes with multiple assemblers. Four activities produced requirements and requests for job designs and propositions about how to meet these: actively searching, passively receiving, doing work, and invoking preexisting ideas. The ideas that emerge from these processes are further transformed through reconciliation, interpretation, and performance. My observations show that this overall process is far reaching and incorporates many elements, not all of which are explicitly intended for job designs. The arrangements that emerge from this process are not the product of a deliberate and controlled job design process within the boundaries of a single organization.

abstract = {In this paper we focus on the problem of dialog act (DA) labelling. This problem has recently attracted a lot of attention as it is an important sub-part of an automatic dialog model, which is currently in great demand. Traditional methods tend to see this problem as a sequence labelling task and deal with it by applying classifiers with rich features. Most of the current neural network models still omit the sequential information in the conversation. Henceforth, we apply a novel multi-level gated recurrent neural network (GRNN) with non-textual information to predict the DA tag. Our model not only utilizes textual information, but also makes use of non-textual and contextual information. In comparison, our model has shown significant improvement over previous works on the Switchboard Dialog Act (SWDA) data by over 6{\%}.},

@article{Caramazza2006,
abstract = {Cognitive neuropsychology began in the second half of the nineteenth century. The cognitive neuropsychologists were also cognitive neuroscientists: They were interested not only in the functional architecture of cognition, but also in how the components of such an architecture were localized in the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is the study of those neural systems of the brain that subserve cognition, and so it is a branch of neuroscience. The view of cognitive neuropsychology as a branch of cognitive psychology and as distinct from cognitive neuroscience is widely accepted. Characteristic of cognitive neuropsychology is that it studies symptoms rather than syndromes and carries out single case studies rather than group studies. Some patients with agrammatic sentence constructions are impaired at the use of function words but not at the use of affixes, whereas others show the opposite dissociation. This is one reason why cognitive neuropsychologists study symptoms, not syndromes. The number of possible different shapes for snowflakes is so large that the likelihood of obtaining two snowflakes with the same morphology is quite small, which makes the prospect of group studies of snowflake morphology an impractical one. The papers in this volume show that computational modelling is rapidly becoming important in cognitive neuropsychology. As already noted, cognitive neuropsychology can be considered a branch of cognitive psychology where subjects' performance is used to inform theories of normal cognition. However, as also already noted, there is increasing interest in relating cognitive neuropsychological investigations to developments in cognitive neuroscience.

It provides salient information about the food miles for various scanned food items represented by varying lengths of lit LEDs on the handle and a changing emoticon comparing the average miles of all the products in the trolley against a social norm. When evaluated in situ, the lambent handle display nudged people to choose products with fewer food miles than the items they selected using their ordinary shopping strategies. People also felt guilty when the average mileage of the contents of their entire shopping trolley was above the social norm. The findings are discussed in terms of how to provide different kinds of product information that people care about, using simple lambent displays.},

abstract = {By mid-1998, approximately 200 different controlled experiments had been published in 230 articles in refereed journals or major conference proceedings, which examined processes and outcomes in computer-supported group decision making. This paper is a concise overview of what has been studied and how: the systems, independent, intervening, adaptation, and dependent variables, manipulated or measured, and experimental procedures employed. Part I categorizes the contextual and intervening factors. Part II analyzes 1,582 hypotheses resulting from pairings of independent and dependent variables. The results show that the modal outcome for group support systems (GSS) compared with face-to-face (FtF) methods is "no difference," while the overall percentage of positive effects for hypotheses that compare GSS with FtF is a disappointing 16.6 percent. Experiments with seven to ten groups per treatment condition working on idea-generation tasks and using GSS technology show an improvement up to 29.0 percent. These results are moderated by technology, process structure, communication mode, group factors, task type, the number of experimental groups per treatment condition, and the type of dependent variable measured. The purpose of this paper is to aid the GSS researcher by presenting detailed results of what has been studied and found in previous experiments, along with a discussion of what needs to be studied.

abstract = {We introduce a new semantics for a logic of explicit and implicit beliefs based on the concept of multi-agent belief base. Differently from existing Kripke-style semantics for epistemic logic in which the notions of possible world and doxastic/epistemic alternative are primitive, in our semantics they are non-primitive but are defined from the concept of belief base. We provide a complete axiomatization and prove decidability for our logic via a finite model argument. We also provide a polynomial embedding of our logic into Fagin {\&} Halpern's logic of general awareness and establish a complexity result for our logic via the embedding.},

abstract = {Goats have always been considered very useful animals. Goats success is related to its excellent adaptability to the diicult mountain conditions, extreme weather and low value feed acceptance, versatile habits and high production considering their size. These are some reasons because goats are among the irst animals to be domesticated. In terms of evolution, goats could be separated by their dispersion area in three large groups: the European, the Asian, and the African. Global goat populations, mainly in Africa and in Asia, have increased for centuries but very strongly in the past decades, well above the world population growth. They are also used for forest grazing, an integrated and alter- native production system, very useful to control weed growth reducing ire risk. Despite some exceptions, no large‐scale efort to professionalize this industry has been made so far. There are consumers for goat dairy products and there is enough global production, but misses a professional network between both. Regarding goat meat, the world leader- ship also stays in Africa and Asia, namely in China, and there is a new phenomenon, the spreading of goat meat tradition through Europe due to migrants from Africa and other places with strong goat meat consumption.},

abstract = {A brief display that is clearly visible when shown alone can be rendered invisible by the subsequent presentation of a second visual stimulus. Several recently described backward masking effects are not predicted by current theories of visual masking, including masking by four small dots that surround (but do not touch) a target object and masking by a surrounding object that remains on display after the target object has been turned off. A crucial factor in both of these effects is attention: almost no masking occurs if attention can be rapidly focused on the target, whereas powerful masking ensues if attention directed at the target is delayed. A new theory of visual masking, inspired by developments in neuroscience, can account for these effects, as well as more traditional masking effects. In addition, the new theory sheds light on related research, such as the attentional blink, inattentional blindness and change blindness.},

@article{Piketty2013,
abstract = {The second pattern, represented in Figure I.2, reflects a divergence mechanism that is in some ways simpler and more transparent and no doubt exerts greater influence on the long-run evolution of the wealth distribution. Figure I.2 shows the total value of private wealth (in real estate, financial assets, and professional capital, net of debt) in Britain, France and Germany, expressed in years of national income, for the period 1870–2010. Note, first of all, the very high level of private wealth in Europe in the late nineteenth century: the total amount of private wealth hovered around six or seven years of national income, which is a lot. It then fell sharply in response to the shocks of the period 1914–1945: the capital/income ratio decreased to just 2 or 3. We then observe a steady rise from 1950 on, a rise so sharp that private fortunes in the early twenty-first century seem to be on the verge of returning to five or six years of national income in both Britain and France. (Private wealth in Germany, which started at a lower level, remains lower, but the upward trend is just as clear.) This " U-shaped curve " reflects an absolutely crucial transformation, which will figure largely in this study. In particular, I will show that the return of high capital/income ratios over the past few decades can be explained in large part by the return to a regime of relatively slow growth. In slowly growing economies, past wealth naturally takes on disproportionate importance, because it takes only a small flow of new savings to increase the stock of wealth steadily and substantially. If, moreover, the rate of return on capital remains significantly above the growth rate for an extended period of time (which is more likely when the growth rate is low, though not automatic), then the risk of divergence in the distribution of wealth is very high.},

We describe integrated algorithms, and a tool capable of translating a high-level concept for a tactical military operation into a fully detailed, actionable plan, producing automatically (or with human guidance) plans with realistic degree of detail and of human-like quality. Tight interleaving of several algorithms -- planning, adversary estimates, scheduling, routing, attrition and consumption estimates -- comprise the computational approach of this tool. Although originally developed for Army large-unit operations, the technology is generic and also applies to a number of other domains, particularly in critical situations requiring detailed planning within a constrained period of time. In this paper, we focus particularly on the engineering tradeoffs in the design of the tool. In an experimental evaluation, reminiscent of the Turing test, the tool's performance compared favorably with human planners},

abstract = {Part of Academia's motivation for improving agent-based languages and architectures is the hope that some of its solutions might be, one day, adopted by the videogame industry for specification of agents' behavior. However, the games industry already employs its own techniques for that purpose. Thus we need rigorous empirical data to provide an insight to the expected utility of academic solutions and pinpoint their most promising features. Game pro-grammers often face situations when they have to understand and modify the work of current or former colleagues, or to extend their own work from months or even years ago. Thus, one way an academia's solution could provide value would be that it outperforms the industry's typical approach under these circumstances - offering better code readability and maintainability. Here we present results of an empirical study modeling this problem. We adopt Java programming as the industry approach (modeling scripting) and choose the POSH reactive planner as an academic approach. We engaged 22 computer science students attending a university course on virtual agents on two programming assignments, in which they had to produce specific high-level behaviors of 3D virtual agents solving different game-like tasks. First, students had to produce the behavior of a particular task from scratch. Second, these behaviors were used in an assignment where students had to extend the behavior coded by someone else. Finally, three months later, 8 of these students were told to extend their own behavior they coded in the first assignment. The quantitative results indicate that Java is as good as POSH in terms of subjective programmers' preference and that there is no objective difference between qualities of created behaviors. The qualitative results suggest several useful but also troublesome features of POSH, some of which are shared by other languages, suggesting possible improvements.},

FAS 123-R required firms to begin expensing option compensation in income statements, instead of disclosing costs only in footnotes. We exploit that FAS 123-R's compliance dates were staggered quasi-randomly based on firms' fiscal year ends. Firms that expensed options were more likely to miss earnings forecast, relative to firms that did not yet expense options. Analysts also more often revised down these firms' recommendations, resulting in large market value drops. Our results are consistent with the limited attention hypothesis: Analysts and investors overvalue firms when value-relevant information is less accessible.},

The Parsec parser combinator library described in this paper, utilizes a novel implementation technique for space and time efficient parser combinators that in case of a parse error, report both the position of the error as well as all grammar productions that would have been legal at that point in the input.},

@article{Castelfranchi2003,
abstract = {The goal of this paper is to show the normative component of a convention adopted by a population of cognitive agents. To address this aim we will defend two distinct thesis. The former is that even simple predictions developed to anticipate future state of affairs have an intrinsic tendency to evolve in full expectations and then in prescriptions. We consider this as a multilevel phenomenon occurring either at the individual psychological level or at the interpersonal one or, finally, at the collective macro social level. The latter thesis is that we consider this tendency as one of the possible paths of the spontaneous emergence of agents commitments, of conventions and likely of real social norms: the tacit emergence of a prescriptive character and, then, of obligations and duties. We will examine the constitutive elements both cognitive and relational  of this process of spontaneous transition from the predictive attitudes to the prescriptive ones and, on this basis, to real normative attitudes. Finally, we will discuss the inevitably normative component of conventions as traditionally described (Lewis 1969). We will argue that this fundamental process is notably left implicit or insufficiently explained.},

abstract = {Several innovative software applications such as those required by ambient intelligence, the semantic grid, e-commerce and e-marketing, can be viewed as open soci- eties of heterogeneous and self-interested agents in which social order is achieved through norms. For agents to par- ticipate in these kinds of societies, it is enough that they are able to represent and fulfill norms, and to recog- nise the authority of certain agents. However, to volun- tarily be part of a society or to voluntarily leave it, other characteristics of agents are needed. To find these char- acteristics we observe that on the one hand, autonomous agents have their own goals and, sometimes, they act on be- half of others whose goals must be satisfied. On the other, we observe that by being members, agents must com- ply with some norms that can be in clear conflict with their goals. Consequently, agents must evaluate the pos- itive or negative effects of norms on their goals before making a decision concerning their social behaviour. Pro- viding a model of autonomous agents that make this kind of norm reasoning is the aim of this paper},

abstract = {A useful pattern in dependently typed programming is to define a state transition system, for example the states and operations in a network protocol, as a parameterised monad. We index each operation by its input and output states, thus guaranteeing that operations satisfy preand postconditions, by typechecking. However, what if we want to write a program using several systems at once? What if we want to define a high level state transition system, such as a network application protocol, in terms of lower level states, such as network sockets and mutable variables? In this paper, I present an architecture for dependently typed applications based on a hierarchy of state transition systems, implemented as a library called states. Using states, I show: how to implement a state transition system as a dependent type, with type level guarantees on its operations; how to account for operations which could fail; how to combine state transition systems into a larger system; and, how to implement larger systems as a hierarchy of state transition systems. As an example, I implement a simple high level network application protocol.},

In the past, technological advances such as improved graphics and new controllers have driven the creation of new forms of gameplay, but games have still not made great strides into new gameplay experiences. We argue that the development of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) systems plays a crucial role in the exploration of currently unreachable spaces. To aid in exploration, we suggest a practice called AI-based game design, an iterative design process that deeply integrates the affordances of an AI system within the context of game design. We have applied this process in our own projects, and in this paper we present how it has pushed the boundaries of current game genres and experiences, as well as discuss the future AI-based game design.},

abstract = {Inequality has long fascinated economists, and growing income inequality has been recently and heatedly discussed in public forums. A remarkable fact emerging from this discussion is the strong positive relationship between wage inequality and city size (Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2012). In this paper, we add to the study of inequality and distribution of economic activity in two ways. First, we document new facts on the interaction of geography with inequality. Second, we develop a quantifiable model which explains our findings and their implications. In particular, we study the effects of improving trade infrastructure on wage and welfare inequality. Our first contribution is to document facts about inequality and geography. We assign to each American city a measure of remoteness meant to capture its distance from all other cities. We then show that this measure correlates negatively with the skill premium, the ratio of the mean wage of college degree to the mean wage of non-college degree workers. That is, wage inequality is lower in remote cities. On the other hand, the less remote a city is, the higher its share of college degree workers. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to document these two facts. The literature has developed little in the way of a unified framework that incorporates both geography and inequality in the spatial economy. On one hand, economic geography examines the role of trade costs in determining spatial patterns of economic activity. This literature does not address inequality but welfare at the aggregate. A classic example is (Krugman, 1991), and a more recent one is Allen and Arkolakis (2014). On the other hand, recent models of spatial inequality often treat cities as isolated. Workers in a city interact with each other but cities in a nation either do not trade or trade costlessly (Davis and Dingel, 2014). Since the geographic location of a city relative to other cities remains irrelevant, this literature cannot address the interaction of geography with inequality. By including costly trade between cities in a model of mobile heterogeneous labor, we bridge the gap. In our model, we have a continuum of locations, workers, and firms. Workers come in two types, skilled and unskilled, and each worker has an ideosyncratic utility from living in each location. A worker decides where to live taking wages as given. A firm also takes local wages as given, and produces a tradable good using skilled and unskilled labor as inputs. The sole difference between the two types of labor is that skilled labor benefits more from agglomeration. We require a model which generates skill premia differing across locations. In particular, to match our empirical findings we want less remote cities to have higher skill premia. We develop a model with two critical features which delivers the required relationship. The two critical features are stronger agglomeration forces for skilled workers, and heterogenous location preferences. The intuition behind the model can be described in a few sentences. Consider a city near other cities, a centrally-located city. Its access to cheap tradable goods and nearby markets make it attractive to live in. This leads the city, all else equal, to have a relatively high population compared with a remote city. Due to agglomeration forces, skilled workers become relatively more productive in the centrally-located city. Thus, all else equal, firms there demand a relatively high share of skilled workers as inputs. In order for the relative share of skilled workers on the supply side to equal the firms demand for relative share of skilled workers as inputs, there must be a higher skill premium in the centrally-located city. Simulation results show that improving trade infrastructure benefits both types of labor, but low skill labor benefits more. Better infrastructure tends to spread populations out, so that skilled workers lose some of their agglomeration advantage over unskilled workers. Typically models of inequality and trade predict that skilled workers gain more than unskilled workers (Antr`as et al., 2006), a result that is reversed in our model. The literature on the skill premium has found a number of patterns. To the extent that we are able to measure the relevant variables, all of these facts are consistent with our data. The literature has shown convincingly that the skill premium is higher in cities with larger populations (Davis and Dingel, 2012). The relationship between the skill premium and city size has become stronger over time (Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2013; Lindley and Machin, 2014). In addition, larger cities have been shown to have a higher share of college-educated worker, another pattern which has strengthened over time (Moretti, 2008; Lindley and Machin, 2014). Areas of denser economic activity have higher skill premiums (Combes et al., 2012).These stylized facts have inspired a number of theories (Davis and Dingel, 2012, 2014; Baum-Snow and Pavan, 2012; Combes et al., 2012). These theories abstract from costly trade, treating trade between cities as either non-existant or frictionless.3 The style of our modeling exercise below has more in common with recent forays of trade economists into economic geography (Allen and Arkolakis, 2014; Desmet et al., 2014; Fajgelbaum et al., 2015). These theories model costly trade, and focus on the spatial location of economic activity. They have, however, only one type of labor, so they cannot analyze the interaction between geography and inequality. In an international trade context, Fujita and Thisse (2006) study inequality with costly trade, but their model has immobile unskilled workers. A recent working paper, Fan (2015) analyzes the impact of an international trade liberalization on inequality using a spatial equilibrium framework. As Fans focus is on aggregate welfare effects rather than on the forces determining the distribution of the skill premium, he relies on skilled and unskilled workers differentially valuing amenities to generate the observed distribution of the skill premium. Since we are interested in the geographic distribution of inequality, we have a much simpler model in which skilled workers only differ from the unskilled in terms of strength of agglomeration effects in the production function.},

abstract = {If you didn ' t grow it, you didn ' t explain it. — Josh Epstein (1999) In a minute there is time for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. — T. S. Eliot (from " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, " 1920) What I cannot create, I do not understand. — Richard Feynman (as seen on his blackboard and attributed by Hawking, 2001) In the previous two chapters, we had our first taste of working with agent-based modeling code, writing simple models, examining model code, and extending it. One can accomplish a lot by working with publicly available models and modifying and extending them. Even in the most advanced ABM models one can often find code snippets borrowed from other models. However, eventually you will want to design and build your own model from the ground up. This chapter is intended to take you from the first step of devising a question or area you want to explore, all the way through designing, and building your model, to refining your question and revising your model, to analyzing your results and answering your question. This sequence is presented here in linear order, but in reality these steps fold back on each other and are part of an iterative exploration and refinement of the model and motivating question. We will explore all of this within the context of a particular model, but at the same time we will discuss general issues related to model authoring and model design. To facilitate this process, this chapter is broken into three main sections: (1) Designing your model will take you through the process of determining what elements to include in your model, (2) Building your model will demonstrate how to take a conceptual model and create a com-putational object, and (3) Examining your model will address how to run your model, create some results, and analyze those results to provide a useful answer to your motivating question. 4 158 Chapter 4 Throughout this chapter we will be designing, building, and examining a simple model of an ecological system. The basic question that we will be addressing is: " How do the population levels of two habitat-sharing animal species change over time? " For our pur-poses in this chapter, we will call this model the Wolf Sheep Simple model. Though we will discuss this model in the context of two biological species, the model could be generalized to other situations such as companies competing for consumers, electoral parties competing for votes, or viruses evolving in a computer system. More important, the components that we will be developing in this model are basic components utilized in most ABMs.},

@book{Dawson2013,
abstract = {Cognitive science arose in the 1950s when it became apparent that a number of disciplines, including psychology, computer science, linguistics, and philosophy, were fragmenting. Perhaps owing to the field's immediate origins in cybernetics, as well as to the foundational assumption that cognition is information processing, cognitive science initially seemed more unified than psychology. However, as a result of differing interpretations of the foundational assumption and dramatically divergent views of the meaning of the term information processing, three separate schools emerged: classical cognitive science, connectionist cognitive science, and embodied cognitive science. Examples, cases, and research findings taken from the wide range of phenomena studied by cognitive scientists effectively explain and explore the relationship among the three perspectives. Intended to introduce both graduate and senior undergraduate students to the foundations of cognitive science, Mind, Body, World addresses a number of questions currently being asked by those practicing in the field: What are the core assumptions of the three different schools? What are the relationships between these different sets of core assumptions? Is there only one cognitive science, or are there many different cognitive sciences? Giving the schools equal treatment and displaying a broad and deep understanding of the field, Dawson highlights the fundamental tensions and lines of fragmentation that exist among the schools and provides a refreshing and unifying framework for students of cognitive science.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the behavior of virtual environments from the collaboration point-of-view, in which actors (human or virtual beings) interact and collaborate by means of interdependent tasks. In this sense, actors may realize tasks that are dependent on tasks performed by other actors, while the interdependencies between tasks (through resource management and temporal relations) delineate the overall behavior of a virtual environment. Our main goal is to propose an approach for the coordination of those behaviors. Initially a generic study of possible interdependencies between collaborative tasks is presented, followed by the formal modeling (using Petri Nets) of coordination mechanisms for those dependencies. In order to implement such mechanisms, an architecture of reusable and pluggable coordination components is also introduced. These components are used in an implementation of a multi-user videogame. The presented approach is a concrete step to create virtual societies of actors that collaborate to reach common goals without the risk of getting involved in conflicting or repetitive tasks. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The articles forming this volume reflect a variety of important trends, developments, and applications covering a range of current topics relating to the theory and applications of argumentation. Our aims in this introduction are, firstly, to place these contributions in the context of the historical foundations of argumentation in AI and, subsequently, to discuss a number of themes that have emerged in recent years resulting in a significant broadening of the areas in which argumentation based methods are used. We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship-in terms of both similarities and important differences-to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof. We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To do so, it suggests a framework for analyzing the two-way interplay between democratic values and democratic institutions. A group of citizens hold values that make them willing to rebel so as to preserve either strong executive constraints or open access to power. The share of these concerned citizens is evolving over time. Our model suggests a natural complementarity such that cultural dynamics reinforce institutional choices. We argue that the model can help to explain variation in democratic values and the history of political institutions across countries and over time, in terms of country-level heterogeneity. The model can also be used to consider the impact of foreign intervention on values and institutions.},

abstract = {A taxonomy of emotions of literary response is presented. Some emotions occur as readers confront a text: they depend on curiosity as new material is assimilated to schemata, or on dishabituation as schemata accommodate. Further modes of emotion arise if readers enter the world of a story: they arise as a writer represents eliciting patterns of emotion and the reader responds with sympathy as story characters face these patterns, from personal memories of emotion, and by identification with characters' goals and plans. Based on cognitive theory and literary criticism, a theory of identification in fictional literature is presented, derived from Aristotle's concept mimesis. The usual translations, 'imitation' or 'representation', are misleading: mimesis means something closer to 'simulation', as in computers. Fictional simulations run on people's minds. For them to run successfully readers (a) adopt a character's goals and use their own planning procedures to connect actions together meaningfully, (b) form mental models of imagined worlds, (c) receive speech acts addressed to them by the writer, and (d) integrate disparate elements to create a unified experience. In providing materials for these functions, great writers allow readers to respond creatively, to feel moved emotionally, to understand within themselves some of the relations between actions and emotions, and sometimes to undergo cognitive change. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Discourse connectives are words or phrases such as once, since, and on the contrary that explicitly signal the presence of a discourse relation. There are two types of ambiguity that need to be resolved during discourse processing. First, a word can be ambiguous between discourse or non-discourse usage. For example, once can be either a temporal discourse connective or a simply a word meaning "formerly". Secondly, some connectives are ambiguous in terms of the relation they mark. For example since can serve as either a temporal or causal connective. We demonstrate that syntactic features improve performance in both disambiguation tasks. We report state-of-the-art results for identifying discourse vs. non-discourse usage and human-level performance on sense disambiguation.},

@inproceedings{Wang2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cerebral mechanisms underlying the behaviours that lead to pathological overeating and obesity are poorly understood. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that modulates rewarding properties of food, is likely to be involved. To test the hypothesis that obese individuals have abnormalities in brain dopamine activity we measured the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in brain.

METHODS: Brain dopamine D2 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a radioligand for the dopamine D2 receptor). Bmax/Kd (ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum minus 1) was used as a measure of dopamine D2 receptor availability. Brain glucose metabolism was also assessed with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG).

FINDINGS: Striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the ten obese individuals (2.47 [SD 0.36]) than in controls (2.99 [0.41]; p {\textless} or = 0.0075). In the obese individuals body mass index (BMI) correlated negatively with the measures of D2 receptors (r=0.84; p {\textless} or = 0.002); the individuals with the lowest D2 values had the largest BMI. By contrast, neither whole brain nor striatal metabolism differed between obese individuals and controls, indicating that striatal reductions in D2 receptors were not due to a systematic reduction in radiotracer delivery.

INTERPRETATION: The availability of dopamine D2 receptor was decreased in obese individuals in proportion to their BMI. Dopamine modulates motivation and reward circuits and hence dopamine deficiency in obese individuals may perpetuate pathological eating as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. Strategies aimed at improving dopamine function may be beneficial in the treatment of obese individuals.},

It gives an introduction to unification and resolution in Prolog and presents the memory model and a basic execution model. These models are expanded to the Vienna Abstract Machine (VAM) with its two versions, the VAM2p and the VAM1p, and the most famous abstract machine, the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). The continuation passing style model of Prolog, binary Prolog, leads to the BinWAM. Abstract interpretation can be applied to gather information about a program. This information is used in the generation of very specialized machine code and in optimizations like clause indexing and instruction scheduling on each kind of abstract machine.},

In general, there has been a great deal of consistency across studies within the eye-movement literature, and researchers have discovered and examined many variables involved in the reading process that affect the nature of readers' eye movements. Despite remarkable progress, however, there are still a number of issues to be resolved. In this article, we discuss three controversial issues: (1) the extent to which eye-movement behavior is affected by low-level oculomotor factors versus higher-level cognitive processes; (2) how much information is extracted from the right of fixation; and (3) whether readers process information from more than one word at a time.},

abstract = {Research on insurgency has been invigorated during this past decade by better data, improved methods, and the urgency of understanding active engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. This “empiricists' insurgency” reinforces a classic literature on the essential role of civilians while challenging older theories about how they affect conflict outcomes. It provides a general framework describing “irregular” insurgencies (where government capacity exceeds rebel capacity), which is analytically cohesive and empirically tested using subnational data from multiple conflicts. The new research provides guidance on intervention design, including governance improvement, development programs, and rules of engagement. The design of interventions matters: Some key evidence comes from measuring the effects of misguided policies. The framework may enable better conceived and implemented interventions, including foreign engagements with and without troop deployment, depending on the type of insurgency and mindful of political limitations. We position these findings in the literature and highlight directions for future research, including legal aspects of countering insurgency.},

In this paper, we describe a next-generation personal information assistance engine that lets end-users delegate to it various simple context- and activity-reactive tasks and reminders. Our system, Atomate, treats RSS/ATOM feeds from social networking and life-tracking sites as sensor streams, integrating information from such feeds into a simple unified RDF world model representing people, places and things and their time-varying states and activities. Combined with other information sources on the web, including the user's online calendar, web-based e-mail client, news feeds and messaging services, Atomate can be made to automatically carry out a variety of simple tasks for the user, ranging from context-aware filtering and messaging, to sharing and social coordination actions. Atomate's open architecture and world model easily accommodate new information sources and actions via the addition of feeds and web services. To make routine use of the system easy for non-programmers, Atomate provides a constrained-input natural language interface (CNLI) for behavior specification, and a direct-manipulation interface for inspecting and updating its world model.},

abstract = {Argumentation is modelled as a game where the payoffs are measured in terms of the probability that the claimed conclusion is, or is not, defeasibly provable, given a history of arguments that have actually been exchanged, and given the probability of the factual premises. The probability of a conclusion is calculated using a standard variant of Defeasible Logic, in combination with standard probability calculus. It is a new element of the present approach that the exchange of arguments is analysed with game theoretical tools, yielding a prescriptive and to some extent even predictive account of the actual course of play. A brief comparison with existing argument-based dialogue approaches confirms that such a prescriptive account of the actual argumentation has been almost lacking in the approaches proposed so far.},

@article{Gallardo2002,
abstract = {The classic method for abstracting temporal properties when realizing abstract model checking is based on defining an abstract satisfiability relation which under-approximates the standard one. As a consequence, satisfiability of universal properties is directly preserved from the abstract model to the concrete one. However, this result may be impractical due to the imprecision and incompleteness with which abstract models are usually constructed. Thus, in the case a model checking tool supporting abstract model checking gives a negative answer, the user must analyze the counter-examples produced to decide whether the property really fails or, on the contrary, the abstract model is too imprecise to obtain a definitive result. We have developed an alternative method for abstracting temporal properties based on the idea of over-approximation. In this paper, we compare these two methods with respect to the satisfiability/refutation of universal/existential properties, proving that they produce complementary results. Finally, we study the conditions which ensure that the method based on over-approximation also produces definitive answers when analyzing universal properties. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The Supreme Court has continued to write constitutional history over the thirteen years since publication of the highly acclaimed first edition of The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court. Two new justices have joined the high court, more than 800 cases have been decided, and a good deal of new scholarship has appeared on many of the topics treated in the Companion. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presided over the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, and the Court as a whole played a decisive and controversial role in the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. Under Rehnquists's leadership, a bare majority of the justices have rewritten significant areas of the law dealing with federalism, sovereign immunity, and the commerce power.This new edition includes new entries on key cases and fully updated treatment of crucial areas of constitutional law, such as abortion, freedom of religion, school desegregation, freedom of speech, voting rights, military tribunals, and the rights of the accused. These developments make the second edition of this accessible and authoritative guide essential for judges, lawyers, academics, journalists, and anyone interested in the impact of the Court's decisions on American society.},

abstract = {The central theme of this paper is the implementation of Information Literacy provision for a Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) accredited M.A. programme. As the term “Information Literacy” covers a number of definitions and information practices the paper relates to several of the conference's key topics. For example, the predominant reliance on electronic provision addresses the issues of supporting e- learning and evaluating the effectiveness of Information and Communication Technologies. In addition, the efforts made to ensure that the MA addresses the information practitioners' Continuous Professional Development needs relates to the implementation of life-long learning by applying the heuristic strategy promoted by the IL approach. In line with the literature and the recommendations of information professional bodies such as Society of College National and University Libraries (SCONUL) and the American Library Association (ALA), Information Literacy is seen as the foundation of independent learning needed to support academic and professional development practices. IL integration at postgraduate level is illustrated through the delivery of the Applied Information Research module and the use of the knowledge-spiral approach to encourage students to engage fully with the processes of independent learning and reflective practices.},

At the same time, researchers have paid less attention to investigating the usability of common visualization techniques that many practitioners regularly use to visualize ontological data. In this paper, we focus on two popular ontology visualization techniques: indented tree and graph. We conduct a controlled usability study with an emphasis on the effectiveness, efficiency, workload and satisfaction of these visualization techniques in the context of assisting users during evaluation of ontology mappings. Findings from this study have revealed both strengths and weaknesses of each visualization technique. In particular, while the indented tree visualization is more organized and familiar to novice users, subjects found the graph visualization to be more controllable and intuitive without visual redundancy, particularly for ontologies with multiple inheritance.},

abstract = {This article reports the first systematic study on lucid nightmares—terrifying lucid dreams with a lack of dream control. An online survey was completed by 634 participants, of whom 574 had had previous lucid dream experience. According to the reports of lucid dreamers, less than half of them had experienced a lucid nightmare, and only 1{\%} of them could be considered as suffering from lucid nightmares—experiencing them once a week or more frequently. Lucid nightmares appear to be as distressing as ordinary nightmares. Lack of dream control and intense fear are among their most common features, followed by violent autonomous dream characters and the inability to wake up. Lucid nightmares are more likely to occur for women and nightmare sufferers, yet also for more frequent lucid dreamers and for those who experience lucid dreams spontaneously rather than them being induced deliberately. Key methodological points, for example, whether the awakening criterion in the definition of lucid nightmares should be included, are addressed, and suggestions for future research are provided.},

abstract = {We present an update to our Galaxy-based web server for processing and visualizing deeply sequenced data. Its core tool set, deepTools, allows users to perform complete bioinformatic workflows ranging from quality controls and normalizations of aligned reads to integrative analyses, including clustering and visualization approaches. Since we first described our deepTools Galaxy server in 2014, we have implemented new solutions for many requests from the community and our users. Here, we introduce significant enhancements and new tools to further improve data visualization and interpretation. deepTools continue to be open to all users and freely available as a web service atdeeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de The new deepTools2 suite can be easily deployed within any Galaxy framework via the toolshed repository, and we also provide source code for command line usage under Linux and Mac OS X. A public and documented API for access to deepTools functionality is also available.},

@article{Guizzardi2007,
abstract = {The software agent paradigm has received considerable attention recently, both in research and industrial practice. However, adoption of this software paradigm remains elusive in software engineering practice. We claim that part of the adoption problem lies with the fact that mentalistic and social concepts underlying agents are subjective and complex for the average practitioner. Specifically, although there are many efforts related to the topic coming from philosophy, cognitive sciences and computer science, a uniform and well-founded semantic view on these concepts is currently lacking. This work extends an existing upper-level ontology and offers it as a foundation for evaluating and designing agent-oriented modeling languages. In particular, the paper focuses on the concept of goal, aiming at disambiguating its definition, discussing its different manifestations, and clarifying its relation to other important agent-related concepts. For that, we examine how goals are conceived and used according to some relevant literature on agent-orientation. In addition, related work on akin fields, especially philosophy and AI are used as a basis for the proposed ontological extensions.},

@techreport{Budiu2011,
abstract = {It looks like a giant iPhone, is the first thing users say when asked to test an iPad. (Their second comment? Wow, its heavy.) But from an interaction design perspective, an iPad user interface shouldnt be a scaled-up iPhone UI. Indeed, one finding from our study is that the tab bar at the bottom of the screen works much worse on iPad than on iPhone. On the small phone, users are likely to notice the muted icons at the bottom of the screen, even if their attention is on content in the middle of the screen. But the iPads much bigger screen means that users are typically directing their gaze far from the tab bar and they ignore (and forget) those buttons. Another big difference between iPad and iPhone is that regular websites work reasonably well on the big tablet. In our iPhone usability studies, users strongly prefer using apps to going on the Web. Its simply too painful to use most websites on the small screen. (Mobile- optimized sites alleviate this issue, but even they usually have worse usability than apps.) The iPads bigger screen offers reasonable usability for regular Web pages. Of course, theres still the fat finger problem common to all touch screens, which makes it hard for users to reliably hit small targets. The iPad has a readtap asymmetry, where text big enough to be read is too small to touch. Thus, we definitely recommend large touch zones on any Web page hoping to attract many iPad users. Also, most Web pages offer a rich and overstuffed experience compared to the iPads sparse and regulated environment; when an iPad app suddenly launches users onto the Web, the transition can be jarring. For more than a decade, when we ask users for their first impression of (desktop) websites, the most frequently-used word has been busy. In contrast, the first impression of many iPad apps is beautiful. The change to a more soothing user experience is certainly welcome, especially for a device that may turn out to be more of a leisure computer than a business computer. Still, beauty shouldnt come at the cost of being able to actually use the apps to derive real benefits from their features and content.},

abstract = {In this paper a computational model of the cultural evolution process is described. This model integrates several traditional approaches to modeling cultural evolution into a common conceptual framework. This framework depicts cultural evolution as a process of dual inheritance. At the micro-evolutionary level there is a population of individuals, each described in terms of a set of behavioral traits. Traits are passed from generation to generation at this level by means of a number of socially motivated operators. At the macro-evolutionary level, individuals are able to generate "mappa" that generalize on their experience. These individual mappa can be merged to form group mappa and these group mappa can be generalized and specialized using a variety of generic and problem specific operators. A specific implementation of Cultural Algorithms is described using Genetic Algorithms to represent the population space and Version spaces (or lattices) to represent the set of possible schemata that can be produced via generalizations on the population space. Individual and group mappa are defined as subspaces within the lattice. It is shown how the addition of a belief space to the traditional Genetic Algorithm framework can affect the rate at which learning can take place in terms of the modifications that it produces in the traditional schema theorem for Genetic Algorithms.},

In this paper, we formalize and analyze the reasons behind the success of the BTs using standard tools of robot control theory, focusing on how properties such as robustness and safety are addressed in a modular way. In particular, we show how these key properties can be traced back to the ideas of subsumption and sequential compositions of robot behaviors. Thus BTs can be seen as a recent addition to a long research effort towards increasing modularity, robustness and safety of robot control software. To illustrate the use of BTs, we provide a set of solutions to example problems.},

Probably the most important single component of this framework is a parametric statistical model of word relatedness. A longstanding problem in IR has been to develop a mathematically principled model for document processing which acknowledges that one sequence of words may be closely related to another even if the pair have few (or no) words in common. The fact that a document contains the word automobile, for example, suggests that it may be relevant to the queries Where can I find information on motor vehicles? and Tell me about car transmissions, even though the word automobile itself appears nowhere in these queries. Also, a document containing the words plumbing, caulk, paint, gutters might best be summarized as common house repairs, even if none of the three words in this candidate summary ever appeared in the document.},

abstract = {This paper questions a key assumption in the organizations literature that the dynamism of institutional logics and practice variations is the result of rivalry among logics and actors, of tensions and institutional shifts, and of the agency of institutional entrepreneurs. This study examines in rich historical detail the development of accounting in the Jesuit Order, illustrating how Jesuit accounting started from a rationality that did not presuppose an external ordering principle; instead, Jesuit rationality was unfolding--founded in continuous interrogations informed by common, purposeful procedural logics stemming from rhetorical practices used to classify, recall, and invent knowledge. I examine this concept of unfolding rationality in two areas of Jesuit practices: spiritual self-accountability and administrative accounting and recordkeeping. In this Jesuit rationality, the relationships between means and ends, and how and why behaviors take place, were not anchored permanently in a substantive logic. Instead, procedural logics left individual Jesuits and the community to imagine modes of action in the specific social and organizational contexts in which their missions operated. Jesuit rationality was thus unfolding, a persistent and recursive mode of governing social behavior and searching for organizational order that generated large-scale administrative routines and institutional dynamism while never fully achieving that order. The analysis brings into question our understanding of the historical and institutional genealogies of modern rationality and its taken-for-granted link with Protestant ethics.},

The combination of the following capabilities makes Watson unique: (1) Natural language processing by helping to understand the complexities of unstructured data, which makes up as much as 80 percent of the data in the world today. (2) Hypothesis generation and evaluation by applying advanced analytics to weigh and evaluate a panel of responses based on only relevant evidence. (3) Dynamic learning by helping to improve learning based on outcomes to get smarter with each iteration and interaction Although none of these capabilities alone are unique to Watson, the combination delivers a powerful solution: (1) To move beyond the constraints of programmatic computing (2) To move from reliance on structured, local data to unlock the world of global, unstructured data (3) To move from decision tree-driven, deterministic applications to probabilistic systems that co-evolve with their users (4) To move from keyword-based search that provides a list of locations where an answer might (or might not) be located, to an intuitive, conversational means of discovering a set of confidence-ranked responses Cognitive systems, such as IBM Watson, can transform how organizations think, act, and operate in the future.

abstract = {The increasing integration of technology into our lives has created unprecedented volumes of data on society's everyday behaviour. Such data opens up exciting new opportunities to work towards a quantitative understanding of our complex social systems, within the realms of a new discipline known as Computational Social Science. Against a background of financial crises, riots and international epidemics, the urgent need for a greater comprehension of the complexity of our interconnected global society and an ability to apply such insights in policy decisions is clear. This manifesto outlines the objectives of this new scientific direction, considering the challenges involved in it, and the extensive impact on science, technology and society that the success of this endeavour is likely to bring about.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how to use design patterns in procedural level generation, with particular reference to the classic console game Super Mario Bros. In a previous paper, we analyzed the levels in this game to nd a set of recurring level design patterns, and discussed an implementation where levels were produced from concatenation of these patterns. In this paper, we instead propose using patterns as design objectives. An implementation of this based on evolutionary computation is presented. In this implementation, levels are represented as a set of vertical slices from the original game, and the tness function count the number of patterns found. Qualitative analysis of generated levels is performed in order to identify strengths and challenges of this method.},

Through close attention to the metaphors of AI and their consequences for the field's patterns of success and failure, it argues for a reorientation of the field away from thought in the head and toward activity in the world. By considering computational ideas in a philosophical framework, the author eases critical dialogue between technology and the humanities and social sciences. AI can benefit from new understandings of human nature, and in return, it offers a powerful mode of investigation into the practicalities and consequences of physical realization.},

abstract = {Kevin.Dill@lmco.com Eugene.Pursel@usmc.mil Pat.Garrity@us.army.mil Gino.Fragomeni@us.army.mil ABSTRACT There is an ongoing need for improved autonomous virtual characters for military training, particularly in areas such as squad-level scenarios for the Army and Marines. In the past, simulations have often used techniques such as scripting or Finite State Machines for Artificial Intelligence (AI) control of non-player characters. These approaches allow the scenario creator to have precise control over the actions of the characters, but the cost of configuration and the quality of the result scale poorly as the complexity of the AI grows. As a result, they tend to lead to AI behaviors that are rigid and predictable, and thus are insufficiently reactive to unexpected situations and not suitable for replay or repeated use. In previous papers we have endorsed utility-based AI as our preferred alternative. This approach enables the developer to think in terms of heuristic equations rather than simple black-and-white decisions, and thus to create an AI which can examine the subtle nuance of the situation and select actions accordingly. The resulting characters retain the strong authorial control of previous approaches, but they can be far more believable, adaptable, and reactive to the situation around themselves.},

@article{Grimm2013,
abstract = {Social systems are among the most complex known. This poses particular problems for those who wish to understand them. The complexity often makes analytic approaches infeasible and natural language approaches inadequate for relating intricate cause and effect. However, individual- and agent-based computational approaches hold out the possibility of new and deeper understanding of such systems.  Simulating Social Complexity examines all aspects of using agent- or individual-based simulation. This approach represents systems as individual elements having each their own set of differing states and internal processes. The interactions between elements in the simulation represent interactions in the target systems. What makes these elements "social" is that they are usefully interpretable as interacting elements of an observed society. In this, the focus is on human society, but can be extended to include social animals or artificial agents where such work enhances our understanding of human society.  The phenomena of interest then result (emerge) from the dynamics of the interaction of social actors in an essential way and are usually not easily simplifiable by, for example, considering only representative actors.  The introduction of accessible agent-based modelling allows the representation of social complexity in a more natural and direct manner than previous techniques. In particular, it is no longer necessary to distort a model with the introduction of overly strong assumptions simply in order to obtain analytic tractability. This makes agent-based modelling relatively accessible to a range of scientists. The outcomes of such models can be displayed and animated in ways that also make them more interpretable by experts and stakeholders.  This handbook is intended to help in the process of maturation of this new field. It brings together, through the collaborative effort of many leading researchers, summaries of the best thinking and practice in this area and constitutes a reference point for standards against which future methodological advances are judged. This book will help those entering into the field to avoid "reinventing the wheel" each time, but it will also help those already in the field by providing accessible overviews of current thought. The material is divided into four sections: Introductory, Methodology, Mechanisms, and Applications. Each chapter starts with a very brief section called ‘Why read this chapter?' followed by an abstract, which summarizes the content of the chapter. Each chapter also ends with a section of ‘Further Reading' briefly describing three to eight items that a newcomer might read next.},

abstract = {Although many investigators arm a desire to build reasoning systems that behave consistently with the axiomatic basis de ned by probability theory and utility theory, limited resources for engineering and computation can make a complete normative analysis impossible. We attempt to move discussion beyond the debate over the scope of problems that can be handled e ectively to cases where it is clear that there are in- sucient computational resources to perform an analysis deemed as complete. Under these conditions, we stress the importance of considering the expected costs and bene ts of applying alternative approximation procedures and heuristics for computation and knowledge acquisition. We discuss how knowledge about the structure of user utility can be used to control value tradeo s for tailoring inference to alternative contexts. We address the notion of real-time rationality, focusing on the application of knowledge about the expected timewise-re nement abilities of reasoning strategies to balance the bene ts of additional computation with the costs of acting with a partial result. We dis- cuss the bene ts of applying decision theory to control the solution of dicult problems given limitations and uncertainty in reasoning resources.},

abstract = {Wollastonite-based brushite cements are used for refractory material applications, but they may also offer prospects for the solidification/stabilization of hazardous waste. These binders are formed by the reaction of wollastonite with an orthophosphoric acid solution containing borax and metallic cations (Al3+, Zn2+). This work provides new insights into their setting and hardening process using a panel of characterization techniques (XRD, NMR, rheology{\ldots}). A multi-step hydration process is evidenced by the formation of several products: amorphous silica, monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (Ca(H2PO4)2{\textperiodcentered}H2O or MCPM), that precipitates transiently during the first stage of hydration, and brushite (CaHPO4{\textperiodcentered}2H2O) that crystallizes at higher pH (≥3). In addition, an amorphous phosphate phase containing aluminum, calcium and zinc massively precipitates at the beginning of hydration, and gets richer in calcium as hydration progresses. Setting of the cement paste occurs when brushite starts to form. The successive formation of MCPM and brushite is well predicted by thermodynamic modelling.},

The results show that individuals with relatively low time discounting are consistently positioned higher in the wealth distribution. The association between time discounting and the position in the wealth distribution is significant and of the same magnitude as the association between length of education and the position in the wealth distribution, and it exists after controlling for education, school grades, income, initial wealth, parental wealth, and credit constraints. Our results are consistent with the prediction of standard life-cycle savings theory that differences in time preferences generate differences in savings behavior and thereby wealth inequality},

abstract = {The paper provides an axiological analysis of the concepts of respect for information and of information dignity from the vantage point provided by Information Ethics and the conceptual paradigm of object-oriented analysis (OOA). The general perspective adopted is that of an ontocentric approach to the philosophy of information ethics, according to which the latter is an expansion of environmental ethics towards a less biologically biased concept of a 'centre of ethical worth'. The paper attempts to answer the following question: what is the lowest possible common set of attributes which characterises something as intrinsically valuable and an object of respect, and without which something would rightly be considered intrinsically worthless or even positively unworthy and therefore rightly disrespectable in itself? The thesis developed and defended in the paper is that the minimal condition of possibility of an object's least intrinsic worthiness can be identified with its abstract nature as an information entity. Thus, all entities, interpreted as clusters of information, have a minimal moral worth qua information objects (i.e. qua information), that deserves to be respected. The principles elaborated in the course of the analysis are those of 'reflective respect' (A's respect towards all members of A's class motivated by A's respect towards A not qua individual, but qua instantiation of a class of entities), 'ontic uniformity' (A's recognition of A's membership to the class of information entities) and 'ontic solidarity' (A's recognition of any information entity's dignity).},

The main goal of this work is to develop artificial creatures, controlled by cognitive architectures, with different levels of machine consciousness. To fulfil this goal, we propose the application of cognitive neuroscience concepts to incrementally develop a cognitive architecture following the evolutionary steps taken by the animal brain. The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments. A completely codelet-based system “Core” has been implemented, serving the whole architecture.},

The rules, norms, and shared strategies are constituted and reconstituted by human interaction in frequently occurring or repetitive situations. The syntax of the grammar identifies components of institutions and sorts them into three types of institutional statements: rules, norms, and shared strategies. We introduce the grammar, outline methods for operationalizing the syntax, apply the syntax to an analysis of cooperation in collective dilemma situations, and discuss the pragmatics of the grammar for analyses of behavior within complex institutional settings.},

abstract = {A suspension of microswimmers, the simplest realization of active matter, exhibits novel material properties: the emergence of collective motion, reduction in viscosity, increase in diffusivity, and extraction of useful energy. Bacterial dynamics in dilute suspensions suggest that hydrodynamic interactions and collisions between the swimmers lead to collective motion at higher concentrations. On the example of aerobic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, we report on spatial and temporal correlation functions measurements of collective state for various swimming speeds and concentrations. The experiments produced a puzzling result: while the energy injection rate is proportional to the swimming speed and concentration, the correlation length remains practically constant upon small speeds where random tumbling of bacteria dominates. It highlights two fundamental mechanisms: hydrodynamic interactions and collisions; for both of these mechanisms, the change of the swimming speed or concentration alters an overall time scale.},

abstract = {Researchers interested in the empirical specificities of algorithms in action (rather than broad, polemic statements about computation and culture) have a problem: How do we know about algorithms? In this paper I will argue that, in spite of the rational straightforwardness granted to them by critics and advocates, “algorithms” are tricky objects to know. This is not a particularly novel position: algorithms are commonly considered inscrutable as a result of 1) the proprietary nature of commercial systems, and 2) the technical know-how required to make sense of them. But what makes knowing algorithms really tricky, I propose, is that these two issues are only superficial problems: they suggest that the barriers to knowledge about algorithms are access and$\backslash$nexpertise. If only we had access and if only we had the expertise, then all would be clear and we could get on with our critical assessments. I want to suggest that in fixating on access and expertise, we reify a deficient understanding of how algorithms exist and work “in the wild,” outside of the theoretical definitions found in computer science textbooks. In the rest of this paper, I will outline what I see as the dominant critical approach to knowing algorithms, describe some problems that face this approach, and suggest an alternative definition of “algorithms” as they concern those of us on the outside.},

abstract = {Systems of autonomous and self-interested agents interacting to achieve individual and collective goals may exhibit undesirable or unexpected behaviour if left unconstrained. Norms have been widely proposed as a means of defining and enforcing societal constraints by using the deontic concepts of obligations, permissions and prohibitions to describe what must, may and should not be done, respectively. However, recent efforts to provide norm-enabled agent architectures that guide plan choices suffer from interfering with an agent's reasoning process, and thus limit the agent's autonomy more than is required by the norms alone. In this paper we describe an extension of the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions (BDI) architecture that enables normative reasoning used to help agents choose and customise plans taking norms into account. The paper makes three significant contributions: we provide a formal framework to represent norms compactly and to manage them; we present a formal characterisation of the normative positions induced by norms of an agent's execution within a given time period; and finally, we put forth a mechanism for plan selection and ranking taking into consideration a set of normative restrictions.},

Our approach couples player, designer, and algorithm to generate a novel game using preferences for game play style, general design aesthetics, and a novel story structure. Our approach is implemented in Game Forge, a system that uses search-based optimization to find and render a novel game world configuration that supports a sequence of plot points plus play style preferences. Additionally, Game Forge supports execution of the game through reactive control of game world logic and non-player character behavior.},

abstract = {The importance of overhearing, and other ways of monitoring communicative behaviour not explicitly directed at oneself, has been illustrated in numerous ethnographic studies of computer-supported cooperative work. This paper is concerned with a particular form of monitoring. A “peripheral participant” is defined as someone who has a legitimate interest in monitoring a joint task (being carried out by some “primary participants”) but who is not actively involved in carrying out the task themselves. The concept is illustrated through field studies of telemedical consultation and related to other analyses of overhearing. Two experiments are reported where participatory status was manipulated using a role-play task. Ratings of interpersonal awareness, measures of gaze direction and recall of the conversation all indicate that the task successfully operationalized the distinction between primary and peripheral participation. In addition, the experiment manipulated the visibility of the peripheral participant to a remote primary participant. This was shown to have an effect on the remote primary participant's interpersonal awareness of the peripheral participant. Potential mechanisms for this effect are considered. It is concluded that peripheral participation is a potentially important form of involvement that needs to be considered when designing and configuring equipment for video-mediated cooperative work.},

The second is a reference section, which includes a catalog of the 75 most important algorithmic problems. By browsing this catalog, readers can quickly identify what the problem they have encountered is called, what is known about it, and how they should proceed if they need to solve it. This book is ideal for the working professional who uses algorithms on a daily basis and has need for a handy reference. This work can also readily be used in an upper-division course or as a student reference guide.THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL comes with a CD-ROM that contains: a complete hypertext version of the full printed book. the source code and URLs for all cited implementations. over 30 hours of audio lectures on the design and analysis of algorithms are provided, all keyed to on-line lecture notes.},

@article{Soylu2017,
abstract = {Value creation in an organisation is a time-sensitive and data-intensive process, yet it is often delayed and bounded by the reliance on IT experts extracting data for domain experts. Hence, there is a need for providing people who are not professional developers with the flexibility to pose relatively complex and ad hoc queries in an easy and intuitive way. In this respect, visual methods for query formulation undertake the challenge of making querying independent of users' technical skills and the knowledge of the underlying textual query language and the structure of data. An ontology is more promising than the logical schema of the underlying data for guiding users in formulating queries, since it provides a richer vocabulary closer to the users' understanding. However, on the one hand, today the most of world's enterprise data reside in relational databases rather than triple stores, and on the other, visual query formulation has become more compelling due to ever-increasing data size and complexity—known as Big Data. This article presents and argues for ontology-based visual query formulation for end-users; discusses its feasibility in terms of ontology-based data access, which virtualises legacy relational databases as RDF, and the dimensions of Big Data; presents key conceptual aspects and dimensions, challenges, and requirements; and reviews, categorises, and discusses notable approaches and systems.},

It examines Searle's work in relation to current issues of central significance, including internalism versus externalism about mental and linguistic content, truth-conditional versus non-truth-conditional conceptions of content, the relative priorities of thought and language in the explanation of intentionality, the status of the distinction between force and sense in the theory of meaning, the issue of meaning scepticism in relation to rule-following, and the proper characterization of 'what is said' in relation to the semantics/pragmatics distinction. Written by a distinguished team of contemporary philosophers, and prefaced by an illuminating essay by Searle, the volume aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of Searle's work in philosophy of language, and to suggest innovative approaches to fundamental questions in that area.},

abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to set out the case for building robots with internal models as a possible route toward achieving a level of functional self-awareness that would usefully extend the capabilities of autonomous robots. The chapter argues that these capabilities will lead to enhanced safety – especially in physical human robot interaction (pHRI) – and, perhaps also, toward ethical behaviour in autonomous robots. Indeed, the chapter will advance the argument that safe and ethical autonomous robots may not be achievable at all without mechanisms for self-awareness. Importantly, the ideas and mechanisms proposed in this chapter are intended to be realisable with current and near-future technology, i.e. using conventional computing platforms embedded within existing or buildable robot bodies, with existing devices for sensing and actuation. Thus, this chapter is primarily about how we might engineer practical self-awareness, for safer (and possibly ethical) robots in the near-term. This chapter will be less concerned with philosophical questions such as whether, or not, such robots are really self-aware, although we will touch upon the question of what behaviour might, if exhibited, be argued as evidence for 'as if' self- awareness.},

abstract = {A robust autopilot design methodology using linear parameter varying transformations is presented and applied to a high-agile surface launched air defence missile, which is currently developed by Diehl-BGT-Defence. The lateral dynamics of the tail/thrust vector controlled missile are modelled as a second-order quasi-linear parameter varying (LPV) system. The incidence angle is used as exogenous variable, which is assumed to be estimated during missile flight. Decoupled lateral dynamics are assumed because of the application of a bank-to-turn manoeuvre plane angle control approach. Lateral single channel flight controllers are designed via H∞ -optimal control and $\mu$-synthesis with the LPV lateral dynamics, which are extended by uncertain models of control actuating system, time-delay and body bending model. The flight controllers for lateral dynamics are designed at a number of operating points described by the LPV model over the MACH flight envelope. The controllers are implemented using a gain scheduling approach, where an altitude dependent gain loss in the control loop is compensated with the inverse normalised air density. The flight controllers were implemented in the nonlinear simulation environment and tested in extreme flight manoeuvres. All flight controllers showed good damping and acceleration tracking performance and were stable during nonlinear simulations.},

abstract = {Conversational modeling is an important task in natural language understanding and machine intelligence. Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.},

abstract = {Brittleness is a common problem among AI systems. Autonomous systems, including those that learn, may be faced with unan-ticipated situations that cause decreased performance, or in the worst-case, catastrophic failures from which the system cannot recover. In this paper, we describe a construct called the metacognitive loop (MCL) that allows AI systems to monitor their own behavior, generate expectations about their own progress and performance, and verify that they are met. When expectations are violated, the metacognitive loop attempts to reason in a domain-general way about why expectations were not met and how to recover. The basis for reasoning is a set of ontologies that encode abstract diagnosic and prescriptive processes for coping with failures.},

abstract = {The present paper begins with the well-traveled notion of institutions as " the rules of the game " and seeks to give some conceptual concreteness to the idea of rules in order to understand what it means to break the rules. While rules certainly channel and constrain behavior, and in principle require some actions and prohibit others, deviations from these requirements and prohibitions do occur. In addition, rules may be " interpreted, " and the rules, themselves, do change – what humans devise they may revise. With all this conceptual movement, are the rules of the game too wobbly a foundation for the study of institutions? Note to Ostrom Workshop Colloquium Series readers: This is, indeed, a " work in progress, " inasmuch as potential blind alleys and false starts, as well as only the earliest version of a potential way forward, are in evidence in the present draft. The topic, moreover, is somewhat more abstract and foundational than is your normal fare. While I would welcome technical reactions and constructive advice, I am especially interested in the practical matter about how to wrap one's mind around " the rules of the game. "},

abstract = {This paper pays tribute to Tajfel's classic article 'Cognitive aspects of prejudice' and re-examines its central arguments. Tajfel's paper is important for outlining a social cognitive approach to the study of prejudice and also for refuting of what Tajfel called the 'blood-and-guts' approach. Taking Tajfel's proposition that social psychology is not value-free, the current paper examines the moral and political view of 'Cognitive aspects' and also the gaps in its approach to the study of prejudice. It is suggested that this cognitive approach has difficulty in accounting for extreme bigotry, at least without recourse to the motivational themes that the approach seeks to exclude. In particular, there would be limitations in applying this approach in order to understand the Holocaust. Indeed, Tajfel did not attempt to do so, for reasons that are discussed. Tajfel's Social Identity Theory (SIT) has similar limitations. The paper also examines Tajfel's use of the term 'depersonalization', which he described as a 'milder' form of dehumanization of out-groups. Later social identity theorists have tended to use 'depersonalization' differently, shifting their attention to in-groups. Their perspective moves away from understanding the topic of prejudice in the way that can be found in Tajfel's 'Cognitive aspects of prejudice'. Finally, the present paper suggests how extreme prejudice might be studied without returning to the motivational 'blood-and-guts' approach that Tajfel so cogently criticized.},

abstract = {Intuitively speaking, " self-programming " means the ability for a computer system to program its own actions. This notion is clearly related to Artificial Intelligence, and has been used by many researchers. Like many other high-level concepts, however, scrutiny shows that the term can be interpreted in several different ways. To make the discussion concrete and meaningful we introduce here a working definition of self-programming. In this definition we increase its concreteness while trying to keep the intuitive meaning of the concept. The activities of a computer system usually are considered to consist of atomic actions (which can also be called instructions, operations, behavior, or something else in different contexts). At any given moment the system's primitive actions are in a finite and constant set A, meaning that they are distinct from each other, and can be enumerated. An action may take some input arguments, and produce some output arguments. The system can execute each of its actions, This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.},

Using state corporate tax rate changes as a setting, we show that cutting state corporate tax rates leads to increases in income inequality. This result is robust to using regression and matching approaches, and to controlling for a host of potential confounders. Contrary to the effects of tax cuts, we find no effects of tax increases on income inequality at the state level. We then use data from the IRS Statistics of Income to explore the mechanism behind the rise in income inequality. We fi nd tax cuts lead to higher reported capital income and a decrease in wage and salary income. These effects are concentrated among top earners, and we fi nd no effects for those reporting less than {\$}200,000 in income. This result provides evidence that one mechanism for the relation between tax cuts and inequality is that wealthy individuals shift their income to reduce taxes while others do not. Finally, we explore the effects of corporate tax cuts on capital investment using data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures. We  find that tax cuts lead to an increase in real investment, suggesting a trade-off between investment and inequality at the state level.},

In places like World of Warcraft, Second Life, and Free Realms, people are making friends, building communities, creating art, and making real money. Business is booming on the virtual frontier, as billions of dollars are paid in exchange for pixels on screens. But sometimes things go wrong. Virtual criminals defraud online communities in pursuit of real-world profits. People feel cheated when their avatars lose virtual property to wrongdoers. Increasingly, they turn to legal systems for solutions. But when your avatar has been robbed, what law is there to assist you? In Virtual Justice, Greg Lastowka illustrates the real legal dilemmas posed by virtual worlds. Presenting the most recent lawsuits and controversies, he explains how governments are responding to the chaos on the cyberspace frontier. After an engaging overview of the history and business models of today's virtual worlds, he explores how laws of property, jurisdiction, crime, and copyright are being adapted to pave the path of virtual law. Virtual worlds are becoming more important to society with each passing year. This pioneering study will be an invaluable guide to scholars of online communities for years to come. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Greg Lastowka. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The analysis of large graphs plays a prominent role in various fields of research and is relevant in many important application areas. Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand, and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques cover techniques that had been introduced until 2000 or concentrate only on graph layouts published until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as time-varying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graph-structured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this State-of-the-Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review firstly considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process. We also present main open research challenges in this field.},

@article{Song2014,
abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly configurable. While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks, such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory, unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore, every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system's effective configuration space-the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal-could comprise only a tiny subset of the system's full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system's effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system's behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The key improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions-a construct that improves iTree's ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree's running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the similar to 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.},

abstract = {Emergence in games is a topic that has garnered much debate in recent years. Developers and players speculate that it would be fantastic if we could achieve gameplay that is open and natural, where players can choose their own strategies and the gameplay is limited only by the player's imagination and creativity. In recent years, games have taken steps toward this fantasy with emergent interactions made possible by Valve's Source engine and the availability of advanced physics middleware, as well as emergent gameplay achieved in games such as The Sims and SimCity. However, developers quickly realize the trade-off between emergence and design. Giving the players control has meant letting go of their own. Despite all the recent attention, the concept of emergence is still quite ambiguous and undefined in games. Many people think it would be great to have emergent gameplay, but what does this mean and how do game developers achieve it? Throughout this book, I define emergence and examine the concept from various perspectives. I also provide many ideas and examples of how to incorporate emergence into current games. This book aims to serve as food for thought and a starting place for growing a wealth of knowledge, understanding, research, and applications for emergence in games. The future of game development lies in more open, interactive, and emergent gameplay. The future starts now.},

abstract = {Despite the rise of computer games as a leisure phenomenon, there has been relatively little research into this area. Furthermore, almost all of the research to date has concentrated on arcade or console games. More recently, the Internet has become a new medium in which players can play videogames. Since there is no published research in this area, some "benchmark" data on which future research can build was collected from two online gaming fan sites. Sociodemographics showed that the majority of players were male (approximately 85{\%}). Over 60{\%} of players were older than 19 years. The data provide clear evidence that the game clientele is very much an adult profile and suggest a different picture to the stereotypical image of an adolescent online gamer. The stereotype of the typical online player being a socially withdrawn young male with limited sex role identity appears to be misplaced.},

In this study we examined the extent to which pluralistic ignorance affects hooking up. One hundred thirty-six female and 128 male college students answered questions regarding their own comfort and their perceived peers'comfort in engaging in a variety of sexual behaviors while hooking up. We hypothesized and found that both women and men rated their peers as being more comfortable engaging in these behaviors than they rated themselves. Men expressed more comfort than did women in engaging in these behaviors, and both sexes overestimated the other gender's comfort with hooking up behaviors. Pluralistic ignorance appears to apply to hooking up on college campuses, and we explore some potential consequences of pluralistic ignorance in this context.},

How can we learn about aesthetics, ethics and divine attributes from Zork, Grand Theft Auto, and Civilization? A variety of increasingly sophisticated video games are rapidly overtaking books, films, and television as America's most popular form of media entertainment. It is estimated that by 2011 over 30 percent of US households will own a Wii console - about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953. In Philosophy Through Video Games, Jon Cogburn and Mark Silcox - philosophers with game industry experience - investigate the aesthetic appeal of video games, their effect on our morals, the insights they give us into our understanding of perceptual knowledge, personal identity, artificial intelligence, and the very meaning of life itself, arguing that video games are popular precisely because they engage with longstanding philosophical problems. Topics covered include: The Problem of the External World Dualism and Personal Identity Artificial and Human Intelligence in the Philosophy of Mind The Idea of Interactive Art The Moral Effects of Video Games Games and God's Goodness Games discussed include: Madden Football, Wii Sports, Guitar Hero, World of Warcraft, Sims Online, Second Life, Baldur's Gate, Knights of the Old Republic, Elder Scrolls, Zork, EverQuest Doom, Halo 2, Grand Theft Auto, Civilization, Mortal Kombat, Rome: Total War, Black and White, Aidyn Chronicles Paperback: 202 pages Publisher: Routledge; 1 edition (December 23, 2008) Language: English},

abstract = {We present a formal model of argumentation based on situation calculus which captures both the logical and the procedural aspects of argumentation processes. The logic is used to determine what is accepted by each agent participating in the discussion and by the group as a whole, on the basis of the speech acts performed during argumentation. Argumentation protocols, also called rules of order, describe declaratively which speech acts are legal in a particular state of the argumentation. We first discuss argumentation with fixed rules of order. Our model tolerates protocol violations but makes it possible to object to illegal actions. In realistic settings the rules of order themselves can at any time become the topic of the debate. We show how meta‐level argumentation of this kind can be modelled in what we call dynamic argument systems. To illustrate the notions introduced in the paper we present a reconstruction of Rescher's theory of formal disputation and a dynamic argument system with three levels which we use to discuss a murder case.},

In this paper, we analyze how the BT representation increases the modularity of an HDS and how key system properties are preserved over compositions of such systems, in terms of combining two BTs into a larger one. We also show how BTs can be seen as a generalization of sequential behavior compositions, the subsumption architecture, and decisions trees. These three tools are powerful but quite different, and the fact that they are unified in a natural way in BTs might be a reason for their popularity in the gaming community. We conclude the paper by giving a set of examples illustrating how the proposed analysis tools can be applied to robot control BTs.},

By extending recent work on tensed action logic, it becomes possible to pin down a specific interpretation of responsibility with a well specified semantics and a convenient and intuitive logic for expression. Once descriptions of direct agent responsibility can be formed, there is a foundation upon which to characterise the dynamics of how responsibility can be acquired, transferred and discharged and, in particular, how delegation can be effected. The resulting logic, designed specifically to cater for responsibility and delegation, can then be employed to offer an axiological and semantic exploration of the related concepts of forbearance, imperatives and group communication. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {By suspending belief that an objective world exists to be reported, we develop a conception of news as a constructed reality. Public events are held to exist because of the practical purposes they serve, rather than because of their inherent objective importance. The news content of mass media is seen as the result of practical, purposive, and creative activities on the part of news promoters, news assemblers and news consumers. At each stage in the process of generating an event, a given happening is attended to and its features assembled in the context of what has gone before and anticipated in the future. The result is a process of news creation, a kind of accounting procedure, accomplished according to the occasioned event needs of those with access to media. The manner in which access is accomplished can vary and these variations lead to a typology of event types: routines, accidents, scandals and serendipitous events. Each type of event tends to reveal different kinds of information about the ways society is organized, and each type holds different challenges to those who have or lack power. The general implications of this schema for the study of media and power are discussed.},

abstract = {• The handling of Clinton's interview on July 2, 2016. With regard to these investigative decisions, we found, as detailed in Chapter Five, that the Midyear team: • Sought to obtain evidence whenever possible through consent but also used compulsory process, including grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, and 2703(d) orders (court orders for non-content email information) to obtain various evidence. We found that the prosecutors provided justifications for the preference for consent that were supported by Department and FBI policy and practice; • Conducted voluntary witness interviews to obtain testimony, including from Clinton and her senior aides, and did not require any witnesses to testify before the grand jury. We found that one of the reasons for not using the grand jury for testimony involved concerns about exposing grand jurors to classified information; • Did not seek to obtain every device, including those of Clinton's senior aides, or the contents of every email account through which a classified email may have traversed. We found that the reasons for not doing so were based on limitations the Midyear team imposed on the investigation's scope, the desire to complete the investigation well before the election, and the belief that the foregone evidence was likely of limited value. We further found that those reasons were, in part, in tension with Comey's response in October 2016 to the discovery of Clinton emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the husband of Clinton's former Deputy Chief of Staff and personal assistant, Huma Abedin; • Considered but did not seek permission from the Department to review certain highly classified materials that may have included information potentially relevant to the Midyear investigation.

abstract = {If artificial intelligence (AI) were achievable, what would the conse-quences be for human society? 1 Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is already at hand. We are achieving rapid and accelerating success in our quest to build AI. That very success — and the slowness with which both the academic community and the general public have come to recognise it — has shown how lit-tle we understand our own intelligence, and its role in our lives and culture. Here I attempt to address this problem of understanding, exploiting a variety of scientific evidence, including social simulation. I begin by reviewing current progress in AI, which is profound but underestimated. I suggest this lack of recognition is due to the mistaken belief that intelligence implies agency. I next examine the related question of human uniqueness: why do only we have language and extensive built culture? I use models and data to show that the propensities to use culture, share information and behave altruistically are neither unique to humans nor inexplicable to biology, but rather our uniqueness hinges on the extent of our capacities for communication and memory. Finally, I apply the impact of AI on extending our intelligence to these theories, to predict—and observe—consequences of AI on human societies and in-dividual human lives. I make and support policy recommendations based on these predictions.},

Here we describe tools for data analysis and visualization that take as input integration site data from our INSPIIRED pipeline. Paired-end sequencing allows inference of the numbers of transduced cells as well as the distributions of integration sites in target genomes. We present interactive heat maps that allow comparison of distributions of integration sites to genomic features and which support numerous user-defined statistical tests. To summarize integration site data from human gene therapy samples, we developed a reproducible report format that catalogs sample population structure, longitudinal dynamics, and integration frequency near cancer-associated genes. We also introduce a novel summary statistic, the UC50 (Unique Cell progenitors contributing the most expanded 50{\%} of progeny cell clones), which provides a single number summarizing possible clonal expansion. Using these tools, we characterize ongoing longitudinal characterization of a patient from the first trial to treat SCID-X1, showing successful reconstitution for 15 years accompanied by persistence of a cell clone with an integration site near the cancer-associated gene CCND2.

The normative state of a contract, at a particular time, is the aggregation of instances of normative relations that hold between contract parties at that time, plus the current values of contract variables. The effects of contract events on the normative state of a contract are specified using an XML formalisation of the Event Calculus, called ecXML. We use an example mail service agreement from the domain of web services to ground the discussion of our work. We give a characterisation of the agreement according to the normative concepts of: obligation, power and permission, and show how the ecXML representation may be used to track the state of the agreement, according to a narrative of contract events. We also give a description of a state tracking architecture, and a contract deployment tool, both of which have been implemented in the course of our work.},

@article{Brenner2009,
abstract = {In order to behave intelligently, artificial agents must be able to deliberatively plan their future actions. Unfortunately, realistic agent environments are usually highly dynamic and only partially observable, which makes planning computationally hard. For most practical purposes this rules out planning techniques that account for all possible con- tingencies in the planning process. However, many agent environments permit an alternative approach, namely continual planning, i.e. the interleaving of planning with acting and sens- ing. This paper presents a new principled approach to continual planning that describes why andwhen an agent should switch between planning and acting. The resulting continual plan- ning algorithm enables agents to deliberately postpone parts of their planning process and instead actively gather missing information that is relevant for the later refinement of the plan. To this end, the algorithm explictly reasons about the knowledge (or lack thereof) of an agent and its sensory capabilities. These concepts are modelled in the planning language (MAPL). Since in many environments the major reason for dynamism is the behaviour of other agents, MAPL can also model multiagent environments, common knowledge among agents, and communicative actions between them. For Continual Planning, MAPL intro- duces the concept of of assertions, abstract actions that substitute yet unformed subplans. To evaluate our continual planning approach empirically we have developed MAPSIM, a sim- ulation environment that automatically builds multiagent simulations from formal MAPL domains. Thus, agents can not only plan, but also execute their plans, perceive their envi- ronment, and interact with each other. Our experiments show that, using continual planning techniques, deliberate action planning can be used efficiently even in complex multiagent environments.},

abstract = {The ability of autistic children to learn by applying logical rules has been used widely in behavioral therapies for social training. We propose to teach social skills to autistic children through games that simultaneously stimulate social behavior and include recognition of elements of social interaction. For this purpose we created a multi-agent platform of interactive blocks, and we created appropriate games that require shared activities leading to a common goal. The games included perceiving and understanding elements of social behavior that non-autistic children can recognize. We argue that the importance of elements of social interaction such as perceiving interaction behaviors and assigning metaphoric meanings has been overlooked, and that they are very important in the social training of autistic children. Two games were compared by testing them with users. The first game focused only on the interaction between the agents and the other combined interaction between the agents and metaphoric meanings that are assigned to them. The results show that most of the children recognized the patterns of interaction as well as the metaphors when they were demonstrated through embodied agents and were included within games having features that engage the interest of this user group. The results also show the potential of the platform and the games to influence the social behavior of the children positively.},

abstract = {Although redundancy in model specification generally has negative connotations, we offer arguments for revising those convictions. Defining {\&}ldquo;representational redundancy{\&}rdquo; as the inclusion of any symbols not required to fulfill the study objectives, we cite several sources of redundancy, classified as accidental or intentional, that contribute positively to the model development tasks. Comparative benefits and detriments are discussed briefly. Focusing on the most interesting source of redundancy{\&}dash;that which is intentionally induced by a modeling methodology{\&}mdash;we demonstrate that automated elimination of redundancy can actually improve model execution time. Using four models drawn from the literature that are easily understood, but which represent some differences in size and complexity, the direct graphical representations shows improvements over a  base case ranging from 27.3 percent to 68.1 percent in execution time. Further, increasing improvement is realized with increasing model size and complexity.

abstract = {Abstract This paper provides a computational framework, based on defeasible logic, to capture some aspects of institutional agency. Our background is Kanger-Lindahl-P{\"{o}}rn account of organised interaction, which describes this interaction within a multi-modal logical setting. This work focuses in particular on the notions of counts-as link and on those of attempt and of personal and direct action to realise states of affairs. We show how standard defeasible logic (DL) can be extended to represent these concepts: the resulting system preserves some basic properties commonly attributed to them. In addition, the framework enjoys nice computational properties, as it turns out that the extension of any theory can be computed in time linear to the size of the theory itself.},

This book is designed to help the reader navigate the complex and ever-changing nature of the discipline and gain an overview of the key concepts, methods and theories. The authors adopt a broad approach to trace the roots and legacies of social psychology with a keen eye to the future. Each chapter provides an in-depth look at a social psychological topic of significance, ranging from self and conflict to families and embodiment. Four theoretical perspectives - cognitive social, discursive psychological, phenomenological and social psychoanalytic - enable students to critically analyse social psychological research. These perspectives are interpreted through the interrogative themes of: Individual-society dualism Agency-structure dualism Situated knowledges Power relations},

The main goal of this work is to develop artificial creatures, controlled by cognitive architectures, with different levels of machine consciousness. To fulfil this goal, we propose the application of cognitive neuroscience concepts to incrementally develop a cognitive architecture following the evolutionary steps taken by the animal brain. The triune brain theory proposed by MacLean and also Arrabale‟s ConsScale will serve as roadmaps to achieve each developmental stage, while iCub - a humanoid robot and its simulator - will serve as a platform for the experiments. A completely codelet-based system “Core” has been implemented, serving the whole architecture.},

Using the case of Four Winds Festival Bermagui, New South Wales, the paper discusses our use of “sound diaries” as a means to better understand the role of sound in participants' understanding of place. Highlighted within our discussion is how our experimental methodology overcomes some of the inherent problems of researching so-called “sound geographies.” Sound diaries provide a possible technique to provide partial insights into the embodied knowledge triggered by sounds and music. Woven within these personal interpretations and their attributed meanings are more general themes concerning the concept of soundscapes, practices of listening, the role of sound in the mutual constitution of place and identities, and the embodied underpinnings of place-making practices in relation to sound and music.},

He offers an extensive review and critique of institutional analysis in sociology, political science, and economics as it relates to recent theory and research on organizations. The second edition gives particular attention to the topics of agency and structure and to institutional change. Given the constraining and constitutive properties of institutions, how can actors intervene to introduce novelty? How is change possible? To a previous concern with "convergent" change, a focus on increasing structural isomorphism, the author adds a thorough analysis of the sources of "disruptive" change, deinstitutionalization, and the emergence of new kinds of institutions.},

@book{Edmonds2013,
abstract = {Social systems are among the most complex known. This poses particular problems for those who wish to understand them. The complexity often makes analytic approaches infeasible and natural language approaches inadequate for relating intricate cause and effect. However, individual- and agent-based computational approaches hold out the possibility of new and deeper understanding of such systems. Simulating Social Complexity examines all aspects of using agent- or individual-based simulation. This approach represents systems as individual elements having each their own set of differing states and internal processes. The interactions between elements in the simulation represent interactions in the target systems. What makes these elements "social" is that they are usefully interpretable as interacting elements of an observed society. In this, the focus is on human society, but can be extended to include social animals or artificial agents where such work enhances our understanding of human society. The phenomena of interest then result (emerge) from the dynamics of the interaction of social actors in an essential way and are usually not easily simplifiable by, for example, considering only representative actors. The introduction of accessible agent-based modelling allows the representation of social complexity in a more natural and direct manner than previous techniques. In particular, it is no longer necessary to distort a model with the introduction of overly strong assumptions simply in order to obtain analytic tractability. This makes agent-based modelling relatively accessible to a range of scientists. The outcomes of such models can be displayed and animated in ways that also make them more interpretable by experts and stakeholders. This handbook is intended to help in the process of maturation of this new field. It brings together, through the collaborative effort of many leading researchers, summaries of the best thinking and practice in this area and constitutes a reference point for standards against which future methodological advances are judged. This book will help those entering into the field to avoid "reinventing the wheel" each time, but it will also help those already in the field by providing accessible overviews of current thought. The material is divided into four sections: Introductory, Methodology, Mechanisms, and Applications. Each chapter starts with a very brief section called ‘Why read this chapter?' followed by an abstract, which summarizes the content of the chapter. Each chapter also ends with a section of ‘Further Reading' briefly describing three to eight items that a newcomer might read next.},

abstract = {Resistance training produces an array of health benefits, as well as the potential to promote muscular adaptations of strength, size, power and endurance. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) regularly publish a position stand making recommendations for optimal achievement of the desired training goals. However, the most recent position stand (as well as previous ones) has come under heavy criticism for misrepresentation of research, lack of evidence and author bias. Therefore this paper proposes a set of scientifically rigorous resistance training guidelines, reviewing and summarising the relevant research for the purpose of proposing more logical, evidence-based training advice. We recommend that appreciably the same muscular strength and endurance adaptations can be attained by performing a single set of {\~{}}8-12 repetitions to momentary muscular failure, at a repetition duration that maintains muscular tension throughout the entire range of motion, for most major muscle groups once or twice each week. All resistance types (e.g. free-weights, resistance machines, bodyweight, etc.) show potential for increases in strength, with no significant difference between them, although resistance machines appear to pose a lower risk of injury. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that balance from free weights or use of unstable surfaces shows any transference to sporting improvement, and explosive movements are also not recommended as they present a high injury risk and no greater benefit than slow, controlled weight training. Finally, we consider genetic factors in relation to body type and growth potential.},

abstract = {Recommending products to consumers means not only understanding their tastes, but also understanding their level of experience. For example, it would be a mistake to recommend the iconic film Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys other action movies; rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy it -- once they are ready. The same is true for beers, wines, gourmet foods -- or any products where users have acquired tastes: the `best' products may not be the most `accessible'. Thus our goal in this paper is to recommend products that a user will enjoy now, while acknowledging that their tastes may have changed over time, and may change again in the future. We model how tastes change due to the very act of consuming more products -- in other words, as users become more experienced. We develop a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience. We find that such a model not only leads to better recommendations, but also allows us to study the role of user experience and expertise on a novel dataset of fifteen million beer, wine, food, and movie reviews.},

abstract = {This article addresses contemporary concerns about critique through an interpretation of the “writing prophets.” This approach draws on Foucauldian genealogy and suggests that alongside Greek parrhesia, Old Testament prophecy is a key forerunner of contemporary critical discourses. Our analysis draws upon Weber's interpretative historical sociology and Gadamerian hermeneutics but shifts the emphasis from charisma to critique, through a direct engagement with prophetic texts. In particular, prophetic discourse claims to reveal injustice and idolatry and speaks from a position of transcendence within immanent historical moments. Prophets position their own era as a moment of crisis, and themselves as liminal figures, opposed to the delusion of others and “false prophets” which resonates with contemporary conceptions of “ideology.” Rather than focusing on historical individuals, we approach prophecy as a discourse, multiple and hybrid, discontinuous, and contradictory, yet constituting a distinctive precursor which informs contemporary critique. {\textcopyright} 2017, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017.},

Even though play predates culture and games have long been pervasive in our civilization, the advent of videogames has pushed even further the role of games as communicational and cultural products. This situation demands a set of rhetori- cal tools that take into account the particularities of games and how they are played. The main objective of this dissertation is to provide a foundation upon which building play rhetoric, one that is complete enough to take into account the core elements that contrib- ute to the playerʼs construction of meaning while engaged in play. In order to achieve this, it is first needed to question our current ontologies of play and game and propose an alter- native one that shifts the current systemic bias towards an approach that also takes into account player performance. Since ultimately the goal of this dissertation is to contribute to the nascent field of play rhetoric, it complements its theoretical tools with multiple examples of rhetorical analysis of games, videogames, toys and play activities.},

We argue that social identity is an important factor; therefore, agents should incorporate social identity theory in their behaviour, which implies the ability to cat- egorize others (and themselves) into social groups. In ad- dition, social situations often present social dilemmas with expected rational choices. Social identity may in uence the agent to deviate from the rational choice. However, in some situations the rational choice may be the expected, and be- lievable, behaviour. In fact, we argue that nding the dy- namics between the social bias induced by social identity and the rational motivation is one of the challenges of building believable agents. In all this, anticipation takes an impor- tant role, as it is important to understand the others to cope well with a social situation.},

Most current techniques, however, are limited in one of three ways: either they overly restrict user actions, have a high cost for creating varied content, or rely on a rep- resentation that prohibits conveying complex content to the user. Toward addressing these issues, we introduce Socially Consistent Role Passing, a mechanism for ensuring consistent character behaviour that leverages the design of PaSSAGE, an existing system for generating adaptive, interactive stories. While results from previous human user studies have shown that PaSSAGE improves the enjoyment of players with lit- tle gaming experience, we present results from a new study showing that PaSSAGE's adaptive stories, augmented with Socially Consistent Role Passing, improve the enjoyment of all players versus a set of fixed-structure alternatives.},

abstract = {Traditional saliency models usually adopt hand-crafted image features and human-designed mechanisms to calculate local or global contrast. In this paper, we propose a novel computational saliency model, i.e., deep spatial contextual long-term recurrent convolutional network (DSCLRCN) to predict where people looks in natural scenes. DSCLRCN first automatically learns saliency related local features on each image location in parallel. Then, in contrast with most other deep network based saliency models which infer saliency in local contexts, DSCLRCN can mimic the cortical lateral inhibition mechanisms in human visual system to incorporate global contexts to assess the saliency of each image location by leveraging the deep spatial long short-term memory (DSLSTM) model. Moreover, we also integrate scene context modulation in DSLSTM for saliency inference, leading to a novel deep spatial contextual LSTM (DSCLSTM) model. The whole network can be trained end-to-end and works efficiently when testing. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that DSCLRCN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed DSCLSTM model can significantly boost the saliency detection performance by incorporating both global spatial interconnections and scene context modulation, which may uncover novel inspirations for studies on them in computational saliency models.},

The framework accounts for people's need to view these changes from different perspectives: an artifact-based view, a person-based view and a workspace-based view. Each information element is further broken down into distinguishing features and matched against these perspectives, e.g., location history within the where category prompts the questions 'where was this artifact when I left' in the artifact-based view, 'where in the workspace has a person visited' in the person-based view and 'where have people been in the workspace' in the workspace-based view. The framework can be used both to inform and critique change awareness tools. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The enormous popularity of the Nintendo Wii, Guitar Hero, and smaller games like Bejeweled or Zuma has turned the stereotype of the obsessed young male gamer on its head. Players of these casual games are not required to possess an intimate knowledge of video game history or to devote weeks or months to play. At the same time, many players of casual games show a dedication and skill that is anything but casual. In A Casual Revolution, Jesper Juul describes this as a reinvention of video games, and of our image of video game players, and explores what this tells us about the players, the games, and their interaction.With this reinvention of video games, the game industry reconnects with a general audience. Many of today's casual game players once enjoyed Pac-Man, Tetris, and other early games, only to drop out when video games became more time consuming and complex. For a long time, video games asked players to structure their lives to fit the demands of a game; with casual games, it is the game that is designed to fit into the lives of players. These flexible games make it possible for everyone to be a video game player.Juul shows that it is only by understanding what a game requires of players, what players bring to a game, how the game industry works, and how video games have developed historically that we can understand what makes video games fun and why we choose to play (or not to play) them.},

abstract = {Meaning has been called the "holy grail" of a variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from linguistics to philosophy, psychology and the neurosciences. The field of Artifical Intelligence (AI) is very much a part of that list: the development of sophisticated natural language semantics is a sine qua non for achieving a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Embodiment theories in cognitive science hold that human semantic representation depends on sensori-motor experience; the abundant evidence that human meaning representation is grounded in the perception of physical reality leads to the conclusion that meaning must depend on a fusion of multiple (perceptual) modalities. Despite this, AI research in general, and its subdisciplines such as computational linguistics and computer vision in particular, have focused primarily on tasks that involve a single modality. Here, we propose virtual embodiment as an alternative, long-term strategy for AI research that is multi-modal in nature and that allows for the kind of scalability required to develop the field coherently and incrementally, in an ethically responsible fashion.},

Furthermore, we propose a preprocessing method and present a new SVM model selection method, the combined leave-one-out cross-validation scheme with VC bound method. Accordingly, the SVM classifiers for five aircraft are designed. Their anti-noise performance and tolerance to aspect variation are compared with that of MCM (maximum correlation method). The experimental results indicate that the preprocessing procedure and model selection method are effective and the SVM method has potential in radar complex target classification},

abstract = {Player enjoyment is the single-most important goal of games. Games that are not enjoyable are not bought or played. Within games, enjoyment of the gameplay hinges on the game world. However, game worlds are often static and highly scripted, which leads to restricted and shallow gameplay that can detract from player enjoyment. It is possible that player enjoyment could be improved by the creation of more flexible game worlds that give players more freedom and control. One way to create more flexible game worlds is through the use of an emergent approach to designing game worlds. This thesis investigates an emergent approach to designing game worlds, as well as the issues, considerations, and implications for game players and developers. The research reported in this thesis consisted of three parts. The first part involved conducting a focus group and questionnaire with players to address the research question: what issues exist for players interacting in game worlds and how do these issues correspond with those identified by game developers? The second part of the research, in which the Emergent Games Engine Technology (EmerGEnT) system was developed, involved investigating how game worlds can be made more open and emergent. The applicability of cellular automata to games was investigated, as was the extent to which they can facilitate emergent behaviour and gameplay. The test-bed for the EmerGEnT system was a strategy game world that was developed using a 3D games engine, the Auran Jet. The EmerGEnT system consists of three main parts: the environment, objects, and agents. The third part of the research involved evaluating the EmerGEnT system against a set of criteria for player enjoyment in games, which allowed the system's role in facilitating player enjoyment to be defined. The third part of the thesis investigated the extent to which the EmerGEnT system can facilitate player enjoyment in comparison to conventional scripted system and the ways in which the EmerGEnT system can facilitate player enjoyment. v In the player-centred studies, it was found that players are dissatisfied with the static, inconsistent and unrealistic elements of current games and that they desire more interactivity, realism and control. The development and testing of the EmerGEnT system showed that an emergent game world design, based on cellular automata, can facilitate emergent behaviour in a limited domain. The domain modelled by the EmerGEnT system was heat, fire, rain, fluid flow, pressure, and explosions in a strategy game world. The EmerGEnT system displayed advantages relating to its ability to dynamically determine and accommodate the specific state of the game world due to the underlying properties of the cells, objects, and agents. It also provided a model for emergent game worlds, which allowed more complexity than emergent objects alone. Finally, the evaluation of enjoyment revealed that incorporating an emergent game world (such as the EmerGEnT system) into a game could improve player enjoyment in terms of concentration, challenge, player skills, control, and feedback by allowing more intuitive, consistent, and emergent interactions with the game world. The implications of this research are that cellular automata can facilitate emergence in games, at least in a limited domain. Furthermore, emergence in games has the potential to enhance player enjoyment in areas where current game worlds are weak. Finally, the EmerGEnT system serves as a proof of concept of using emergence in games, provides a model for simulating environmental systems in games and was used to identify core issues and considerations for future development and research of emergent game worlds.},

abstract = {In this paper several methods for animacy recognition are evaluated. Each method has an increasing complexity over the previous one and involves more resources, and as a result, more computation. When assessing the performace of these methods we consider three factors: the results of an intrinsic evaluation, the results of an extrinsic evaluation, and the complexity of the method. For intrinsic evaluation the accuracy of the overall classification is considered as well as the precision and recall for each type classification. In the extrinsic evaluation, the animacy classifier is used to filter candidates in a pronominal anaphora resolution system. Given the wide variety of texts used, an anaphora resolution system could not be used for this evaluation because its performance depends upon the genre of the text being processed. For this reason, the reduction of the number of candidates, the reduction of the number of antecedents, and the increase in the number of pronouns without any antecedents were recorded and used to differentiate between the systems. Comparison between different systems showed that the best one is the system which uses machine learning, and that the additional information brought by different modules does not lead to an increase in the success of the system due to the errors introduced by them.},

Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives.

"Understanding Digital Games" brings together all these perspectives to offer a unique survey of this highly multidisciplinary field. Each chapter looks at the key theoretical perspectives and provides a review of the relevant literatures in order to demonstrate their relevance to study of digital games. Each chapter also considers the potential limitations and problems associated with a particular theoretical or methodological approach. The content of each chapter is illustrated by the use of a game text or case study, and each includes a definition of key terms, a topic-specific bibliography, and suggestions for further reading.},

@article{Kang2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WDG. All rights reserved. Smart cities are required to engage with local communities by promoting a user-centred approach to deal with urban life issues and ultimately enhance people's quality of life. Soundscape promotes a similar approach, based on individuals' perception of acoustic environments. This paper aims to establish a model to implement soundscape maps for the monitoring and management of the acoustic environment and to demonstrate its feasibility. The final objective of the model is to generate visual maps related to perceptual attributes (e.g. 'calm', 'pleasant'), starting from audio recordings of everyday acoustic environments. The proposed model relies on three main stages: (1) sound sources recognition and profiling, (2) prediction of the soundscape's perceptual attributes and (3) implementation of soundscape maps. This research particularly explores the two latter phases, for which a set of sub-processes and methods is proposed and discussed. An accuracy analysis was performed with satisfactory results: the prediction models of the second stage explained up to the 57.5{\%} of the attribut es' variance; the cross-validation errors of the model were close to zero. These findings show that the proposed model is likely to produce representative maps of an individual's sonic perception in a given environment.},

@article{Stauffacher2006,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the transdisciplinary case study (TCS) as a learning framework based on what we call functional socio-cultural constructivism and project-based learning (PBL). In doing so, the paper attempts to illustrate the applicability of TCS to learn competencies and skills necessary to research problems of sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach – TCS is considered a learning framework based on the principle of self-regulated learning; i.e. students must actively deal with the requirements as well as plan and execute their project work within their own worldviews and goals. TCS methods are essential as we tackle complex real-world problems. Findings – The paper discusses challenges and obstacles of such an approach and present lessons learned since 1994, on both the viewpoints of students and of teachers. It conclude that case study learning is a demanding task, especially in a transdisciplinary context where more challenges emerge than in PBL, since goals of teachers, case agents, and students have to be balanced. Practical implications – TCS or courses like it are important for universities at the present time. Under present budget restrictions and a wide-ranging mistrust of society toward universities, there is a necessity for a new contract between society and research: students should learn to take over responsibility in societal contexts and be able to communicate beyond the “ivory tower”. Originality/value – The learning goals of TCS differ from the goals of most university courses. They are more comprehensive and include complex problem solving, societal context, and group processes. The ambitious goal is that students become enabled to tackle complex, real-world problems.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a formal mode of representation and a corresponding way of thinking about institutionalized social action. It draws its representational technique and its way of thinking about its subject from several sources, including systems theory, cognitive science, and structuralism. It is based on the idea that a model involves a proposed generative mechanism for observable patterns of action and that such a generator must be a system of rules. We discuss the philosophical and sociological presuppositions of our proposal, then outline in detail and illustrate the idea of a production system model. Following this, we argue that the proposed mode of representation is appropriate for “the action frame of reference” and then develop a series of specific “problematics” involving the structural analysis of institutionalized social action. We conclude with a discussion of issues and problems for further research. The paper does not include mathematical work found elsewhere, although it tries to indicate its significance. Similarly, it does not include data analyses reported elsewhere, although it tries to show that the models make definite predictions about certain forms of data. In short, the paper strives to be a readable introduction to the conceptual foundations of a line of investigation.},

Older adult models fit keystroke-level performance at the aggregate grain of analysis extremely well (R = 0.99) and produced equivalent fits to previously validated younger adult models. Critical path analyses highlighted points of poor design as a function of cognitive workload, hardware/software design, and user characteristics.

abstract = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

The focus of this chapter is overwhelmingly on the third heading, that of tools. These in turn divide, roughly, into tools for analyzing data, tools for constructing and evaluating models, and tools for measuring complexity. I discuss the principles of statistical learning and model selection; time series analysis; cellular automata; agent-based models; the evaluation of complex-systems models; information theory; and ways of measuring complexity. Throughout, I give only rough outlines of techniques, so that readers, confronted with new problems, will have a sense of which ones might be suitable, and which ones definitely are not.},

The complete framework will analyse the voice, the face and the body of the player to have a general description of the emotion the child is feeling/trying to play. In this work the focus is on the body movement analysis. A set of 2D and 3D features is introduced and Dictionary Learning is described as a possible method to help classifying emotions.

abstract = {On the 30th anniversary of Premack and Woodruff's seminal paper asking whether chimpanzees have a theory of mind, we review recent evidence that suggests in many respects they do, whereas in other respects they might not. Specifically, there is solid evidence from several different experimental paradigms that chimpanzees understand the goals and intentions of others, as well as the perception and knowledge of others. Nevertheless, despite several seemingly valid attempts, there is currently no evidence that chimpanzees understand false beliefs. Our conclusion for the moment is, thus, that chimpanzees understand others in terms of a perception-goal psychology, as opposed to a full-fledged, human-like belief-desire psychology.},

abstract = {A proposal for the biological grounding of intrinsic teleology and sense-making through the theory of autopoiesis is critically evaluated. Autopoiesis provides a systemic language for speaking about intrinsic teleology but its original formulation needs to be elaborated further in order to explain sense-making. This is done by introducing adaptivity, a many-layered property that allows organisms to regulate themselves with respect to their conditions of viability. Adaptivity leads to more articulated concepts of behaviour, agency, sense- construction, health, and temporality than those given so far by autopoiesis and enaction. These and other implications for understanding the organismic generation of values are explored.},

abstract = {The term embodiment identifies a theory that meaning and semantics cannot be captured by abstract, logical systems, but are dependent on an agent's experience derived from being situated in an environment. This theory has recently received a great deal of support in the cognitive science literature and is having significant impact in artificial intelligence. Memetics refers to the theory that knowledge and ideas can evolve more or less independently of their human-agent substrates. While humans provide the medium for this evolution, memetics holds that ideas can be developed without human comprehension or deliberate interference. Both theories have profound implications for the study of language—its potential use by machines, its acquisition by children and of particular relevance to this special issue, its evolution. This article links the theory of memetics to the established literature on semantic space, then examines the extent to which these memetic mechanisms might account for language independently of embodiment. It then seeks to explain the evolution of language through uniquely human cognitive capacities which facilitate memetic evolution.},

The participants comprised 16 adult female casual-gamers who completed two self-report online interviews (at the beginning and at the end of the study) and participated in an online blog/diary and discussion forum over a four-week period. The data were analysed for salient themes using Thematic Analysis. Results showed areas that were important to female casual-gamers included knowledge peripheral to games, domestic commitments and personal priorities influenced by gaming, and the social, financial, and emotional investment of games. By exploring the prominent themes underlying women{\&}rsquo;s motivations to play casual games, the results provided potential new research directions for future research on women gamers from positively gendered perspectives.},

This study explored the social interactions that occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. The sample consisted of 912 self-selected MMORPG players from 45 countries. MMORPGs were found to be highly socially interactive environments providing the opportunity to create strong friendships and emotional relationships. The study demonstrated that the social interactions in online gaming form a considerable element in the enjoyment of playing. The study showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with high percentages of gamers making life-long friends and partners. It was concluded that virtual gaming may allow players to express themselves in ways they may not feel comfortable doing in real life because of their appearance, gender, sexuality, and/or age.

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the problems of modern representative democracy and we look at the random selection of legislators as an extreme form of the proportional political representation, arguing that it is the way to make representative democracy as close to direct democracy as possible. In this respect we present a new mathematical model which attempts at describing a more efficient parliament where part of the members are selected by lot. It will be shown that starting from a parliament working with two parties (or coalitions), where the costs of representative democracy are quite apparent, one can beneficially move towards a parliament where independent legislators, randomly selected from the population of constituents, sit alongside with party members. The paper shows that increasing the number of independent legislators up to a point enhances the efficiency of the parliament.},

abstract = {Dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by antipsychotic drugs has been measured with positron emission tomography (PET) by comparing the binding potential (BP) values before and after drug administration. This occupancy has been found to be related to clinical effects and side effects. In this study, we evaluated the uncertainty of the quantitative analysis for estimating the dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by antipsychotics in simulation and human studies of [(11)C]raclopride and for the high affinity ligand [(11)C]FLB 457. Time-activity curves of [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457 were simulated, and the reliability of BP estimated by a simplified reference tissue model and the calculated occupancy were investigated for various noise levels, BP values, and scan durations. Then, in the human PET study with and without antipsychotics, the uncertainty of BP and occupancy estimates and the scan duration required for a reliable estimation were investigated by a bootstrap approach. Reliable and unbiased estimates of [(11)C]raclopride BP(ND) could be obtained with recording as short as 32 min, with the relative standard deviation (SD) of the striatal occupancy remaining less than 10{\%}. Conversely, in [(11)C]FLB 457 studies, the mean value increased and SD of the temporal cortex and thalamus exceeded 10{\%} when the scan duration was shorter than 60 min. These results demonstrated that dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by antipsychotics can be estimated precisely with an optimal scan duration with [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457.},

abstract = {Serious games have recently enjoyed unprecedented interest among researchers. Despite the fact that the main focus of this domain remains on player entertainment and engagement, serious games have established themselves as an alternative educational paradigm. However, little interest has been given to investigating methods for the assessment of their effectiveness. Game evaluation focus remains on investigating usability and technical aspects. Those attempting to evaluate the educational impact typically rely on traditional questionnaires that typically negatively affecting user immersion and the overall game enjoyment. Among game genres, Interactive Digital Storytelling (IDS) is a fast growing genre that merges computer games, multimedia and cinematic storytelling with entertaining education. Like any other teaching intervention, educational IDS's have to be evaluated against a defined set of Learning Objectives (LOs). In this paper we present a User-Centred Seamless Evaluation Framework for IDS games and describe the algorithm for the integration of knowledge assessment to measure knowledge improvement against given LOs without affecting player enjoyment. We implement this algorithm in an educational game and show that the framework has been perceived by the majority of the players as a positive enhancement to the game, 94{\%} of the participants reported preferring this form of assessment as opposed to the more “traditional” methods. Statistically significant knowledge improvements were obtained after the game play.},

abstract = {Responding to the paucity of institutional literature which meaningfully distinguishes between emotional displays and the experience of emotions, I describe the process by which display rules are codified into the logics governing an institutional regime. I then theorize the role of feigning behaviors, or emotional displays which are decoupled from the physiological experience of emotion either in intensity or valence (positive/negative), in the higher-order dynamics of institutional logics. Specifically, I suggest that the two categories of feigning behavior (valence congruous feigning and diametric feigning) can play different roles in catalyzing the coexistence, blending, and contestation of logics. This research aids institutional theorists in understanding the local affairs and ‘on-the-ground' lived experiences of logics through highlighting the role of feigned emotional display as the ubiquitous mechanism through which persons navigate and cope with institutional mandates.

abstract = {Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.},

The Nature of Design, on the other hand, is about starting things, specifically an ecological design revolution that changes how we provide food, shelter, energy, materials, and livelihood, and how we deal with waste. Ecological design is an emerging field that aims to recalibrate what humans do in the world according to how the world works as a biophysical system. Design in this sense is a large concept having to do as much with politics and ethics as with buildings and technology. The book begins by describing the scope of design, comparing it to the Enlightenment of the 18th century. Subsequent chapters describe barriers to a design revolution inherent in our misuse of language, the clockspeed of technological society, and shortsighted politics. Orr goes on to describe the critical role educational institutions might play in fostering design intelligence and what he calls "a higher order of heroism." Appropriately, the book ends on themes of charity, wilderness, and the rights of children. Astute yet broadly appealing, The Nature of Design combines theory, practicality, and a call to action.},

The intentional binding effect refers to the subjective compression of the temporal interval between a voluntary action and its external sensory consequence. Since the first report, considerable interest has been generated and a fascinating array of studies has accumulated. Much of the interest in intentional binding comes from the promise to shed light on human agency. In this review we survey studies on intentional binding, focusing, in particular, on the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency (the experience of controlling action to influence events in the environment). We suggest that, whilst it is yet to be fully explicated, the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency is compelling. We conclude by considering outstanding questions and future directions for research on intentional binding.},

Our approach exploits a well-founded, declarative model of action and intention (Young, Pollack and Moore 1994, Young, Moore and Pollack, 1994) applied to virtual world contexts, in combination with new computational models of narrative structure.

abstract = {The commercial games industry is struggling to find a form of narrative for single-player story-based games that takes advantage of the medium. Current methods are limited to structured narrative or simulation, both of which have serious game design constraints. Drama Management represents a potential new model. This talk will cover the author's research into bringing interactive storytelling to single-player story games. Focusing on the design and production needs of current titles, different groups of penand- paper RPG Game Masters were studied, and their interactive narrative approach was algorithmically replicated for video game storytelling on a per-encounter level. To verify these results, an “Encounter Manager” pen-and-paper algorithm was tested in place of a human Game Master, achieving similar storytelling results and exposing new conclusions. Implementing these techniques in several video game projects has shown diverse payoffs, not just in narrative, replayability, and pacing but also in risk-reduction, art production, open world and linear level design, and new game genres. However, the uncertainty and risk of a new model of game production combined with the lack of a driving need in commercial games has so far proven a major hurdle for this approach. Looking forward, similarities with other procedural narrative efforts are explored, and future steps are proposed.},

abstract = {We present POAPS, a novel planning system for defining Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) that abstracts away from POMDP details for the benefit of non-expert practitioners. POAPS includes an expressive adaptive programming language based on Lisp that has constructs for choice points that can be dynamically optimized. Non-experts can use our language to write adaptive programs that have partially observable components without needing to specify belief/hidden states or reason about probabilities. POAPS is also a compiler that defines and performs the transformation of any program written in our language into a POMDP with control knowledge. We demonstrate the generality and power of POAPS in the rapidly growing domain of human computation by describing its expressiveness and simplicity by writing several POAPS programs for common crowdsourcing tasks.},

abstract = {The year was 1945. Two earth-shaking events took place: the successful test at Alamogordo and the building of the first electronic computer. Their combined impact was to modify qualitatively the nature of global interactions between Russia and the West. No less perturbative were the changes wrought in all of academic research and in applied science. On a less grand scale these events brought about a renascence of a mathematical technique known to the old guard as statistical sampling; in its new surroundings and owing to its nature, there was no denying its new name of the Monte Carlo method. This essay attempts to describe the details that led to this renascence and the roles played by the various actors. It is appropriate that it appears in an issue dedicated to Stan Ulam.},

abstract = {Search based procedural content generation uses search techniques to locate high-quality content elements for use in games. This study extends an evolutionary-computation based system to generate tiles used to assemble floor plans for levels in a video game as well as evolving assembly plans. The separate evolution of assembly plans and tiles yields a decomposition of the level generation problem that saves substantial time. The tiles used in this study use a more sophisticated fitness function than earlier studies and also permit the user to specify features, e.g. rooms of a particular shape or short or long transit distances between two points in the tile. Evolutionary computation is used as an off-line tool to generate libraries of both tiles and assembly plans. Systems for rapidly assembling tile libraries can then be used to generate large levels on demand with combinatorially huge numbers of level plans available. The new fitness function can be used to control the topology of the tiles and optionally permits the incorporation of enforced symmetry in tiles. Symmetric tiles are found to have a visually striking appearance. Control is achieved by requesting that different pairwise distances between user-specified checkpoints be minimized, maximized, or left free. This study explores the new fitness functions and demonstrates the variety of tiles that can be generated as well as assembling exemplary level plans from those tiles.},

@article{Framework2009,
abstract = {Stories have been engaging humans for thousands of years, but in interactive narrative environments, the narrative is perceived to diminish as the source of engagement. One reason for this apparent diminution, is that in interactive environments there has been difficulty in understanding the relationship between the design of the unfolding story, and the ability of a user within the story world to alter the course of events. As yet there are no standard or accepted evaluative methods to understand interaction at a granular level, and to understand how stories and narratives flow across the expanse of technologies and mixed realities that characterise the way people communicate, share knowledge and are entertained. This thesis presents a novel methodology called the Four-Factor Framework, that takes as its premise that there are four fundamental elements in interactive stories and narratives that can be observed. The Four-Factor Framework facilitates the evaluation of interaction and stories by mapping the dynamic connections between the four fundamental elements: agency, drama, narrative and engagement. A key innovation of this work is the observation and measurement of change in these four elements as a story develops through user interaction and story design. This perspective has not previously been demonstrated. The results of this study indicate that the Four-Factor Framework methodology does facilitate the observation and measurement of the fundamental elements. Furthermore, the data collected using the methodology suggests strong and novel associations between agency, drama, narrative and engagement.},

While many institutional features can account for this failure, a prominent one is the lack of meritocracy in the selection and rewarding of managers.

abstract = {Racket is a descendant of Lisp, a programming language renowned for its elegance, power, and challenging learning curve. But while Racket retains the functional goodness of Lisp, it was designed with beginning programmers in mind. Realm of Racket is your introduction to the Racket language. In Realm of Racket, you'll learn to program by creating increasingly complex games. Your journey begins with the Guess My Number game and coverage of some basic Racket etiquette. Next you'll dig into syntax and semantics, lists, structures, and conditionals, and learn to work with recursion and the GUI as you build the Robot Snake game. After that it's on to lambda and mutant structs (and an Orc Battle), and fancy loops and the Dice of Doom. Finally, you'll explore laziness, AI, distributed games, and the Hungry Henry game. As you progress through the games, chapter checkpoints and challenges help reinforce what you've learned. Offbeat comics keep things fun along the way. As you travel through the Racket realm, you'll: Master the quirks of Racket's syntax and semanticsLearn to write concise and elegant functional programsCreate a graphical user interface using the 2htdp/image libraryCreate a server to handle true multiplayer gamesRealm of Racket is a lighthearted guide to some serious programming.

In this paper, we describe the design of a data exploration language that makes the task more accessible by embedding advanced programming concepts into a simple core language. The core language uses type providers, but we employ them in a novel way - rather than providing types with members for accessing data, we provide types with members that allow the user to also compose rich and correct queries using just member access ("dot"). This way, we recreate functionality that usually requires complex type systems (row polymorphism, type state and dependent typing) in an extremely simple object-based language. We formalize our approach using an object-based calculus and prove that programs constructed using the provided types represent valid data transformations. We discuss a case study developed using the language, together with additional editor tooling that bridges some of the gaps between programming and spreadsheets. We believe that this work provides a pathway towards democratizing data science - our use of type providers significantly reduce the complexity of languages that one needs to understand in order to write scripts for exploring data.},

abstract = {Algorithmic recommender systems are a ubiquitous feature of contemporary cultural life online, suggesting music, movies, and other materials to their users. This article, drawing on fieldwork with developers of recommender systems in the US, describes a tendency among these systems' makers to describe their purpose as "hooking" people-enticing them into frequent or enduring usage. Inspired by steady references to capture in the field, I consider recommender systems as traps, drawing on anthropological theories about animal trapping. I chart the rise of "captivation metrics"-measures of user retention-enabled by a set of transformations in recommenders' epistemic, economic, and technical contexts. Traps prove useful for thinking about how such systems relate to broader infrastructural ecologies of knowledge and technology. As recommenders spread across online cultural infrastructures and become practically inescapable, thinking with traps offers an alternative to common ethical framings that oppose tropes of freedom and coercion.},

abstract = {A theory describing the development of alternating, dissociated, victim/masochistic and perpetrator/sadistic ego states in persons who grew up with abusive primary caretakers will be proposed and a paradigm for treatment will be derived from the theory. Alternating ego states can be observed throughout the spectrum of dissociative disorders, from Borderline Personality to Dissociative Identity Disorder. Dependence on an abusive caretaker creates a series of relational dilemmas for the child. To maintain attachment, abuse must be dissociated, but to protect the self from abuse, need for attachment must be disavowed. Disorganized attachment may result. Incompatible internal working models, using parallel masochistic and sadistic defensive strategies, may be developed and elaborated into ego states. Masochistic and sadistic defenses are ultimately maladaptive, because they require dissociation of need for either self-protection or attachment. Each defensive attempt at resolving a relational dilemma leads to another impasse, a change in defensive strategy, and perhaps a shift in ego state. When alternating ego states are understood as evolving from defensive schemas developed to negotiate the dilemmas of attachment to an abuser, the following therapeutic techniques can be derived: (1) identifying adaptive needs and maladaptive defenses, (2) interpreting ego state switches as attempts to resolve relational dilemmas, (3) gradually bridging dissociation between states, (4) using transference and countertransference to understand relational patterns, and (5) cultivating more adaptive interpersonal skills within the therapeutic relationship. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

abstract = {Submodular optimization is a special class of combinatorial optimization arising in several machine learning problems, but also in cooperative control of complex systems. In this paper, we consider agents in an asynchronous, unreliable and time-varying directed network that aim at cooperatively solving submodular minimization problems in a fully distributed way. The challenge is that the (submodular) objective set-function is only partially known by agents, that is, each one is able to evaluate the function only for subsets including itself. We propose a distributed algorithm based on a proper linear programming reformulation of the combinatorial problem. Our algorithm builds on a column generation approach in which each agent maintains a local candidate basis and locally generates columns with a suitable greedy inner routine. A key interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is that the pricing problem, which involves an exponential number of constraints, is solved by the agents through a polynomial time greedy algorithm. We prove that the proposed distributed algorithm converges in finite time to an optimal solution of the submodular minimization problem and we corroborate the theoretical results by performing numerical computations on instances of the {\$}s{\$}--{\$}t{\$} minimum graph cut problem.},

abstract = {Narrative structure models are useful tools for understanding how and why narratives of any medium affect an audience's level of participation in their role of story reconstruction and understanding. [14] With the advent of the computer comes the potential to negotiate through many such models and variables within models as a means of generating multiple narratives quickly and semi-autonomously. The computational narrative model presented in this paper offers one approach to narrative generation, that of splitting the task into three functional areas: 1) defining an abstract narrative structure; 2) defining a collection and organization of story pieces with some representation of their meaning; and 3) a navigational strategy or reasoning through that collection of story pieces. Agent Stories is a story design and presentation environment for non-linear, multiple-point-ofview cinematic stories. It is designed to be placed in the hands of the non-linear story writer to use as a tool to promote structuring and re-writing of non-linear narratives before and as they are realized in audio and video.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Why, if at all, does it make sense to assign some responsibilities to states rather than to individuals? There are two contemporary answers. According to the agential theory, states can be held responsible because they are moral agents, much like human beings. According to the functional theory, states can be held responsible because they are legal persons that act vicariously through individuals, much like principals who act through agents. The two theories of state responsibility belong to parallel traditions of scholarship that have never been clearly distinguished. While the agential theory is dominant in IR, political theory, and philosophy, the functional theory prevails in International Law. The purpose of this article is to bridge the gulf between ethical and legal approaches to state responsibility. I argue that IR scholars and political theorists have much to gain from the functional theory. First, it provides a plausible alternative to the agential theory that avoids common objections to corporate moral agency. Second, the functional theory helps us to understand features of International Law that have puzzled IR scholars and political theorists, such as the fact that states are not held criminally responsible. I suggest that states can be ‘moral principals' instead of moral agents.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This book is an introduction to the methodology of agent-based modeling (ABM) and how it can help us more deeply understand the natural and social worlds and engineer solutions to societal problems. Before we discuss why agent-based modeling is impor-tant, we briefly describe what agent-based modeling is. An agent is an autonomous computational individual or object with particular properties and actions. Agent-based modeling is a form of computational modeling whereby a phenomenon is modeled in terms of agents and their interactions. We will describe ABM more comprehensively in chapter 1. As you will see in this textbook, ABM is a methodology that can be promiscuously applied — there are few, if any, content areas where ABM is not appli-cable. It can enable us to explore, make sense of, and analyze phenomena and sce-narios across a wide variety of contexts and content domains. In the past two decades, scientists have increasingly used agent-based modeling methods to conduct their research. The main argument of this introductory chapter is that ABM is a transformative repre-sentational technology that enables us to better understand familiar topics, and at younger ages; make sense of and analyze hitherto unexplored topics; and enable a democratization of access to computational tools for making sense of complexity and change. As such, we believe that developing ABM literacy is a powerful professional and life skill for students, and we should strive for universal ABM literacy for all, from young students to professionals. 0 2 Chapter 0 This textbook is a foray in the direction of such ABM literacy, aimed at undergraduate and graduate students in virtually any domain of study. To achieve universal ABM literacy, we foresee a need for many complementary such textbooks and materials aimed at a wide variety of people, topics, and social niches. ABM is a species of computation, growing up alongside the maturation of computer technology. The advent of powerful computation has brought about dramatic change in many areas of life, including significant changes in the practice and content of science. As access to powerful computation increases (and its cost deceases), scientists are able to perform calculations and simulations that simply were not possible in the past. The increase in computational power and connectivity has also enabled the collection and analysis of very large data sets. These data sets often include data at micro-scale levels, enabling us to extract more insight as to how individuals in society behave, animals in an ecosystem survive, or elements of an engineered system affect each other. The combination of large data, cheap computation, and high connectivity allows agent-based models to be constructed with millions of individual agents whose properties and behaviors have been validated. Moreover, computational representations are dynamic and executable, allowing for greater interactivity between the user and representation. Perhaps, even more important, agent-based representations have particular advantages in that they are easy for people to understand. Agent-based representations are easier to understand than mathematical representations of the same phenomenon. This is because agent-based models are constructed out of individual objects and simple rules for their movement of behavior, as opposed to equa-tional models that are constructed from mathematical symbols. In our natural discourse, we commonly describe our experience in terms of the interactions of individuals, as opposed to in terms of the rates of change of aggregates as in differential equations. In thinking about individual agents, we can make sense of them by projecting our bodily experience onto the agents. Thus, the language and concepts we use in agent-based model-ing is much closer to natural language and our natural thinking. But, to a great extent, these dramatic changes in representation and in the practice of science have not resulted in significant change in the world of education. There are many reasons for the slow pace of change in " technology transfer " to the education system. One obstacle is the lack of widespread understanding of the benefits of such a transfer. In this chapter, we develop a conceptualization of this enterprise in historical and epistemological terms that we hope will situate ABM with respect to other representational advances and increase understanding of the benefits of widespread adoption. As a first step to presenting this conceptualization, we look back historically at changes to representational tools and practices used in science and the significant benefits they had for both scientists and learners. The example that we have found most useful in presenting our idea is the shift from Roman to Hindu-Arabic numerals in arithmetic. We believe it is important to study more systematically changes of this kind, to examine the history of},

We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.},

abstract = {This paper examined the emotional impact that engaging in or witnessing Symbolic Taboo Activities (STAs), as represented in MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing game), such as killing, torture and rape, has on adults. We focused our study on two games: World of Warcraft and Sociolotron. The study employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), which was chosen because of its emphasis on 'lived experienced' and how participants make sense of their experiences. Five participants, all over the age of 18 years, were interviewed via Instant Messenger, four of which were men. Most of our participants felt they could easily separate gamespace from the real world; however, when asked to examine specific actions in-depth, we found this was not the case for all STAs. Activities that did not have a sanctioned equivalence (e.g., rape) were found by most to be more difficult to separate, especially emotionally. However, this was not the case for all participants. The findings suggest that not all individuals can psychologically cope with engaging in and/or witnessing certain STAs in MMORPGs. The results, we believe are important for game designers, censoring bodies of video games and psychologists. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Interactive Narrative is an approach to interactive entertainment that enables the player to make decisions that directly affect the direction and/or outcome of the narrative experience being delivered by the computer system. Interactive narrative requires two seemingly conflicting requirements: coherent narrative and user agency. We present an interactive narrative system that uses a combination of narrative control and autonomous believable character agents to augment a story world simulation in which the user has a high degree of agency with narrative plot control. A drama manager called the Automated Story Director gives plot-based guidance to believable agents. The believable agents are endowed with the autonomy necessary to carry out directives in the most believable fashion possible. Agents also handle interaction with the user. When the user performs actions that change the world in such a way that the Automated Story Director can no longer drive the intended narrative forward, it is able to adapt the plot to incorporate the user's changes and still achieve dramatic goals.},

abstract = {This paper compares within the MAS framework two separate threads in the formal study of epistemic change: belief revision and argumentation theories. Belief revision describes how an agent is supposed to change his own mind, while argumentation deals with persuasive strategies employed to change the mind of other agents. These are two sides (cognitive and social) of the same epistemic coin: argumentation theories are incomplete, if they cannot be grounded in belief revision models – and vice versa. Nonetheless, so far the formal treatment of belief revision mostly neglected any systematic comparison with argumentation theories. In MAS such problem becomes evident and inescapable: belief change is usually triggered by communication and persuasion from other agents, involving deception, trust, reputation, negotiation, conflict resolution (all typical issues faced by argumentation-based models). Therefore, a closer comparison between belief revision and argumentation is a necessary preliminary step towards an integrated model of epistemic change in MAS.},

The theory and technologies developed with these aims are encapsulated under the rubric of the Advanced Identity Representation (AIR) Project that initiated in the Imagination, Computation, and Expression Laboratory (ICE Lab) directed by the author. This work has a basis in the cognitive science foundations of categorisation and metaphor-based bias, and study of social classification infrastructures from sociology of science. Using this theoretical framework, this article provides a model to reveal a set of inadequacies of many current identity infrastructures in social computing and gaming systems for supporting the needs of collective groups of people and individuals in marginalised categories. As results, several social networking systems and games developed in the ICE Lab to empower users in the creative goal of constructing computational identities and/or critiquing the phenomenon of stigma in these applications are presented.

abstract = {Pattern recognition has as its objective to classify objects into different categories and classes. It is a fundamental component of artificial intelligence and computer vision. This thesis investigates the application of an efficient optimization method, known as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to the field of pattern recognition and image processing. First a clustering method that is based on PSO is proposed. The application of the proposed clustering algorithm to the problem of unsupervised classification and segmentation of images is investigated. A new automatic image generation tool tailored specifically for the verification and comparison of various unsupervised image classification algorithms is then developed. A dynamic clustering algorithm which automatically determines the "optimum" number of clusters and simultaneously clusters the data set with minimal user interference is then developed. Finally, PSO-based approaches are proposed to tackle the color image quantization and spectral unmixing problems. In all the proposed approaches, the influence of PSO parameters on the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated.

Multi-agent systems are a natural choice to design organisational systems due to the proactive and autonomous behaviour of agents. However, in business environments it is necessary to consider the behaviour of the global system and the collective aspects of the domain. In this paper, we argue that multi-agent systems should be designed around organisational co-ordination frameworks that reflect the co-ordination structures of the particular organisation. As in human societies, we argue that norms and institutions are a way for agent societies to cope with the challenge of social order. Through institutions, conventions and interaction patterns for the co-ordination of agents can be specified, monitored and managed.},

@phdthesis{KarinKipperSchuler2005,
abstract = {Despite the proliferation of approaches to lexicon development, the eld of natural language processing has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for computational verb lexicons, which has severely limited their utility in information processing applications. James Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon has concentrated on nouns rather than verbs. WordNet does not provide a comprehensive account of possible syntactic frames and predicate argument structures associated with individual verb senses and ComLex provides syntactic frames but ignores sense distinctions. Dorr's LCS lexicon attempts to address these limitations, but does not provide broad coverage of syntactic frames or different senses or links to actual instances in corpora. In order to address this gap, we created VerbNet, a verb lexicon compatible with WordNet but with explicitly stated syntactic and semantic information, using Levin verb classes to systematically construct lexical entries. Classes are hierarchically organized to ensure that all their members have common semantic and syntactic properties. Each class in the hierarchy is characterized extensionally by its set of verbs, and intensionally by syntactic frames and semantic predicates and a list of typical verb arguments. One of VerbNet's primary applications has been as a basis for Parameterized Action Representations (PARs), which are used to animate the actions of virtual human agents in a simulated 3D environment. In order to support the animation of the actions, PARs have to make explicit many details that are often underspecied in the language. This detailed level of representation also provides a suitable pivot representation for generation in other natural languages, i.e., a form of interlingua. To evaluate VerbNet's syntactic coverage it has been mapped to the Proposition Bank. VerbNet syntactic frames account for over 84{\%} exact matches to the frames found in PropBank. VerbNet provides mappings between its verbs and WordNet senses and between its verbs and FrameNet II frames, and mappings between the syntactic frames and Xtag tree families. All these resources are complementary and can be used as extensions of each other. The original set of classes described by Levin has been refined and extended in many ways through systematic efforts: the coverage experiment against PropBank corpus instances proposed a large set of new syntactic frames and a better treatment of prepositions; new classes from Korhonen and Briscoe's resource were integrated into the lexicon; and new members from the LCS database were added. Taking advantage of VerbNet's class-based approach automatic acquisition methods were investigated. Additional verbs derived from Kingsbury's clustering experiments and from Loper's VerbNet-WordNet correlation experiment were integrated into the lexicon. These experiments show that it is possible to semi-automatically supplement and tune VerbNet with novel information from corpus data. These approaches reduce the manual classication and enable easy adaptation of the lexicon to specific tasks and applications.},

are, in principle, special cases of a dynamical system model based on our
previously reported framework of generalized growth transforms. The framework
shows that different dynamics arise as a result of minimizing a population
energy such that the population as a whole evolves to reach the most stable
state. By introducing a population dependent time-constant in the generalized
growth transform model, the proposed framework can be used to explain a vast
repertoire of evolutionary dynamics, including some novel forms of game

@article{Kahn2017,
abstract = {The modernist ideal of liberal constitutionalism affords jurisdiction a special place as the organizing principle behind the distribution of official state power. Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to the intricate spatial infrastructures that give jurisdiction its form. In this article, I argue that the complex architectures that undergird various jurisdictional registers combine to segment material and virtual landscapes into historically specific, multilayered geographies of discretion, dictating where, when, and to whom various institutions are permitted to speak the law. Looking to politicized litigation and advocacy over the rights of Haitian asylum seekers in the United States, I demonstrate how battles over jurisdictional cartographies can both instantiate and remake the spatiality of nation-states and the cosmologies of liberal sovereignty on which they rest.},

Rather than instructing the industry the proper use of design patterns, it aims identify the things academics can do to improve the practical value of design pattern libraries. It argues that design pattern libraries should depart from a clearly defined theoretical core that creates an informative lens on a particular aspect of game design. Patterns should prescribe generic solutions to common problems. Finally, in order to create libraries with a large expressive range, the number of patterns is of less importance than the number of interactions between the patterns.},

@book{Grosz2001,
abstract = {To be outside allows one a fresh perspective on the inside. In these essays, philosopher Elizabeth Grosz explores the ways in which two disciplines that are fundamentally outside each anotherarchitecture and philosophycan meet in a third space to interact free of their internal constraints. "Outside" also refers to those whose voices are not usually heard in architectural discourse but who inhabit its spacethe destitute, the homeless, the sick, and the dying, as well as women and minorities.Grosz asks how we can understand space differently in order to structure and inhabit our living arrangements accordingly. Two themes run throughout the book: temporal flow and sexual specificity. Grosz argues that time, change, and emergence, traditionally viewed as outside the concerns of space, must become more integral to the processes of design and construction. She also argues against architectures historical indifference to sexual specificity, asking what the existence of (at least) two sexes has to do with how we understand and experience space. Drawing on the work of such philosophers as Henri Bergson, Roger Caillois, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and Jacques Lacan, Grosz raises abstract but nonformalistic questions about space, inhabitation, and building. All of the essays propose philosophical experiments to render space and building more mobile and dynamic.},

abstract = {European philosophy from the late seventeenth century through most of the eighteenth is broadly conceived as `the Enlightenment', the period of empirical reaction to the great seventeenth century Rationalists.This volume begins with Herbert of Cherbury and the Cambridge Platonists and with Newton and the early English Enlightenment. Locke is a key figure in late chapters, as a result of his importance both in the development of British and Irish philosophy and because of his seminal influence in the Enlightenment as a whole. British Philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment includes discussion of Scottish Enlightenment and its influence on the German Aufklarung, and consequently on Kant. French thought, which in turn affected the late radical Enlightenment, especially Bentham, is also considered here.This survey brings together clear, authoritative chapters from leading experts and provides a scholarly introduction to this period in the history of philosophy. It includes a glossary of technical terms and a chronological table of important political, philosophical, scientific and other cultural events.},

This analysis contrast with the traditional lattice Boltzmann work, where complex fluids are considered with extended properties. Focus of the current thesis is on the validation and use of lattice Boltzmann method for traditional fluid dynamics. In first part of the document a historical and theoretical background of lattice Boltzmann method is presented. In this part some conclusions are drawn about the stability and other physical characteristics of the lattice Boltzmann method. Second part deals with the computer implementation of the LBM. It also discusses some aspect about practical usage of this method as a CFD tool. Boundary conditions are discussed in the same sections. Different method for boundary conditions and their numerical characteristics are presented. In the last section two numerical case studies are given for the lattice Boltzmann. Purpose of these numerical studies is to validate lattice Boltzmann method for traditional CFD application. Results of this numerical studies also reveals some facts about the physical aspect of lattice Boltzmann method.},

@article{Pearlman2013,
abstract = {In any political setting, a few people will defy political authority. The main challenge for theories of rebellion is to explain when and why others join en masse. Scholarship on social movements typically develops answers to this puzzle on the basis of either of two microfoundations. Explanations that conceptualize individuals as utility-maximizers contend that they protest as a means to other ends. Explanations that see individuals as driven by values and beliefs suggest that people protest for the inherent benefit of voicing dissent. Both perspectives generate compelling explanations. Yet how do purposeful individuals act when utilitarian calculations and cherished values recommend contrary courses of action? Why might an actor prioritize one or the other at different points in time? Taking on these questions, I argue for an approach to microfoundations that focuses on emotions. Emotions such as fear, sadness, and shame promote pessimistic assessments, risk aversion, and a low sense of control. Such dispiriting emotions encourage individuals to prioritize security and resign to political circumstances, even when they contradict values of dignity. By contrast, anger, joy, and pride promote optimistic assessments, risk acceptance, and feelings of personal efficacy. Such emboldening emotions encourage prioritization of dignity and increase willingness to engage in resistance, even when it jeopardizes security. When instrumentality and values offer different answers to the question of whether to resign or rebel, therefore, emotions can shift individuals toward one or the other. I ground this argument in findings from the neurosciences and illustrate it with evidence from the 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the absence of an uprising in Algeria.},

abstract = {Learning, is both an emotional and cognitive process and according to researchers and teachers worldwide, when players are engaged in activities that are intrinsically motivating, they are more prone to demonstrate deep learning [1]. Since 1981 when Malone used digital games as a medium in order to analyze intrinsic motivation, digital games have been reported to stimulate the students' interest, while motivating them to deploy control, curiosity and imagination [2] [3]. Studies within our research grouping have shown that Digital Games Based Learning (DGBL) can have a positive effect on some of the core development needs of people with Intellectual disabilities and associated sensory impairments [4], [5] One current of interests is the expansion of DGBL activities on mobile platforms specifically designed for users with intellectual disabilities. The RECALL Project describes the development and evaluation of a novel route learning system for people with disabilities using location based services (on the Android OS) and is the output of a EU award (504970-LLP-1-2009-1-UK-KA3-KA3MP). In the following paper we will present piloting findings from the piloting use of RouteMate application as well as an initial proposal of a playful location based DGBL integration in the educational experience of users with intellectual disabilities.},

abstract = {The Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse (18981979) studied with Martin Heidegger at Freiburg University from 1928 to 1932 and completed a dissertation on Hegels theory of historicity under Heideggers supervision. During these years, Marcuse wrote a number of provocative philosophical essays experimenting with the possibilities of Heideggerian Marxism. For a time he believed that Heideggers ideas could revitalize Marxism, providing a dimension of experiential concreteness that was sorely lacking in the German Idealist tradition. Ultimately, two events deterred Marcuse from completing this program: the 1932 publication of Marxs early economic and philosophical manuscripts, and Heideggers conversion to Nazism a year later. Heideggerian Marxism offers rich and fascinating testimony concerning the first attempt to fuse Marxism and existentialism.These essays offer invaluable insight concerning Marcuses early philosophical evolution. They document one of the centurys most important Marxist philosophers attempting to respond to the crisis of Marxism: the failure of the European revolution coupled with the growing repression in the USSR. In response, Marcuse contrived an imaginative and original theoretical synthesis: existential Marxism.},

@article{Bicchieri2014,
abstract = {Societies are rife with negative, damaging practices, from open defecation to female genital cutting, endemic in many developing countries, to corruption and violence against women and children that we also witness in many Western societies. The theoretical and practical challenge we face is twofold. On the one hand, we want to explain what generates and supports such practices. On the other, we want to find ways to change them permanently. We will argue here that social norms play an important role in both tasks. Often norms support or embed certain practices, so that eliminating the latter involves changing the former. Sometimes, however, norms have to be created in order to eliminate a negative practice and support a new one, as we know of several widely practiced behaviors that are not supported by norms, but can be changed by introducing them. To understand what we mean by 'practice' and 'norm', we shall next refer to Bicchieri (2006) definition of social norms, a definition that allows to shed light on the way norms are supported, and on ways we may act to change them.},

Analyzing lengthy life-narrative interviews of late-midlife adults, we examined the extent to which a particular kind of life story is empirically linked to self-report measures of generativity and other indices of psychosocial adaptation in midlife. The results showed that highly generative adults are significantly more likely than their less-generative counterparts to construe their lives as variations on a prototypical redemption narrative, wherein the story's protagonist (a) enjoys an early advantage in life, (b) exhibits sensitivity to the suffering of other people, (c) develops a clear moral framework, (d) repeatedly transforms negative scenes into positive outcomes, and (e) pursues prosocial goals for the future. The psychological and cultural features of redemptive life stories are considered, as are the problems and potentialities of life-narrative research in psychological science.},

abstract = {We have investigated the use of continuous alternatives for action selection by a behavior-oriented agent. Such an agent is made of concurrent "behaviors"; each of these behaviors reacts to specific stimuli and provides a response according to a low-level goal. Since the behaviors are specialized, they can provide concurrent responses and conflicts among them must be solved to perform a coherent global behavior of the agent. In this context, voting methods allow to select only one of the responses of the behaviors, while taking into account their preferences and respecting all of their constraints. Previous works are based on action spaces limited to few discrete values and have shown difficulties in determining the behaviors weights for the vote. Furthermore, these works generally not allow to express the indifference of a behavior on a alternative's component, i.e. the fact that a behavior has no preference on the value of one component of an alternative. We propose in this article a method to use continuous values for the alternatives and a fair vote based on one alternative proposition per behavior. Our framework also allows the expression of indifference between alternatives. This proposition has been tested and compared, and the results show that our approach is better than previous propositions to avoid locked situations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. In many scenarios, humans must team with agents to achieve joint aims. When working collectively in a team of human and artificial agents, communication is important to establish a shared situation of the task at hand. With no human in the loop and little cost for communication, information about the task can be easily exchanged. However, when communication becomes expensive, or when there are humans in the loop, the strategy for sharing information must be carefully designed: too little information leads to lack of shared situation awareness, while too much overloads the human team members, decreasing performance overall. This paper investigates the effects of sharing beliefs and goals in agent teams and in human-agent teams. We performed a set of experiments using the BlocksWorlds for Teams (BW4T) testbed to assess different strategies for information sharing. In previous experimental studies using BW4T, explanations about agent behaviour were shown to have no effect on team performance. One possible reason for this is because the existing scenarios in BW4T contained joint tasks, but not joint actions. That is, atomic actions that required interdependent and simultaneous action between more than one agent. We implemented new scenarios in BW4T in which some actions required two agents to complete. Our results showed an improvement in artificial-agent team performance when communicating goals and sharing beliefs, but with goals contributing more to team performance, and that in human-agent teams, communicating only goals was more effective than communicating both goals and beliefs.},

abstract = {Treating differentials as independent algebraic units have a long history of use and abuse. It is generally considered problematic to treat the derivative as a fraction of differentials rather than as a holistic unit acting as a limit, though for practical reasons it is often done for the first derivative. However, using a revised notation for the second and higher derivatives will allow for the ability to treat differentials as independent units for a much larger number of cases.},

abstract = {In species subject to individual and social learning, each individual is likely to express a certain number of different cultural traits acquired during its lifetime. If the process of trait innovation and transmission reaches a steady state in the population, the number of different cultural traits carried by an individual converges to some stationary distribution. We call this the trait-number distribution. In this paper, we derive the trait-number distributions for both individuals and populations when cultural traits are independent of each other. Our results suggest that as the number of cultural traits becomes large, the trait-number distributions approach Poisson distributions so that their means characterize cultural diversity in the population. We then analyse how the mean trait number varies at both the individual and population levels as a function of various demographic features, such as population size and subdivision, and social learning rules, such as conformism and anti-conformism. Diversity at the individual and population levels, as well as at the level of cultural homogeneity within groups, depends critically on the details of population demography and the individual and social learning rules.},

abstract = {As Internet resources are used more frequently for research on social and psychological behavior, concerns grow about whether characteristics of such research affect human subjects protections. Early efforts to address such concerns have done more to identify potential problems than to evaluate them or to seek solutions, leaving bodies charged with human subjects oversight in a quagmire. This article critiques some of these issues in light of the US Code of Federal Regulations' policies for the Protection of Human Subjects, and argues that some of the issues have no pertinence when examined in the context of common methodological approaches that previous commentators failed to consider. By separating applicable contexts from those that are not, and by identifying cases where subjects' characteristics are irrelevant and/or impossible to provide, oversight committees may be able to consider research applications more appropriately, and investigators may be less ethically bound to ascertain and demonstrate those characteristics.},

These seek to increase the effectiveness and democratic quality of policy making by involving citizens in policy. However, these have mainly operated at local levels of governance, and democratic theorists and practitioners have developed an ambition to scale these up in order to democratize higher tiers of government. This paper draws policy lessons from research on a “multi-level” process that held a similar ambition. The Sustainable Communities Act sought to integrate the results of various locally organized citizen deliberations within the policy development processes of central UK government. In doing so, it aimed to democratize central government problem definition and agenda-setting processes. The paper distinguishes between achievements and failures explained by process design, and more fundamental obstacles to do with broader contextual factors.

abstract = {Conversations between characters are important aspects of many videogames. However, most such conversational in-teractions in videogames are quite limited in how they take into account the identities of those characters. Conversa-tion in videogames typically varies, if at all, based only on one aspect of the character such as a non-player character (NPC) referring to the character by race, class, or a gendered pronoun. In this paper, we present an approach to devel-oping conversational narratives that addresses such limita-tions. Toward this end, we present the Chimeria platform, which uses a cognitive science-grounded model of social cat-egory membership to customize how conversational narra-tives unfold. We also present a playable interactive con-versational scenario called " Chimeria:Gatekeeper " authored using the Chimeria Platform. This scenario demonstrates how the system considers multiple aspects of a character's identity and degree of membership with, and between, social group categories in generating conversational dialog between a player character (PC) and an NPC. Using this scenario we illustrate how our approach allows the construction of con-versational narratives that convey social identity phenomena such as stigma and discrimination.},

Complex events are composed of interrelated events, and they can be defined at any level of spatio-temporal abstraction (equal to or above the lowest level of abstraction given by the model). Minimal types of complex events define sets, which are equated with particular emergent behaviours and can be detected in simulation. Since complex events are derived from the agent-based model itself, they provide significant benefits when compared with traditional state-aggregationmethods. First, they provide a method of specifying emergent behaviour, so that such behaviour can be monitored. Second, they provide a mechanism that retains the underlying structure of that behaviour. This latter property supports analysis of the mechanisms at lower levels that give rise to emergent behaviours, and identification of patterns between levels. In other words, multi-agent simulations become less 'opaque'[1].},

This paper shines a spotlight on this scholarship, and offers new ways to think about the dizzying array of simulation we encounter in our organizational, institutional, and everyday lives. I define simulation as an empirical social process and show how they vary in consequence by their experiential modality, their referential frame, and their perceived realism. I then document three conceptual trends in the literature: (i) treating simulation as an organizational technique for risk management; (ii) a focus on virtual reality, video games, and moral ambiguity; and (iii) studies of the impact of computer simulation on scientific knowledge production and the reorganization of some technical fields, such as weapons research, artificial intelligence, and meteorology. Organizational uncertainty tends to coalesce around disputes about the appropriate qualities and functions of a given simulation technique or technology. I conclude the paper by identifying how the sociology of simulation can connect with more established areas of contemporary research within organizations, work and occupations, and institutional sociology.},

The domain we focus on is characterized by real-time move-ment through a continuous space in which the player and opposing boss damage each other through phys-ical collisions, and player and boss behavior is gov-erned primarily by finite state machines. Our program-ming model consists of primitive systems such as kine-matic physics to store object state and detect collisions paired with finite state machines to define behavior. We describe our model and demonstrate its expressiveness with examples of three classic boss fights from games in The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, and Sonic the Hedge-hog. Our future goals include procedural generation of boss encounters, and we report on the research chal-lenges involved in achieving this goal.},

@article{Tennent1992,
abstract = {Denotational semantics is a methodology for giving mathematical meaning to programming languages and systems. It was developed by Christopher Strachey's Programming Research Group at Oxford University in the 1960s. The method combines mathematical rigor, due to the work of Dana Scott, with notational elegance, due to Strachey. Originally used as an analysis tool, denotational semantics has grown in use as a tool for language design and implementation. This book was written to make denotational semantics accessible to a wider audience and to update existing texts in the area. I have presented the topic from an engineering viewpoint, emphasizing the descriptional and implementational aspects. The relevant mathematics is also included, for it gives rigor and validity to the method and provides a foundation for further research. The book is intended as a tutorial for computing professionals and as a text for university courses at the upper undergraduate or beginning graduate level. The reader should be acquainted with discrete structures and one or more general purpose programming languages. Experience with an applicative-style language such as LISP, ML, or Scheme is also helpful.},

In this paper we introduce diagnosis techniques that actively guide stakeholders (knowledge engineers and domain experts) in the process of testing and debugging knowledge bases. These techniques take into account faulty test cases and constraints and recommend diagnoses which are the source of a given inconsistency.},

abstract = {In 1993 the Law Lords upheld the original conviction of five men under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act for participating in sado-masochistic practices. Although the five men were fully consenting adults, the Law Lords held that consent did not constitute a defence to acts of violence within a sado-masochistic context. This paper examines the judgements in this case and argues that sado-masochistic practices are no different from the known exceptions cited by the court to the idea that consent is no defence to violence (sport, parental chastisement and surgery). It also argues that if we can make sense of rape as a non-consensual, violent act, expressed through sex, then we can make sense of sado-masochism as a consensual sexual act, expressed through violence.},

Although relevant research exists across several disciplines including education and cognitive science, disciplinary differences have made this material inaccessible to many computing educators. Furthermore, computer science instructors have not had access to a comprehensive survey of research in this area. This paper collects and classifies this literature, identifies important work and mediates it to computing educators and professional bodies.  We identify research that gives well-supported advice to computing academics teaching introductory programming. Limitations and areas of incomplete coverage of existing research efforts are also identified. The analysis applies publication and research quality metrics developed by a previous ITiCSE working group [74]. },

Each chapter addresses architectures, from fully connected to partially connected, including recurrent multilayer feedforward. It presents problems involving trajectories, control systems, and robotics, as well as RNN use in chaotic systems. The authors also share their expert knowledge of ideas for alternate designs and advances in theoretical aspects. The dynamical behavior of recurrent neural networks is useful for solving problems in science, engineering, and business. This approach will yield huge advances in the coming years. Recurrent Neural Networks illuminates the opportunities and provides you with a broad view of the current events in this rich field.},

@article{Hodson2013,
abstract = {Weber's ideal typical model of bureaucracy constitutes the starting point for most scholarship on organizations. Much organizational behaviour, however occurs outside this formalized model. It is thus somewhat surprising that behaviours outside the formal-rational model are, more often than not, treated as aberrations. In contrast, the emerging critical literature on ‘inhabited institutions' has identified such gaps in our theoretical understanding as foundational, warranting a more agentic conception of organizational life—a conception more fully acknowledging of and sensitive to the dynamics of power in organizational life. In this regard, we highlight four prevalent (though seldom theoretically incorporated) features of contemporary bureaucracies—divergent goals, patrimonialism, unwritten rules and chaos. These features, which we contend are no less critical to organizational functioning than those identified by Weber, constitute an organizational logic more compatible with a Kafkan vision of bureaucracy than with a Weberian one. Theorizing such attributes allows us to explore elements of bureaucratic life that the formal-rational model of bureaucracy renders largely invisible and is conceptually and empirically ill equipped to incorporate. An illustrative analysis, drawing on narrative data drawn from the population of organizational ethnographies (n = 162) (1) demonstrates the prominence of such dynamics in organizational life; and (2) highlights their implications for rule breaking as a relatively common yet under-theorized occurrence. A core implication of our analysis and critique is that the social sciences need a fundamentally revised theory of bureaucracy capable of understanding bureaucracy's power laden and often dystrophic features.},

There has been an emerging consensus on theAI approach, in particular the use of planning systems. However, thesehave concentrated on the generation of a sequence of narrative actions,staged through the behaviour of virtual actors. In order to achieve thelong-term objective of implementing interactive media that wouldreproduce the aesthetic qualities of traditional films, mostinteractive storytelling systems are still missing the ability togenerate dialogues between characters. We describe an extension of ourInteractive Storytelling approach which integrates dialogue generationwithin narrative situations. Our unit of generation is the dialogue act(pair of utterances) and one main objective is to reproduce realisticdialogue phenomena based on implicit forms of expression. The emphasisis also on adopting a unified approach relating narrativerepresentations to the linguistic form of the generated utterances.From a representation of active narrative goals and the emotionalaffinity between characters, our system is able to derive a set ofparameters governing various aspects of the linguistic form to begenerated. We illustrate this approach on several implemented examples.},

abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between the perceived eeriness of a virtual character with the perception of human-likeness for some attributes of motion and sound. 100 participants were asked to rate 13 video clips of 12 different virtual characters and one human. The results indicate that attributes of motion and sound do exaggerate the uncanny phenomenon and how frightening that character is perceived to be. Strong correlations were identified for the perceived eeriness for a character with how human-like a character‘s voice sounded, how human-like facial expression appeared and the synchronization of the character‘s sound with lip movement; characters rated as the least synchronized were perceived to be the most frightening. Based on the results of this study, this paper seeks to define an initial set of hypotheses for the fear- evoking aspects of character facial rendering and vocalization in survival horror games that can be used by game designers seeking to increase the fear factor in the genre and that will form the basis of further experiments which, it is hoped, will lead to a conceptual framework for the uncanny.},

abstract = {We describe an implementation integrating a complete spoken dialogue system with a mobile robot, which a human can direct to specific locations, ask for information about its status and supply information about its environment. The robot uses an internal map for navigation, and communicates its current orientation and accessible locations to the dialogue system using a topological map as interface. We focus on linguistic and inferential aspects of the human{\^{a}}€“robot communication process. The result is a novel approach using a principled semantic theory combined with techniques from automated deduction applied to a mobile robot platform. Due to the abstract level of the dialogue system, it is easily portable to other environments or applications.

@article{Newman2018,
abstract = {We propose a tensor neural network ({\$}t{\$}-NN) framework that offers an exciting new paradigm for designing neural networks with multidimensional (tensor) data. Our network architecture is based on the {\$}t{\$}-product (Kilmer and Martin, 2011), an algebraic formulation to multiply tensors via circulant convolution. In this {\$}t{\$}-product algebra, we interpret tensors as {\$}t{\$}-linear operators analogous to matrices as linear operators, and hence our framework inherits mimetic matrix properties. To exemplify the elegant, matrix-mimetic algebraic structure of our {\$}t{\$}-NNs, we expand on recent work (Haber and Ruthotto, 2017) which interprets deep neural networks as discretizations of non-linear differential equations and introduces stable neural networks which promote superior generalization. Motivated by this dynamic framework, we introduce a stable {\$}t{\$}-NN which facilitates more rapid learning because of its reduced, more powerful parameterization. Through our high-dimensional design, we create a more compact parameter space and extract multidimensional correlations otherwise latent in traditional algorithms. We further generalize our {\$}t{\$}-NN framework to a family of tensor-tensor products (Kernfeld, Kilmer, and Aeron, 2015) which still induce a matrix-mimetic algebraic structure. Through numerical experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate the more powerful parameterizations and improved generalizability of stable {\$}t{\$}-NNs.},

abstract = {This study was designed to validate an in vivo measurement of the functional sensitivity of basal ganglia neuronal circuits containing dopamine D2 receptors. We hypothesized that a D2 agonist would decrease striatopallidal neuronal activity, and hence regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) over the axon terminals in the globus pallidus. Quantitative pallidal blood flow was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with bolus injections of H215O and arterial sampling in six baboons before and after intravenous administration of the selective D2 agonist U91356a. We also tested whether the response to U91356a was modified by previous acute administration of various antagonists. Another baboon had serial measurements of blood flow under identical conditions, but received no dopaminergic drugs. In all animals that received U91356a, pallidal flow decreased in a dose-related manner. Global CBF had a similar response, but the decline in pallidal flow was greater in magnitude and remained significant after accounting for the global effect. A D2 antagonist, but not antagonists of D1, serotonin-2, or peripheral D2 receptors, prevented this decrease. This work demonstrates and validates an in vivo measure of the sensitivity of D2-mediated basal ganglia pathways. It also supports the hypothesis that activation of the indirect striatopallidal pathway, previously demonstrated using nonselective D2-like agonists, can be mediated specifically by D2 receptors. We speculate that the U91356a-PET technique may prove useful in detecting functional abnormalities of D2-mediated dopaminergic function in diseases such as parkinsonism, dystonia, Tourette syndrome, or schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Now that the study of consciousness is warmly embraced by cognitive scientists, much confusion seems to arise between the concepts of visual attention and visual awareness. Often, visual awareness is equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however, two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

In this paper we provide a review of 14 agent decision making architectures that have attracted interest. They range from production-rule systems to psychologically- and neurologically-inspired approaches. For each of the architectures we give an overview of its design, highlight research questions that have been answered with its help and outline the reasons for the choice of the decision making model provided by the originators. Our goal is to provide guidelines about what kind of agent decision making model, with which level of simplicity or complexity, to use for which kind of research question.},

It is based on an extension of Term Rewriting Systems (TRS) in which the terms are replaced by graphs. Such a Graph Rewriting System (GRS) consists of a, possibly cyclic, directed graph, called the data graph and graph rewrite rules which specify how this data graph may be rewritten. Clean is designed to provide a firm base for functional programming. In particular, Clean is suitable as an intermediate language between functional languages and (parallel) target machine architectures. A sequential implementation of Clean on a conventional machine is described and its performance is compared with other systems. The results show that Clean can be efficiently implemented.},

abstract = {The prevalence of several human morbid phenotypes is sometimes much higher than intuitively expected. This can directly arise from the presence of two sexes, male and female, in one species. Men and women have almost identical genomes but are distinctly dimorphic, with dissimilar disease susceptibilities. Sexually dimorphic traits mainly result from differential expression of genes present in both sexes. Such genes can be subject to different, and even opposing, selection constraints in the two sexes. This can impact human evolution by differential selection on mutations with dissimilar effects on the two sexes. We comprehensively mapped human sex-differential genetic architecture across 53 tissues. Analyzing available RNA-sequencing data from 544 adults revealed thousands of genes differentially expressed in the reproductive tracts and tissues common to both sexes. Sex-differential genes are related to various biological systems, and suggest new insights into the pathophysiology of diverse human diseases. We also identified a significant association between sex-specific gene transcription and reduced selection efficiency and accumulation of deleterious mutations, which might affect the prevalence of different traits and diseases. Interestingly, many of the sex-specific genes that also undergo reduced selection efficiency are essential for successful reproduction in men or women. This seeming paradox might partially explain the high incidence of human infertility. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the sex-differential transcriptome and its importance to human evolution and human physiology in health and in disease.},

Social scientists have offered several accounts to explain financial markets' ascen-dance, but this work often portrays financialization as a totalizing force and is conducted within divergent theoretical paradigms—political economy and neo-institutionalism— with few attempts to bridge these differences. Accordingly, we risk talking past each other while failing to identify where financialization occurs. I address these issues with a unique panel data set, panel analysis and with a focus on identifying the meso-level determinants of financialization. I do so with a substantively important industry that exemplifies the global, flexible and competitive characteristics of neo-liberal capitalism. I argue that the propensity to financialize rests significantly upon firms' productive roles, meaning we cannot understand financialization without under-standing production—global production networks in particular. This is also a call for researchers to explore financialization's multifaceted character and to develop a more analytically rigorous research agenda.},

abstract = {Much of cognitive research on deductive reasoning has been preoccupied with advocating for or against visuospatial (mental model theory) or linguistic/syntactic (mental logic theory) models of logical reasoning. Neuroimaging studies bear on this issue by pointing to both language-based and visuospatial systems being engaged during logical reasoning, and by raising additional issues not anticipated by these cognitive theories. Here, the literature on the neural basis of deductive reasoning from the past decade is reviewed. Although these results might seem chaotic and inconsistent, we identify several interesting patterns and articulate their implications for cognitive theories of reasoning. Cognitive neuroscience data point away from a unitary system for logical reasoning and towards a fractionated system dynamically reconfigured in response to specific task and environmental cues.},

abstract = {Can computer games be great literature? Do the rapidly evolving and culturally expanding genres of digital literature mean that the narrative mode of discourse - novels, films, television series - is losing its dominant position in our culture? Is it necessary to define a new aesthetics of cyborg textuality? In Cybertext, Espen Aarseth explores the aesthetics and textual dynamics of digital literature and its diverse genres, including hypertext fiction, computer games, computer-generated poetry and prose, and collaborative Internet texts such as MUDs. Instead of insisting on the uniqueness and newness of electronic writing and interactive fiction, however, Aarseth situates these literary forms within the tradition of "ergodic" literature-a term borrowed from physics to describe open, dynamic texts such as the I Ching or Apollinaire's calligrams, with which the reader must perform specific actions to generate a literary sequence.Constructing a theoretical model that describes how new electronic forms build on this tradition, Aarseth bridges the widely assumed divide between paper texts and electronic texts. He then uses the perspective of ergodic aesthetics to reexamine literary theories of narrative, semiotics, and rhetoric and to explore the implications of applying these theories to materials for which they were not intended."In many respects, this is the book I and many others have been waiting for. I have not seen any work so comprehensive in its synthesis of previous commentary. Aarseth's brilliant observations remind me of McLuhan's 'probes'-highly condensed, provocative statements meant to generate controversy and insight. This is clearly the best study of electronic texts I have yet read."-Stuart Moulthrop, University of Baltimore, author of Victory Garden},

@article{Program1992a,
abstract = {Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987), argues that in most coherent discourse, consecutive discourse elements are related by a small set of rhetor- ical relations. Moreover, RST suggests that the information conveyed in a discourse over and above what is conveyed in its component clauses can be derived from the rhetorical relation-based structure of the discourse. A large number of natural lan- guage generation systems rely on the rhetorical relations defined in RST to impose structure on multi-sentential text (Hovy 1991; Knott 1991; Moore and Paris 1989; Ros- ner and Stede 1992). In addition, many descriptive studies of discourse have employed RST (Fox 1987; Linden, Cumming, and Martin 1992; Matthiessen and Thompson 1988). However, recent work by Moore and Paris (1992) noted that RST cannot be used as the sole means of controlling discourse structure in an interactive dialogue system, be- cause RST representations provide insufficient information to support the generation of appropriate responses to "follow-up questions." The basic problem is that an RST representation of a discourse does not fully specify the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986) of that discourse. Intentional structure is crucial for responding effectively to questions that address a previous utterance: without a record of what an utterance was intended to achieve, it is impossible to elaborate or clarify that utterance. 1},

abstract = {Often, video game designers must choose between creating a restrictive, linear experience and designing an open world with many different story lines that fail to form a tightly crafted narra- tive arc. A drama manager (DM) can provide a solution to this dilemma. A DM monitors an interactive experience, such as a computer game, and intervenes to shape the global experience so that it satisfies the authors expressive goals without decreasing a players interactive agency. Previous work with declarative op- timization-based drama management (DODM) has focused on simulated player studies in abstract game worlds. In this paper, we present the integration of DODM into a real-time adventure- style dungeon game called EMPath. We describe the game world as well as the modifications that had to be made to the DM as the result of integrating with a concrete, playable experience. These changes include the development of new story evaluation fea- tures, improving drama management move refiners and creating a new player model. We also describe the results of a play test comparing player experiences with the drama manager on and off. Introduction},

Bodley explicitly seeks a balance between ecological-materialist and cultural-ideological explanations of sociocultural systems, while stressing the importance of individual power-seeking and human agency. Part One examines domestic-scale, autonomous tribal cultures. Part Two presents politically organized, class-based civilizations and ancient empires in the imperial world. Part Three surveys global, industrial, market-based civilizations in the contemporary commercial world. Cultural Anthropology uniquely challenges students to consider the big questions about the nature of cultural systems.},

This class includes M and S4 as well as S5; we will also treat a new system, the BROUWER-sche system. In sequels to the present paper, we intend to extend the treatment to non-normal modal propositional calculi (see 7 for an enumeration of the systems included), and to quantificational and identity extensions of all these propositional systems of modal logic (see again 7 for details; but readers of I will have an inkling of how quantificational extensions are to be carried out). Thorough acqua- intance with I is presupposed; and many of the proofs in this paper (which, by reason of the many systems here treated, is occasionally somewhat compressed), are better comprehended by a comparison with the corresponding proofs in l.},

@book{Lefebvre1984,
abstract = {Henri Lefebvre has considerable claims to be the greatest living philosopher. His work spans some sixty years and includes original work on a diverse range of subjects, from dialectical materialism to architecture, urbanism and the experience of everyday life. The Production of Space is his major philosophical work and its translation has been long awaited by scholars in many different fields. The book is a search for a reconciliation between mental space (the space of the philosophers) and real space (the physical and social spheres in which we all live). In the course of his exploration, Henri Lefebvre moves from metaphysical and ideological considerations of the meaning of space to its experience in the everyday life of home and city. He seeks, in other words, to bridge the gap between the realms of theory and practice, between the mental and the social, and between philosophy and reality. In doing so, he ranges through art, literature, architecture and economics, and further provides a powerful antidote to the sterile and obfuscatory methods and theories characteristic of much recent continental philosophy. This is a work of great vision and incisiveness. It is also characterized by its author's wit and by anecdote, as well as by a deftness of style which Donald Nicholson-Smith's sensitive translation precisely captures.},

Qualitative findings construct a semiotic triangle in which: (i) Child rape and wealth reflect upon witchcraft by highlighting its accumulative rather than distributive nature; (ii) Child rape and witchcraft cast aspersions on power, including liberal governance and (iii) Rape is a metaphysical theft of power, a perspective that converges with some feminist analyses. Understanding this discourse can lead to better research on sexual violence in conflict-affected countries.},

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},

This logic for strategic reasoning has group strategies as first class citizens, and brings game logic closer to standard modal logic. We demonstrate that MASL can express key notions of game theory, social choice theory and voting theory in a natural way, we give a sound and complete proof system for MASL, and we show that MASL encodes coalition logic. Next, we extend the language to epistemic multi-agent strategic logic (EMASL), we give examples of what it can express, we propose to use it for posing new questions in epistemic social choice theory, and we give a cal-culus for reasoning about a natural class of epistemic game models. We end by listing avenues for future research and by tracing connections to a number of other logics for reasoning about strategies.},

Relying on a new method for conceptualizing forms and modes of participation we show that a large variety of creative, expressive, individualized, and digitally enabled forms of participation can be classified as parts of the repertoire of political participation. Results from an innovative survey with a representative sample of the German population demonstrate that old and new forms are systematically integrated into a multi-dimensional taxonomy covering (1) voting, (2) digitally networked participation, (3) institutionalized participation, (4) protest, (5) civic participation, and (6) consumerist participation. Furthermore, the antecedents of consumerist, civic, and digitally networked participation, are very similar to those of older modes of participation such as protest and institutionalized participation. Whereas creative, expressive, and individualized modes appear to be expansions of protest activities, digitally networked forms clearly establish a new and distinct mode of political participation that fits in the general repertoire of political participation.},

abstract = {This paper describes the METACOMPOSE music generator, a compositional, extensible framework for affective music composition. In this context 'affective' refers to the music generator's ability to express emotional information. The main purpose of METACOMPOSE is to create music in real-time that can express different mood-states, which we achieve through a unique combination of a graph traversal-based chord sequence generator, a search-based melody generator, a pattern-based accompaniment generator, and a theory for mood expression. Melody generation uses a novel evolutionary technique combining FI-2POP with multi-objective optimization. This allows us to explore a Pareto front of diverse solutions that are creatively equivalent under the terms of a multi-criteria objective function. Two quantitative user studies were performed to evaluate the system: one focusing on the music generation technique, and the other that explores valence expression, via the introduction of dissonances. The results of these studies demonstrate (i) that each part of the generation system improves the perceived quality of the music produced, and (ii) how valence expression via dissonance produces the perceived affective state. This system, which can reliably generate affect-expressive music, can sub-sequently be integrated in any kind of interactive application (e.g., games) to create an adaptive and dynamic soundtrack.},

In this article, I offer an argument to this effect, explicating preservation of freedom of choice in terms of choice-set preservation and noncontrol.

abstract = {This paper considers possible futures for human space settlements through the life story and experiences of David Vetter—a child born with severe combined immunodeﬁciency who became known in popular media as the “bubble boy.” Lynn Margulis imagined the creation of ecosystems and human settlements on another planet could be an act of Gaia reproducing by budding, through ecopoiesis. Thinking with Margulis about humans as holobionts, our species is both constituted by and embedded within communities of organisms and ecologies. As holobionts we may not be able to live outside of these communities and systems or away from Earth, even if we can temporarily survive without them. Placed within an evolutionary framework, techno-capitalist imaginaries of space settlement limit conceptions of planetary reproduction to heteronormative models of ecopoiesis which promote competition as a key driver of evolution instead of cooperation. Technologically mediated survival along with forced reproduction of holobionts within Earth-like systems and could lead to suffering and isolation like David Vetter's forced survival in a bubble. I propose alternative liberatory modes of conceptualizing and materializing space migration (including queer and decolonized forms of reproduction) which better respect the Earth, its inhabitants, as well as extraterrestrial planets, landscapes, lives, and possibilities.},

abstract = {One of the popular albeit controversial ideas in the last century of moral philosophy is that what we ought to do is explained by our reasons. And one of the central features of reasons that accounts for their popularity among normative theorists is that they can conflict. But I argue that the fact that reasons conflict actually also poses two closely related problems for this popular idea in moral philosophy. The first problem is a generalization of a problem in deontic logic concerning the existence of conflicting obligations. The second problem arises from a tension between the fact that reasons can conflict and a model of how reasons explain `ought's that has been widely accepted. Having presented each of these problems, I develop a unified solution to them that is informed by results in both ethics and deontic logic. An important implication of this solution is that we must distinguish between derivative and nonderivative reasons and revise our conception how it is that reasons explain `ought's .},

abstract = {High-profile incidents of police misconduct have led to widespread calls for law enforcement reform. But prior studies cast doubt on whether police commanders can control officers, and offer few policy remedies because of their focus on potentially immutable officer traits like personality. I advance an alternative, institutional perspective and demonstrate that police officers-sometimes characterized as autonomous-are highly responsive to managerial directives. Using millions of records of police-citizen interactions alongside officer interviews, I evaluate the impact of a change to the protocol for stopping criminal suspects on police performance. An interrupted time series analysis shows the directive produced an immediate increase in the rate of stops producing evidence of the suspected crime. Interviewed officers said the order signaled increased managerial scrutiny, leading them to adopt more conservative tactics. Procedural changes can quickly and dramatically alter officer behavior, suggesting a reform strategy sometimes forestalled by psychological and personality-driven accounts of police reform.},

abstract = {Choice poetics is a formalist framework that seeks to concretely describe the impacts choices have on player experiences within narrative games. Developed in part to support algorithmic generation of narrative choices, the theory includes a detailed analytical framework for understanding the impressions choice structures make by analyzing the relationships among options, outcomes, and player goals. The theory also emphasizes the need to account for players' various modes of engagement, which vary both during play and between players. In this work, we illustrate the non-computational application of choice poetics to the analysis of two different games to further develop the theory and make it more accessible to others. We focus first on using choice poetics to examine the central repeated choice in “Undertale,” and show how it can be used to contrast two different player types that will approach a choice differently. Finally, we give an example of fine-grained analysis using a choice from the game “Papers, Please,” which breaks down options and their outcomes to illustrate exactly how the choice pushes players towards complicity via the introduction of uncertainty. Through all of these examples, we hope to show the usefulness of choice poetics as a framework for understanding narrative choices, and to demonstrate concretely how one could productively apply it to choices “in the wild.”},

Some forms, such as games, have been argued to be more successful at balancing the tension between interactivity and immersion than forms like hypertext fiction [16]. Using these two forms as illustration, this paper will argue for the need for more nuanced understandings of “agency” and “immersion” by introducing definitions of diegetic and extra-diegetic agency alongside definitions of narrative and mechanical immersion. Extending the vocabulary of agency and immersion highlights some key differences in how games and hypertexts have been understood.},

abstract = {The semantic field associated with the term 'classification', three main intellectual and/or practical operations, and three different products, can be identified — there being no one-to-one correspondence between operations and products. Through intensional classification, the extension of a concept at a given level of generality is subdivided into two or more narrower extensions corresponding to as many concepts at lower level of generality; this subdivision is obtained by stating that an aspect of the intension of each of the latter concepts is a different partial articulation of the corresponding aspect of the intension of the higher concept. Through extensional classification, the objects or events of a given set are grouped into two or more subsets according to the perceived similarities of their states on one or (more frequently) several properties; subsets may be successively grouped into subsets of wider extension and higher hierarchical level. Through classing, objects or events are assigned to classes or types which have been previously defined, usually by an intensional classification, but possibly by an extensional one operating on a different set. When only one fundamentum divisionis is considered, a classification scheme is produced — usually by an intensional classification. The extensions of each class must be mutually exclusive, and jointly exhaustive. Classes need not be at the same level of generality, and may be ordered. When several fundamenta are jointly considered, a typology is produced. This may be done through either intensional or extensional classification. The underlying category space may be " reduced " or reconstructed through " substruction " . When several fundamenta are considered in succession through a series of intensional classifications, a taxonomy is produced. Specific concepts/terms (such as taxon, rank, clade) are needed to deal with taxonomies. In the final chapter it is argued that the role of classification has been improperly assessed by several different quarters: in particular by those who credit it with ontological capacities and tasks; by those who see classificatory procedures as an old-fashioned activity to be abandoned in favour of more " scientific " measurement; and by those who blame the retarded development of an " explanatory " social science on the undue attention paid to classification by many of the founding fathers of sociology and cognate disciplines.},

abstract = {The usual presentations of deontic logic, whether axiomatic or semantic, treat norms as if they could bear truth-values. A fundamental problem of deontic logic, we believe, is to reconstruct it in accord with the philosophical position that norms direct rather than describe, and are neither true nor false.$\backslash$n(Alchourr{\{}{\'{o}}{\}}n and Bulygin 1981) have indeed made such a construction, refining an earlier one of (Stenius 1963), based on the distinction between a norm and a proposition about norms. However it has the limitation that it does not deal with conditional norms. These are covered by an extension of (Alchourr{\{}{\'{o}}{\}}n 1993), but with certain shortcomings. Our purpose is to extend the basic 1981 construction in another manner which, we suggest, provides a more satisfactory and sensitive analysis of conditional norms within the same philosophical perspective.$\backslash$nThe approach takes seriously the warning: no logic of norms without attention to a system of which they form part. It is based on the notion of the iterative development of output of an explicitly presented normative code, under a given condition. It is neither axiomatic in style nor formulated in terms of a semantics of "possible worlds". It develops output by repeated detachment rather than by consequence (so as not to lose the directionality of conditional norms), and it distinguishes between gross and net output (so as to deal adequately with conditions that are "contrary-to-duty").$\backslash$nThe investigation also provides new perspectives on some well known problems. In particular, it throws light on the way in which explicit obligations may have a part in generating permissions, and how explicit permissions may limit obligations. It also helps pin down a distinction between "substantive" and "technical" defeasibility of conditional norms.},

However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements? We analyze data from the 2016 Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to assess whether all Black lives matter to Black Americans.},

We investigate whether the decline in global atmospheric CO2 concentration by 7–10 ppm in the late 1500s and early 1600s which globally lowered surface air temperatures by 0.15∘C, were generated by natural forcing or were a result of the large-scale depopulation of the Americas after European arrival, subsequent land use change and secondary succession. We quantitatively review the evidence for (i) the pre-Columbian population size, (ii) their per capita land use, (iii) the post-1492 population loss, (iv) the resulting carbon uptake of the abandoned anthropogenic landscapes, and then compare these to potential natural drivers of global carbon declines of 7–10 ppm. From 119 published regional population estimates we calculate a pre-1492 CE population of 60.5 million (interquartile range, IQR 44.8–78.2 million), utilizing 1.04 ha land per capita (IQR 0.98–1.11). European epidemics removed 90{\%} (IQR 87–92{\%}) of the indigenous population over the next century. This resulted in secondary succession of 55.8 Mha (IQR 39.0–78.4 Mha) of abandoned land, sequestering 7.4 Pg C (IQR 4.9–10.8 Pg C), equivalent to a decline in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm (IQR 2.3–5.1 ppm CO2). Accounting for carbon cycle feedbacks plus LUC outside the Americas gives a total 5 ppm CO2 additional uptake into the land surface in the 1500s compared to the 1400s, 47–67{\%} of the atmospheric CO2 decline. Furthermore, we show that the global carbon budget of the 1500s cannot be balanced until large-scale vegetation regeneration in the Americas is included. The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth System in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

abstract = {Without good models and the right tools to interpret them, data scientists risk making decisions based on hidden biases, spurious correlations, and false generalizations. This has led to a rallying cry for model interpretability. Yet the concept of interpretability remains nebulous, such that researchers and tool designers lack actionable guidelines for how to incorporate interpretability into models and accompanying tools. Through an iterative design process with expert machine learning researchers and practitioners, we designed a visual analytics system, Gamut, to explore how interactive interfaces could better support model interpretation. Using Gamut as a probe, we investigated why and how professional data scientists interpret models, and how interface af-fordances can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability. Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept: data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences, often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness. Participants also asked to use Gamut in their work, highlighting its potential to help data scientists understand their own data. CCS CONCEPTS • Human-centered computing → Empirical studies in visualization; Visualization systems and tools; • Computing methodologies → Machine learning. 1 INTRODUCTION With recent advances in machine learning (ML) [29, 37, 58, 65], people are beginning to use ML to address important societal problems like identifying and predicting cancerous cells [14, 32], predicting poverty from satellite imagery to inform policy decisions [27], and locating buildings that are susceptible to catching on fire [43, 59]. Unfortunately, the metrics by which models are trained and evaluated often hide biases, spurious correlations, and false generalizations inside complex, internal structure. These pitfalls are nuanced, particularly to novices, and cannot be diagnosed with simple quality metrics, like a single accuracy number [66]. This is troublesome when ML is misused, with intent or ignorance , in situations where ethics and fairness are paramount. Lacking an explanation for how models perform can lead to biased and ill-informed decisions, like representing gender bias in facial analysis systems [7], propagating historical cultural stereotypes in text corpora into widely used AI components [8], and biasing recidivism predictions by race [3]. This is the problem of model interpretability.},

In their recent book, Nudge, 1 Richard Thaler and then Obama advisor (now head of the White House's Ofﬁce of Information and Regulatory Affairs), Cass Sunstein, suggest several ways in which government agencies and private organizations might “nudge” individuals toward actions that are better for them.2 They hope to promote libertarian paternalism as “a promising foundation for bipartisanship—a way of maintaining our ﬁrm commitment to freedom of choice while also helping people make better decisions for themselves” (p. 14). They suggest “that libertarian paternalism offers a real Third Way—one that can break through some of the least tractable debates in contemporary democracies” (p. 252/255).},

abstract = {Traditionally, the most commonly used source of bibliometric data is Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge, in particular the Web of Science and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which provide the yearly Journal Impact Factors (JIF). This paper presents an alternative source of data (Google Scholar, GS) as well as 3 alternatives to the JIF to assess journal impact (h-index, g-index and the number of citations per paper). Because of its broader range of data sources, the use of GS gen- erally results in more comprehensive citation coverage in the area of management and international business. The use of GS particularly benefits academics publishing in sources that are not (well) cov- ered in ISI. Among these are books, conference papers, non-US journals, and in general journals in the field of strategy and international business. The 3 alternative GS-based metrics showed strong correlations with the traditional JIF. As such, they provide academics and universities committed to JIFs with a good alternative for journals that are not ISI-indexed. However, we argue that these metrics provide additional advantages over the JIF and that the free availability of GS allows for a democratization of citation analysis as it provides every academic access to citation data regardless of their institution's financial means.},

We introduce two novel features in the language of propositional dynamic logic, converse as backwards modality and abstract processes specified by preconditions and effects, written as $\phi$ ⇒ $\psi$ and first explored in our recent paper (Hartonas, Log J IGPL Oxf Univ Press, 2012), where a Gentzen-style sequent calculus was introduced. The system has two very natural interpretations, one based on the familiar relational semantics and the other based on type semantics, where action terms are interpreted as types of actions (sets of binary relations). We show that the proof systems do not distinguish between the two kinds of semantics, by completeness arguments. Converse as backwards modality together with action types allow us to produce a new purely equational axiomatization of Dynamic Algebras, where iteration is axiomatized independently of box and where the fixpoint and Segerberg induction axioms are derivable. The system also includes capabilities operators and our results provide then a finitary Hilbert-style axiomatization and a decidable system for reasoning about agent capabilities, missing in the KARO framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

For that reason, they maintain, authorities who knowwhat is best for us need to step in and steer our behavior with the help of Bnudges.{\^{}} Nudges are nothing new, but justifying them on the basis of a latent irrationality is. In this article, I analyze the scientific evidence presented for such a justification. It suffers from narrow logical norms, that is, a misunderstanding of the nature of rational thinking, and from a confirmation bias,that is, selective reporting of research. These two flaws focus the blame on individuals' minds rather than on external causes, such as industries that spend billions to nudge people into unhealthy behavior. I conclude that the claim that we are hardly educable lacks evidence and forecloses the true alternative to nudging: teaching people to become risk savvy.},

@article{Ganguly2019,
abstract = {Exposure to early life adversity can predispose adolescents to the formation of substance abuse disorders. In rodents, early stressors such as repeated maternal separation (MS) impact AMPAR activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), regions involved in drug-cue association after cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Notably, previous reports suggest that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) regulates AMPAR subunit composition; increased TNF levels are reported to reduce GluA2-positive AMPARs. Since MS can elevate adolescent TNF levels, the stressor may therefore alter AMPAR subunit composition via neuroimmune signaling, thereby affecting cocaine-induced CPP. We tested the specific role of soluble TNF in MS-induced GluA2 loss and cocaine-induced CPP with biologic disruption of TNF signaling. TNF gene and protein expression were elevated in both PFC and NAc of MS males, but not females. GluA2 expression was reduced in both regions in only male MS rats, and systemic treatment with either ibudilast – a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, or XPro1595 – a blood-brain barrier-permeable blocker of soluble TNF – reversed such loss. MS males also formed greater preference for a cocaine-paired environment, the expression of which returned to control levels after XPro1595 administration. These data suggest a sex-specific mechanistic link between TNF signaling and changes in GluA2 expression and drug-cue conditioning, thereby providing further evidence for a role of MS and neuro-immune activity in cortical and striatal AMPAR changes. Moreover, manipulation of the TNF signaling pathway represents a novel approach for influencing response to reinforcing effects of drug use.},

abstract = {Many theories of human debugging rely on complex mental constructs that offer little practical advice to builders of software engineering tools. Although hypotheses are important in debugging, a theory of navigation adds more practical value to our understanding of how programmers debug. Therefore, in this paper, we reconsider how people go about debugging in large collections of source code using a modern programming environment. We present an information foraging theory of debugging that treats programmer navigation during debugging as being analogous to a predator following scent to find prey in the wild. The theory proposes that constructs of scent and topology provide enough information to describe and predict programmer navigation during debugging, without reference to mental states such as hypotheses. We investigate the scope of our theory through an empirical study of 10 professional programmers debugging a real-world open source program. We found that the programmers' verbalizations far more often concerned scent-following than hypotheses. To evaluate the predictiveness of our theory, we created an executable model that predicted programmer navigation behavior more accurately than comparable models that did not consider information scent. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for enhancing software engineering tools.},

We estimate that the current Bitcoin scheme generates a large welfare loss of 1.4{\%} of consumption. This welfare loss can be lowered substantially to 0.08{\%} by adopting an optimal design that reduces mining and relies exclusively on money growth rather than transaction fees to finance mining rewards. We also point out that cryptocurrencies can potentially challenge retail payment systems provided scaling limitations can be addressed.},

abstract = {A long-held belief among mental health practitioners is that being born unwanted carries a risk of negative psychosocial development and poor mental health in adulthood. The Prague Study was designed to test this hypothesis. It followed the development and mental well-being of 220 children (now adults) born in 1961-63 in Prague to women twice denied abortion for the same unwanted pregnancy. The children were individually pair-matched at about age nine with 220 children born from accepted pregnancies when no abortion had been requested. This article brings together in one place the theoretical assumptions and hypotheses, the criteria for selecting the study participants and major findings from five follow-up waves conducted among the children around the ages of 9, 14-16, 21-23, 28-31 and 32-35 years, plus a sub-study of married unwanted pregnancy subjects and accepted pregnancy controls at ages 26-28. To control for potential confounding factors in data interpretation, all siblings of all subjects were included in the last two waves. It was found that differences in psychosocial development widened over time but lessened at around age 30. All the differences consistently disfavoured the unwanted pregnancy subjects, especially only children (no siblings). They became psychiatric patients (especially in-patients) more frequently than the accepted pregnancy controls and also more often than their siblings. The overall findings suggest that, in the aggregate, denial of abortion for unwanted pregnancy entails an increased risk for negative psychosocial development and mental well-being in adulthood. {\textcopyright} 2006 Reproductive Health Matters.},

For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let's be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Mason doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is--a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited--"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.},

abstract = {Advances in AI techniques and computing platforms have triggered a lively and expanding discourse on ethical decision-making by autonomous agents. Much recent work in AI concentrates on the challenges of moral decision making from a decision-theoretic perspective, and especially the representation of various ethical dilemmas. Such approaches may be useful but in general are not productive because moral decision making is as context-driven as other forms of decision making, if not more. In contrast, we consider ethics not from the standpoint of an individual agent but of the wider sociotechnical systems (STS) in which the agent operates. Our contribution in this paper is the conception of ethical STS founded on governance that takes into account stakeholder values, normative constraints on agents, and outcomes (states of the STS) that obtain due to actions taken by agents. An important element of our conception is accountability, which is necessary for adequate consideration of outcomes that prima facie appear ethical or unethical. Focusing on STSs avoids the difficult problems of ethics as the norms of the STS give an operational basis for agent decision making.},

Through critical discourse analysis, I argue that the BZP does reflect a neoliberalization of public health, but as an "actually existing neoliberalism" it emerges from a specific policy context, including dramatic health sector policy changes due to the national Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare; a media discourse of health crisis for an aging Midwestern population; and an effort to refashion Iowa cities as sites of healthy and active living, to retain and attract a creative class of young entrepreneurs. The BZP employs many well-known mechanisms of neoliberal governance: the public-private partnership; competition among communities for "public" funds; promotion of an apolitical discourse on individual responsibility and ownership of health; decentralizing governance to the "community" level; and marketing, branding, and corporate sponsorship of public projects. The BZP exemplifies the process of "neoliberal governmentality," by which individuals learn to govern themselves and their "life projects" in line with a market-based rationality. However, with its emphasis on "nudging" individuals towards healthy behaviors through small changes in the local environment, the BZP reflects the rise of "libertarian paternalism," a variant of neoliberalism, as a dominant ideology underlying contemporary health promotion efforts.},

The adaptation analysis develops (a) information patch models, which deal with time allocation and information filtering and enrichment activities in environments in which information is encountered in clusters; (b) information scent models, which address the identification of information value from proximal cues; and (c) information diet models, which address decisions about the selection and pursuit of information items.

This debate largely sidesteps two questions that are central to understanding the future of international order: how strong is the current Western hegemonic order and what is the likelihood that China can or will lead a successful counterhegemonic challenge? We argue that the future of international order is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution of identity across the great powers. We develop a constructivist account of hegemonic transition and stability that theorizes the role of the distribution of identity in international order. In our account, hegemonic orders depend on a legitimating ideology that must be consistent with the distribution of identity at the level of both elites and masses. We map the distribution of identity across nine great powers and assess how this distribution supports the current Western neoliberal democratic hegemony. We conclude that China is unlikely to become the hegemon in the near term.},

abstract = {The 3.11 compounded disaster in Tohoku, Japan served as catalyst for some nations, including Germany, Belgium, and Italy, to alter nuclear policies but had no impact on the approaches of a number of others such as Vietnam, China, and Russia.  Our article investigates why, despite facing the same focusing event, private- and state-owned utilities in some countries altered their nuclear energy policies while others kept the status quo.  We use a mixed-methods approach to understand this variation in energy policy outcomes.  Our quantitative analysis of 84 countries based on a new, sui generis dataset shows that Green Party vote share and strong voice/accountability are negatively correlated with changes in nuclear power programs while media openness and political stability are positively connected with atomic energy decisions.  Using in-depth case studies of Germany and Japan we further explore the role of domestic political institutions and country-specific norms to show more precisely how actors interacted with ideas to influence energy decisions.  This article brings implications for the future of energy policies around the world at a time when many hope to see a "nuclear renaissance."},

In this paper we study a logical architecture using input/output operations corresponding to the functionality of logical components. We illustrate how the architectural approach can be used to develop a logic of a normative system based on logics of counts-as conditionals, institutional constraints, obligations and permissions. In this example we adapt for counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints a proposal of Jones and Sergot, and for obligations and permissions we adapt the input/output logic framework of Makinson and van der Torre. We use our architecture to study logical relations among counts-as conditionals, institutional constraints, obligations and permissions. We show that in our logical architecture the combined system of counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints reduces to the logic of institutional constraints, which again reduces to an expression in the underlying base logic. Counts-as conditionals and institutional constraints are defined as a pre-processing step for the regulative norms. Permissions are defined as exceptions to obligations and their interaction is characterized.},

There are probably plenty of strong claims about dynamic languages that I'd be skeptical of if I heard them, but I'm not in the right communities to hear the stronger claims about dynamically typed languages. Either way, it's rare to see people cite actual evidence. Let's take a look at the empirical evidence that backs up these claims. Click here if you just want to see the summary without having to wade through all the studies. The summary of the summary is that most studies find very small effects, if any. However, the studies probably don't cover contexts you're actually interested in. If you want the gory details, here's each study, with its abstract, and a short blurb about the study.},

abstract = {Norms guide multi-agent systems away from being potentially an- archic towards a coordinated and collaborative society. Institutions provide an explicit, external representation of norms as well as the means to detect violations and other conditions. Each institution can be crafted individually to capture their designers' goals, but this creates a challenge at higher levels of authority in guiding the institutional design to be coordinated with other institutions and not imposing unacceptable limits on agents' rights. We propose to use institutions to govern and to revise institutions, following a princi- ple widely encountered in the social world, where treaties, primary legislation, framework agreements and subsidiarity establish a reg- ulatory space by defining norms on the form of a body of regula- tion. We set out a formal and computational framework, building on the InstAL model and implementation, to construct tiers of in- stitutions, where the norms at each tier are governed by those at the tier above. Thus, agents' behaviour is governed and monitored by a tier-1 institution, whose norms are governed and monitored by a tier-2 institution, etc.. This allows us to check the compliance of an institution with the tier above. Compliance failure generates the necessary examples for automatic norm-revision.},

We present a logic called DDLA (Deterministic Dynamic logic of Agency) which supports reasoning about actions and joint actions of agents and coalitions, and agentive and coalitional capabilities. InDDLA it is supposed that, once all agents have selected a joint action, the effect of this joint action is deterministic. In order to assessDDLAwe prove that it embeds Coalition Logic. We then extendDDLA with modal operators for agents' preferences, and show that the resulting logic is sufficiently expressive to capture the game-theoretic concepts of best response and Nash equilibrium.},

Differently from other logics of individual and coalitional capability such as Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) and Coalition Logic, in DLA cooperation modalities for expressing powers of agents and coalitions are not primitive, but are defined from more basic dynamic logic operators of action and (historic) necessity. We show that STIT logic can be reconstructed in DLA. We then extend DLA with epistemic operators, which allows us to distinguish capability and power. We finally characterize the conditions under which agents are aware of their capabilities and powers. TS - JSTOR},

abstract = {In 2001, Norwegian tax records became easily accessible online, allowing individuals to observe the incomes of others. Because of self-image and social-image concerns, higher income transparency can increase the differences in well-being between rich and poor. We test this hypothesis using survey data from 1985-2013. We identify the causal effect of income transparency on subjective well-being by using differences-in-differences, triple-differences, and event-study analyses. We find that higher income transparency increased the happiness gap between rich and poor by 29{\%} and the life satisfaction gap by 21{\%}. Additionally, higher income transparency corrected misperceptions about the income distribution and changed preferences for redistribution. Last, we use the estimates for back-of-the-envelope calculations of the value of self-image and social-image.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. We proposed a novel framework for the representation of goals and other mental-like attitudes in terms of degree of expected outcomes, where an outcome is an order of possible alternatives. The sequences of alternatives is modelled by a non-classical (substructural) operator. In this paper we provide a modal logic based axiomatisation of the intuition they propose, and we discuss some variants (in particular for the notion of social intention, intentions that are compliant with norms). Given that the outcome operator is substructural, we first propose a novel sequence semantics (a generalisation of possible world semantics) to model the outcome operator, and we prove that the axiomatisation is sound and complete with respect to the new semantics.},

abstract = {In audio signal processing, probabilistic time-frequency models have many benefits over their non-probabilistic counterparts. They adapt to the incoming signal, quantify uncertainty, and measure correlation between the signal's amplitude and phase information, making time domain resynthesis straightforward. However, these models are still not widely used since they come at a high computational cost, and because they are formulated in such a way that it can be difficult to interpret all the modelling assumptions. By showing their equivalence to Spectral Mixture Gaussian processes, we illuminate the underlying model assumptions and provide a general framework for constructing more complex models that better approximate real-world signals. Our interpretation makes it intuitive to inspect, compare, and alter the models since all prior knowledge is encoded in the Gaussian process kernel functions. We utilise a state space representation to perform efficient inference via Kalman smoothing, and we demonstrate how our interpretation allows for efficient parameter learning in the frequency domain.},

Compared to existing resources that center around taxonomic knowledge, ATOMIC focuses on inferential knowledge organized as typed if-then relations with variables (e.g., "if X pays Y a compliment, then Y will likely return the compliment"). We propose nine if-then relation types to distinguish causes vs. effects, agents vs. themes, voluntary vs. involuntary events, and actions vs. mental states. By generatively training on the rich inferential knowledge described in ATOMIC, we show that neural models can acquire simple commonsense capabilities and reason about previously unseen events. Experimental results demonstrate that multitask models that incorporate the hierarchical structure of if-then relation types lead to more accurate inference compared to models trained in isolation, as measured by both automatic and human evaluation.},

abstract = {Although one of the most durable analytic frameworks in political science, policy typologies suffer from some well-known Jaws. Key among these is the problem of classification: thus fa7 it has proved impossible to con-sistently and objectively assign specific policies into conceptually distinct cat-egories. The ambitious original promise ofpolicy typologies, that is, to provide a precursor to a general theory ofpolitics has gone unfulfilled in no small part because of the inability to overcome the classification obstacle. This article reexamines the idea of policy classification by assessing the potential contri-butions of policy taxonomies. Although a taxonomic approach to policy clas-sification raises problems of its own, it may offer advantages above and beyond traditional typologies. Policy typologies are one of the most durable analytical frameworks in political science. Originally conceived by Lowi nearly 40 years ago (1964, 19721, numerous variants of policy typologies provide theoretical structure for a broad range of scholarship (e.g., Schneider {\&} Ingram, 1997; Lowi, 1998; Mooney 1999; McCool, 1995, pp. 244-250). The typological approach, however, has well-known flaws. Typologies draw their theoretical strength from the idea that public policies can be systematically classified and that associated with each policy category are dis-tinct and predictable patterns of political behavior. The central difficulty for typolo-gies is establishing some means to objectively assign policies into conceptually dis-tinct categories. Once considered a natural precursor to a general understanding of politics, the theoretical promise of typologies has been consistently frustrated by the inability to construct a system for valid and reliable classification (Greenberg, Miller, Mohr, {\&} Vladeck, 1977; Steinberger, 1980). I argue a potential solution to the clas-sification problem lies in the empirical (as opposed to conceptual) construction of policy categories. This is an argument for a taxonomy rather than a typology of pol-icy The article proceeds with an overview of the typology literature and the central importance of the classification problem, examines the merits of adopting taxo-nomic methods, and presents an expository example by constructing a taxonomy based on morality policy theory, a typology-based framework at the heart of broad and newly aggressive research literature (for surveys, see Mooney, 1999; Tatalovich {\&} Daynes, 1998).},

SNIF-ACT selects actions based on the measure of information scent, which is calculated by a spreading activation mechanism that captures the mutual relevance of the contents of a WWW page to the goal of the user. There are two main predictions of SNIF-ACT: (1) users working on unfamiliar tasks are expected to choose links that have high information scent, (2) users will leave a site when the information scent of the site diminishes below a certain threshold. SNIF-ACT produced good fits to data collected from four users working on two tasks each. The results suggest that the current content-based spreading activation SNIF-ACT model is able to generate useful predictions about complex user-WWW interactions.},

abstract = {Individual perceptions of income distribution play a vital role in political economy and public finance models, yet there is little evidence regarding their origins or accuracy. This study examines how individuals form these perceptions and explores their potential impact on preferences for redistribution. A tailored household survey provides original evidence on systematic biases in individuals' evaluations of their own relative position in the income distribution. The study discusses one of the mechanisms that may generate such biases, based on the extrapolation of information from endogenous reference groups, and presents some suggestive evidence that this mechanism has significant explanatory power. The impact of these biased perceptions on attitudes toward redistributive policies is studied by means of an experimental design that was incorporated into the survey, which provided consistent information on the own-ranking within the income distribution to a randomly selected group of respondents. The evidence suggests that those who had overestimated their relative position and thought that they were relatively richer than they were tend to demand higher levels of redistribution when informed of their true ranking. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

As the production of the cloth required less quantity of labour in Portugal, it has been commonly inferred that this country had a production cost advantage over England in cloth making. The paper proves this inference wrong by showing that the English cloth had a lower cost of production, in money, than the Portuguese cloth. This novel interpretation of the numerical example also reveals that Ricardo deployed there the very same rule for specialisation as Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations, rebutting the widespread belief that he had formulated a new law, principle or rule for international specialisation, known as comparative advantage. Thus, the popular contraposition of Smith's absolute versus Ricardo's comparative cost advantage has to be dismissed.},

abstract = {Glyphs (also referred to as icons) are graphical entities that convey one or more data values via attributes such as shape, size, color, and position. They have been widely used in the visualization of data and information, and are especially well suited for displaying complex, multivariate data sets. The placement or layout of glyphs on a display can communicate significant information regarding the data values themselves as well as relationships between data points, and a wide assortment of placement strategies have been developed to date. Methods range from simply using data dimensions as positional attributes to basing placement on implicit or explicit structure within the data set. This paper presents an overview of multivariate glyphs, a list of issues regarding the layout of glyphs, and a comprehensive taxonomy of placement strategies to assist the visualization designer in selecting the technique most suitable to his or her data and task. Examples, strengths, weaknesses, and design considerations are given for each category of technique. We conclude with some general guidelines for selecting a placement strategy, along with a brief description of some of our future research directions.},

abstract = {There are many algorithm texts that provide lots of well-polished code and proofs of correctness. This book is not one of them. Instead, this book presents insights, notations, and analogies to help the novice describe and think about algorithms like an expert. By looking at both the big picture and easy step-by-step methods for developing algorithms, the author helps students avoid the common pitfalls. He stresses paradigms such as loop invariants and recursion to unify a huge range of algorithms into a few meta-algorithms. Part of the goal is to teach the students to think abstractly. Without getting bogged with formal proofs, the book fosters a deeper understanding of how and why each algorithm works. These insights are presented in a slow and clear manner accessible to second- or third-year students of computer science, preparing them to find their own innovative ways to solve problems.},

abstract = {Practical programming is one of the basic skills pursued in computer science education. On programming courses, the coursework consists of programming assignments that need to be assessed from different points of view. Since the submitted assignments are executable programs with a formal structure, some features can be assessed automatically. The basic requirement for automated assessment is the numerical measurability of assessment targets, but semiautomatic approaches can overcome this restriction. Recognizing automatically assessable features can help teachers to create educational models, where automatic tools let teachers concentrate their work on the learning issues that need student-teacher interaction the most. Several automatic tools for both static and dynamic assessment of computer programs have been reported in the literature. This article promotes these issues by surveying several automatic approaches for assessing programming assignments. Not all the existing tools will be covered, simply because of the vast number of them. The article concentrates on bringing forward different assessment techniques and approaches to give an interested reader starting points for finding further information in the area. Automatic assessment tools can be used to help teachers in grading tasks as well as to support students' working process with automatic feedback. Common advantages of automation are the speed, availability, consistency and objectivity of assessment. However, automatic tools emphasize the need for careful pedagogical design of the assignment and assessment settings. To effectively share the knowledge and good assessment solutions already developed, better interoperability and portability of the tools is needed.},

abstract = {The phrase, ‘institutional logic' has become somewhat of a buzz-word. Buzz words are over used; as a result their meanings often get distorted and overextended and they burn-out of existence. Mizruchi and Fein (1999) showed in the institutional theory literature how meanings get distorted and then taken for granted. To avoid misunderstandings of the institutional logic concept and to build on research in this genre, now is the time to reflect on definitions and the theoretical and methodological contributions this perspec- tive brings to the analysis of institutions. We begin by defining the concept of an institutional logic and how it emerged as part of the development of institutional theory since the 1970s. Second, we illustrate the institutional logics approach as both a meta- theory and a method of analysis. Third, we present a select review of the literature emphasizing how the institutional logics approach makes headway in addressing sev- eral limitations and tensions identified by scholars of institutional analysis. In this review we focus on an analysis of the implicit and explicit social mechanisms employed in these studies, not on the description or strength of their empirical findings. Last, we critique the literature on institutional logics and suggest how the approach can be used to further advance the study of organizations and institutions.},
