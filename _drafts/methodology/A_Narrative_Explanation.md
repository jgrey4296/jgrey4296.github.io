# Institutions and Mental Models 
## Why Do I Find Institutions Interesting

    Institutions are behemoths. 
    They are the super-structures in our lives which provide meaning.
    They are ephemeral, ravenous, and they kill.
        
    But it is hard to talk about them. When the words you use derive
    meaning from the thing you are trying to describe, language rapidly
    becomes imprecise; and abstracted. 

    The lived experience of people subjected to, benefiting from, 
    and constructing in day to day life of institutions is crucial. 

    Where multiple institutions meet, they can create conflict.
    They can compound the difficulties of someone's day to day life.

## Explorables and Mental Possibility Space

    I dream of being able to map, in a straight forward way,
    of how I understand the world to work;
    And then having someone else be able to identify where their understanding
    diverges.
