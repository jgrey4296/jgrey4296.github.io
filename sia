Socio-Institutional Actions. 

If we characterise the scope of systems surrounding an individual in the way of Bronfenbrenner:
a) Individual
b) Microsystem
c) Meso System
d) ExoSystem
e) MacroSystem

Then I am proposing a system that, leveraging the interpersonal
capabilities of CiF and Praxis, enables actions on a dynamic higher
system. Actions that, due to the authorizations and culture of a
society, have a greater impact that on just the relationship with the
other person, while that interpersonal aspect remains a factor.

This has a broad structure of:
Individual -> Speech Acts -> Social Fields Changes -> Individual Behaviour Changes

A Core component of this is Gidden's discussion of routinization,
regularization, and time.






-------------------- Core Research
Bourdieu - Fields, Conception of Symbolic Power, discusses in relation to speech acts
Giddens - Duality of Social Existence, Time
Castelfranchi - Types of Social Actions
Fligstein - Structure for Social Fields
Searle - Speech Acts
Dimaggio - Institutional Structures
Brandom - Considering Speech acts as pragmatically sufficient metavocabularies to bootstrap social field manipulations to.
Greene - Real World Examples

------------ Examples:

-------- First Tier
Gormenghast -> House of Cards -> Hannibal. Steerpike and Lecter. Sociopathic exploration of norm violation.
Stand on Zanzibar -> Discworld{Guards,Moist Von Lipwig, The Truth} -> Red Mars -> The Dispossessed -> Horus Heresy. Society Generation.
The Trial -> Gormenghast. Ritual.
On Politics -> 48 Laws of Power -> The Stars my Destination -> Dune. Politics

-------- Second Tier
Sociology: Graeber, Bitchierri, Benedict, Martin. Specific Examples of the variety of culturally specific norms.
Psychology: Forsyth
The soundscape, private life, Political Economy of Noise. On the effects of technologies on a culture.
By the sword. - For linking with Social Roguelikes and Fencing.


-------------------- Methods: 
Machine Learning. Classifiers and Repeated Relearning on multiple scales of simulation. 
Bloom filters as a particular form of guaranteed classification
Cellular Autonoma,
Genetic Algorithms,
Rete Net Pattern matching -> making larger numbers of rules feasible, allowing generation of large sets of rules.

through to the next level, you're talking your way in.
