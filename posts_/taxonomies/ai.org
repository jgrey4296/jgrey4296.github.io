** MOISE Notes
*** MAP-EASSS10.pdf notes
**** *Moise*
    Tag based language
    OMI has dedicated organisational artifacts and agents.

    Environment
    Structural Specification (Groups, links, roles, compatibilities, inheritance)
    Behaviours (Env/Org_spec/Func_spec/global constraints) + Normative Spec
    Functional Specification (Goals, plans, missions, schemas, preferences)


    Specifies structure along three levels:
    1) Individual with Role
    2) Social with Link
    3) Collective with Group

***** Role Specification
     Id, inheritance

***** Group Sepcification
     Id, Roles + cardinality, links, subgroups + cardinality, formation constraints

***** Link Specification
     From/To Roles,
     Type (authority, communication, acquaintance)
     Scope (inter, intra)     *IMPORTANT*
     validity (extends-sub-group)

***** Formation Constraint Specification
     Compatibility: from/to, scope, extends, bi-directional

***** Functional Specification
     Collective: Scheme
     Individual: Mission

     Goals (id, type: Achievement/maintenance, min_agents, plan). States:
     waiting, ready, satisfied, impossible. Scheme (id, goal, missions)
     Missions (id, cardinality, goals)

***** Norm Specification
     Norm (id, type: obligation/permission, conditions, role, mission,
     time_constraint)

***** Org Dynamics
     Creation,
     Agent adoption of roles
     Group responsibility for schemes
     Agents commit to missions
     Agents fulfil goals
     Agent leave schemes and groups
     Scehems and group instances are destroyed

***** Normative PRogramming Langauge (NPL: Hubner 2010)
     Activation condition, consequence (regimentation/obligation)
     Norm life cycle: start -> Active -> [fulfilled, unfulfilled,inactive] -> end
     Has Count-as Rules (input)  and Enact Rules (output).
***** Soccer Team Example
     As EL:?
     .soc.coach
     .soc.player.[back, left, right, attacker, goalkeeper]

     #all leaves: ..*, all children: .*
     x <- .soc.player..*
     #rest operator
     .soc.team.[..x]
     #then spread. bidirectal op.
     x.links.coach <-> .soc.coach.links.x..

     .soc.player.[leader, middle, attacker].group.attack
     .soc.player.[leader, back, goalkeeper].group.defense

     .people.dida.role.(.soc.player.goalkeeper)
     .people.lucio.role.(.soc.player.back)
     .people.juan.role.(.soc.player.back)
     .people.cafu.role.(.soc.player.leader)

**** AOSE: Agent-Oriented Software Development Methodology
    Requirement -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Test
    Abstractions:
    1) Individual Agent Level
       a) Cognitive concepts: BDI
       b) Deliberation and decision: Sense/Reason/Act etc
    2) Multi-Agent Level: Social and ORganizational Structures
       1) Roles: Functionalities, activities, and responsibilities
       2) Organizational Rules: Norms, Deadlines, Obligations
       3) Organizational Structures: Topology of interaction patterns
    3) Environment: Resources and Services that MAS can access and control

    Agent Oriented Programming Proposed by *Shoham 1993*.
    Separation of Concerns: Agents/Organisations/Enivronment
    *Not a Mature Paradigm*
**** The State of Multi-Agent Programming
    Right way is to use an AOSE Methodology (Prometheus, Gaia)
    *Shortfalls*: ides and debugging are not mature,
    debugging more than 'mind tracing' is needed.
    Combination with organisational models is only recent.
    Declarative goals are not standard.
    Large applications are lacking.

    *Trends*: Modularity, Debugging, Logics,
    Need to put everything together: Rational agents, environments,
    organisations, normative systems, reputation system, economically inspired techniques.

**** Json / AgentSpeak
    *Rao 1996*
    BDI language

    Main Constructs: Beliefs, Goals, Plans, Events, Intentions
    Architectural Components: Belief Base, Event Set, Plan Library, Intention Set

    Interpreter Cycle: Perceive, update belief base, process messages, select event, select relevant plans,
    select applicable plans, create/update intention, select intention to execute
***** AgentSpeak Syntax
     Annotated First order Logic
     eg: red(box1)[source(percept)]
     Percepts are updated automatically.

     + and - can add and remove beliefs.
     eg: +liar(alice)

     can Tell other agents information:
     eg: .send(tom,tell,liar(alice))

     Goals:
     Achievement Goals. things to do.
     eg: !friends(bob,bill)

     Test Goals, things to know.
     eg: ?friendsOf(bob)

     Goals are annotated with source(self), or the source of the agent who initiated the goals.
     eg: bob.send(tom, achieve, write(book)) -> !write(book)[source(bob)]
     eg: bob.send(tom,askOne,published(P), Answer) -> ?publisher(P)[source(bob)]

     Events trigger plans, possible events being:
     +b, -b, +!g, -!g, +?g, -?g

     Plans look like:
     triggering_event : context <- body

     Plans can be initially defined, dynamically added by plans,
     or told and untold by other agents.

     Dynamically asking for plans:
     -!G[error(no_relevant)] : teacher(T)
     <- .send(T, askHow, { +!G }, Plans);
     .add_plan(Plans);
     !G.

     Agents can perform internal actions, that do not change the environment.

**** Environment Oriented Programming
    Structuring. Physical / communication / social
    Embed resources / services
    Encapsulate state / processes
    Ruling and governing functions

    Existing frameworks:
    AGRE / AGREEN / MASQ

    GOLEM

    A&A, CArtAgO.

    Simple taxonomy:
    Individual/personal artifacts - functionality for single agent use
    Social Artifacts - functionality for managing interactions / coordination
    Boundary artifacts - external resources

    Link interfaces

**** Organisation Oriented Programming
    Gasser, Malone, Bernoux, Morin.

    Organisations are *supra-individual* phenomena.
    Definition is by the designer/actors to achieve a purpose.
    Have a pattern of predefined cooperation
    Have a pattern of emergent cooperation.

    Bernoux: Org characterised by:
    1) Division of tasks,
    2) Distribution of roles,
    3) Authority systems
    4) Communication systems
    5) contribution-retribution systems

    Distinction between organisation entity and organisation specification.
    *Entity*: institution, social relations, commitments. Emergent and potential cooperation.
    Local representations of agent mental states.

    *Specification*: Predefined cooperation, structure, norms.
    Partially/totally accessable.


    Org as a *first class entity*
    Distinction between org, agents, environment.

***** Organisation Modelling Language
     Declarative specification
     Constraints, norms, cooperation patterns.
     Specific anchors for situating orgs within environment
     Examples:
     AGR, TeamCore, Islander, Moise+.

     Org Management Infrastructure:
     Coordination mechanisms: MadKit, Karma
     Regulation Mechanisms: Ameli, S-Mois+, ORA4MAS
     Agent Integration Mechanisms: enter/exit/mod org, obedience/violation of norms, sanctions/rewards
     Environment Integration Mechanisms: transformation/ org acting on environment. Env as org (count-as rules).

     An Organisation helps agents cooperate by defining common cooperation schemes.
     Tasks, protocols, groups, responsibilities.

     Embedding norms within org constrains agents behaviour towards global purposes of the org.

     AGR: Ferber and Gutknecht. Agent, Group, Role.
     Structural Specification + Behaviour
     Subsets of Behaviour:
     1) Behaviours that lead to global purpose,
     2) Behaviours constrained by environment
     3) Behaviours structurally constrained by org

     STEAM:
     adds Functional specification and:
     4a) Behaviours functionally constrained by org

     ISLANDER:
     Replaces functional spec with dialogical spec
     4b) Behaviours possible/permitted/obliged interactionally

***** 2OPL
     Agents - Org.
     Agents perform external actions,
     Org Monitors norm transgressions, enforces sanctions, and regiments to prevent critical failure states.

     Brute facts.
     Effects of actions.
     Norm / counts-as rules.
     Sanction rules.

**** Conclusion
    Agents + Orgs + Environments + Interactions.
    AOP, EP, OOP as orthogonal dimensions.
    Beyond Orthogonality: *Synergetic Integration*

    Ricci (2009): Externalization - (Seems similar to smart objects in the Sims)

**** Examples

***** Prometheus
     Having Layers of System Specification, Architectural Design, and Detailed Design.

***** Gaia
     Requirements -> Analysis -> Architectural Design -> Detailed Design
     Has initial Subdivisions of system into sub-organisations, flowing into
     role models and interaction models, eventually into agent and service models.

***** PRS (Georgeff, Lansky)

*** Thoughts
   Repeated mentions of debugging being hard, and mind-traces not being enough.
   What *is* needed to debug complex agent organisations?
   Knowledge of:
   1) External Environment state,
   2) External Agent State
   3) Internal Agent State (*Mind Traces Here*)
   4) Identified problematic behaviour
   5) Action / Action Sequence that is problematic
   6) Causes of that Action Sequence
   7) Related orgaizations / institutions to that sequence
   8) Organizational structure
   9) Relevant Norms, and their support (Norms assessed in a way similar to SVMs?)
   10) Agent's location in organization
   11) Agent's that specified the rule / goal
*** Moise notes from shell
**** Organisational Spec
    Description of components

    Structural Spec - Roles, components etc
    Deontic/Normative Spec - link roles to permissions/obligations,
    Functional Spec - Action/Activity descriptions
    Environment Spec - Physical interface

    Translation of roles -> actions as intersection of sets based on permission, environment etc
**** Organisation Entity
    Instantiation of Spec.
    Map Agents -> Roles
    Track Agents -> Roles -> Activities
