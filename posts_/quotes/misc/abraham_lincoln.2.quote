Gettysburg Address, 1863

We the people are the rightfull masters of both Congress and the courts, not to
overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.

We here highly resolve... that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.
