The accident is an inverted miracle, a secular miracle, a revelation.
When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck;
when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash;
and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution...
Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.
- Politics of the Very Worst.
