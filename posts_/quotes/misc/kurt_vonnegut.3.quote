Dear Xavier High School, and Ms. Lockwood, and Messrs Perin, McFeely,
Batten, Maurer and Conglusta:

I thank you for your friendly letters. You sure know how to cheer up a
really old geezer (84) In his sunset years. I don’t make public appearances any
more because I now resemble nothing so much as an iguana.

What I had to say to you, moreover, would not take long, to wit: Practice
any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry,
fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or badly, not to get money and
fame, but to experience becoming, to find out what's Inside you, to make your
soul grow.

Seriously! I mean starting right now, do art and do it for the rest of your
lives. Draw a funny or nice picture of Ms. Lockwood, and give It to her. Dance
home after school, and sing In the shower and on and on. Make a face in your
mashed potatoes. Pretend you're Count Dracula.

Here’s an assignment for tonight, and I hope Ms. Lockwood will flunk you
if you don't do It: Write a six line poem, about anything, but rhymed. No fair
tennis without a net. Make It as good as you possibly can. But don’t tell
anybody what you're doing. Don’t show It or recite It to anybody, not even
your girlfriend or parents or whatever, or Ms. Lockwood. OK?

Tear it up Into teeny-weeny pieces, and discard them Into widely
separated trash recepticals. You will find that you have already been gloriously
rewarded for your poem. You have experienced becoming, learned a lot more

about what's Inside you, and you have made your soul grow.

God bless you alll

Kurt Vonnegut
