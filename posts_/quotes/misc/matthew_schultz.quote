“You’re allowed to believe in a god. You’re allowed to believe unicorns live in
your shoes for all I care. But the day you start telling me how to wear my shoes
so I don’t upset the unicorns, I have a problem with you. The day you start
involving the unicorns in making decisions for this country, I have a BIG
problem with you.”
