 “The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like him, and that
 the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are,
 terribly and terrifyingly normal. From the viewpoint of our legal institutions
 and of our moral standards of judgment, this normality was much more terrifying
 than all the atrocities put together.”
