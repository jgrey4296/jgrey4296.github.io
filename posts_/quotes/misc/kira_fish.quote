Our capitalist society
prioritizes production and
efficiency above all else,
and this is pervasive
throughout academia.

When we don't allow for restful
periods, we don't allow for the
regenerative growth that is
required for new ideas to flourish.
New ideas are a cornerstone of
academia, and we must prioritize
the health of academics.
