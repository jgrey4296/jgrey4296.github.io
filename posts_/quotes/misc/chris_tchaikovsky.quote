"Taking the most hurt people out of society and punishing them in order to teach
them how to live within society is futile. Whatever else a prisoner knows, she
knows everything there is to know about punishment because that is exactly what
she has grown up with. Whther it's childhood sexual abuse, indifference or
neglect - punishment is most familiar to her."
