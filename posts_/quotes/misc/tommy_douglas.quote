 "Once more, let me remind you what fascism is. I need not wear a brown shirt or a green shirt.
Fascism begins the moment a ruling class, fearing the people may use their political democracy to gain
economic democracy, begins to destroy political democracy in order to retains its power of exploitation
and special privilege."
