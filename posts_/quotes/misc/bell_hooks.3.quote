Moving From Silence Into Speech Is For
The Oppressed, The Colonized, The
Exploited, and Those Who Stand In
Struggle Side By Side A Gesture Of
Defiance That Heals, That Makes New
Life and New Growth Possible. It Is That
Act Of Speech, Of â€œTalking Back" That Is
No Mere Gesture Of Empty Words, That Is
The Expression Of Our Movement From
Object To Subject-The Liberated Voice.
