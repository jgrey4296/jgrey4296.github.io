# Summary:

The man or woman who proclaims devotion
to the cause of liberation yet is unable to
enter into communion with the people,
whom he or she continues to regard as
totally ignorant, is grievously self-deceived.
The convert who approaches the people but
feels alarm at each step they take, each
doubt they express, and each suggestion
they offer, and attempts to impose his
"status," remains nostalgic towards his
origins.
