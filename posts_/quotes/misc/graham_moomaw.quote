" State elections commisioner confirms that 83 voters in Fredericksburg were
assigned to wrong House District. They were supposed to be in HD28, where
the Republican leads by 82 votes.

Basically an entire street in Fredericksburg may be screwed up.
The former registrar who made the changes is dead. The new registrar doesn't
know what happened."
