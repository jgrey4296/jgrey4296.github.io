Beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma survivors there exists an
undamaged essence, a self that is confident, curious, and calm, a self that has
been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival.
Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the self will spontaneously emerge,
and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process.
