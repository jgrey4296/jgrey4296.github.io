‘Imagine a piece of music which expresses love. It is not love for any particular
person. Another piece of music will express another love. Here we have two distinct
emotional atmospheres, two different fragrances, and in both cases the quality of love
will depend upon its essence and not upon its object. Nevertheless, it is hard to conceive
a love which is, so to speak, at work, and yet applies to nothing.’
