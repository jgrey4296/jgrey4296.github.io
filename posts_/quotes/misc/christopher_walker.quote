People who think we need "Straight Pride Parades" or a "White History Month" are kinda like people
who look at handicapped parking spaces and say "Why don't I get something like that, huh?"
They don't care why it exists,
They don't care that they get the whole parking lot,
They're just mad that there's 4 spaces in front of the walmart that aren't just for them.
