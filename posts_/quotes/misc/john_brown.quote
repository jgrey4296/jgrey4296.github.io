I believe to have interfered as I have done... on behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong,
but right. Now, if it be deemed necesssary that I should forfeit my life for the
furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children,
and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel and unjust
enactments, I submit: so let it be done.
