One day, on tearing off some old bark, I saw two rare beetles and seized one in each hand;
then I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I popped the one
which I held in my right hand into my mouth.
Alas it ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was
forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as well as the third one.
