Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is
just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that’s invented between
when you’re fifteen and thirty- five is new and exciting and revolutionary and
you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five
is against the natural order of things.
