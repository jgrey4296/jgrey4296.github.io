“Aristocrats don't notice philosophical conundra. They just ignore them.
Philosophy includes contemplating the possibility that you might be wrong, sir,
and a real aristocrat knows that he is always right. It's not vanity, you
understand, it's built-in absolute certainty. They may sometimes be as mad as a
hatful of spoons, but they are always definitely and certainly mad.”
