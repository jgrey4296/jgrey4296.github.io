# Summary:

God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of his own
devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other
players, to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch
dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a dealer who won't tell
you the rules, and who smiles all the time.
