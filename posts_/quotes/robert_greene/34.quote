*** Law 34: Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated like one

   The way you carry yourself will often determine
   how you are treated; In the long run, appearing
   vulgar or common will make people disrespect you.
   For a king respects himself and inspires the same
   sentiment in others.  By acting regally and
   confident of your powers, you make yourself seem
   destined to wear a crown.
