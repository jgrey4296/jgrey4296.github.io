*** Law 4: Always Say Less than Necessary

   When you are trying to impress people with words,
   the more you say, the more common you appear, and
   the less in control.  Even if you are saying
   something banal, it will seem original if you make
   it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.  Powerful
   people impress and intimidate by saying less.  The
   more you say, the more likely you are to say
   something foolish.
