*** Law 24: Play the Perfect Courtier

   The perfect courtier thrives in a world where
   everything revolves around power and political
   dexterity.  He has mastered the art of
   indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and
   asserts power over others in the mot oblique and
   graceful manner.  Learn and apply the laws of
   courtiership and there will be no limit to how far
   you can rise in the court.
