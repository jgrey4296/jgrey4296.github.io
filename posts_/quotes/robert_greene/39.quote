*** Law 39: Stir up Waters to Catch Fish

   Anger and emotion are strategically
   counterproductive.  You must always stay calm and
   objective.  But if you can make your enemies angry
   while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided
   advantage.  Put your enemies off-balance: Find the
   chink in their vanity through which you can rattle
   them and you hold the strings.
