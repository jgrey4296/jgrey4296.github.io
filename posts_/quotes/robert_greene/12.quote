*** Law 12: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim

   One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens
   of dishonest ones.  Open-hearted gestures of
   honesty and generosity bring down the guard of
   even the most suspicious people.  Once your
   selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you
   can deceive and manipulate them at will.  A timely
   gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same
   purpose.
