*** Law 5: So Much Depends on Reputation â€“ Guard it with your Life

   Reputation is the cornerstone of power.  Through
   reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once
   you slip, however, you are vulnerable, and will be
   attacked on all sides.  Make your reputation
   unassailable.  Always be alert to potential
   attacks and thwart them before they happen.
   Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by
   opening holes in their own reputations.  Then
   stand aside and let public opinion hang them.
