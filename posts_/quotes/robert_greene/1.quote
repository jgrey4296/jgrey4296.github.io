*** Law 1: Never Outshine the Master

   Always make those above you feel comfortably
   superior.  In your desire to please or impress
   them, do not go too far in displaying your talents
   or you might accomplish the opposite â€“ inspire
   fear and insecurity.  Make your masters appear
   more brilliant than they are and you will attain
   the heights of power.
