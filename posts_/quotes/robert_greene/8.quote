*** Law 8: Make other People come to you – use Bait if Necessary

   When you force the other person to act, you are
   the one in control.  It is always better to make
   your opponent come to you, abandoning his own
   plans in the process.  Lure him with fabulous
   gains – then attack.  You hold the cards.
