*** Law 3: Conceal your Intentions

   Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never
   revealing the purpose behind your actions.  If
   they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot
   prepare a defense.  Guide them far enough down the
   wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by
   the time they realize your intentions, it will be
   too late.
