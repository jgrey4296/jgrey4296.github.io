*** Law 14: Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy

   Knowing about your rival is critical.  Use spies
   to gather valuable information that will keep you
   a step ahead.  Better still: Play the spy
   yourself.  In polite social encounters, learn to
   probe.  Ask indirect questions to get people to
   reveal their weaknesses and intentions.  There is
   no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful
   spying.
