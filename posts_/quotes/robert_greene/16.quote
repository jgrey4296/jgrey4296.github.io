*** Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor

   Too much circulation makes the price go down: The
   more you are seen and heard from, the more common
   you appear.  If you are already established in a
   group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you
   more talked about, even more admired.  You must
   learn when to leave.  Create value through
   scarcity.
