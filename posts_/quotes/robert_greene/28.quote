*** Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness

   If you are unsure of a course of action, do not
   attempt it.  Your doubts and hesitations will
   infect your execution.  Timidity is dangerous:
   Better to enter with boldness.  Any mistakes you
   commit through audacity are easily corrected with
   more audacity.  Everyone admires the bold; no one
   honors the timid.
