*** Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles

   Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures
   create the aura of power â€“ everyone responds to
   them.  Stage spectacles for those around you, then
   full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that
   heighten your presence.  Dazzled by appearances,
   no one will notice what you are really doing.
