As R. Brooks said, the world is its own best model.
Language is fundamentally a tool for agents cooperating in worlds,
it’s not the right kind of model to underwrite interaction/control.
Fragments of institutionalized interaction schemes aren’t quite a model in the
needed way.

quoting:  yann lecun
Can language models be used as world models?
Not really.

No world model, no planning.
