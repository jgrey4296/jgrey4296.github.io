Fascinating hypothesis implied by Matt and Tyler. That genAl will increase destructive friction
because it makes it so easy to add more and more--and efficiency for subtraction will be ignored.

Dovetails with @Leidyklotz on subtraction and our organizational #frictionproject.

FYI. genAl => code bloat => feature bloat => process bloat => friction!
