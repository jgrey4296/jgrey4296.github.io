Doppleganger is really the first work that I've read that really tries to
contend with the shared psychological scars of pandemic
onlineness and shock as a collective experience.

It gets a lot right. It's worth reading.

The central metaphor is frequently strained to the breaking point,

but it never quite breaks and ends up encompassing a lot more
than I would have expected it to.
