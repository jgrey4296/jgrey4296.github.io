it's literally considered inhumane to deny
our worst criminals food and shelter but
y’all wanna figure out if our homeless and
impoverished population “deserves” it like

child molesters are gettin’ three hots and
a cot on your tax dollars and that's fine
but the starving single mother and her
children down the street should just work
harder bc god forbid your taxes go to
them?
