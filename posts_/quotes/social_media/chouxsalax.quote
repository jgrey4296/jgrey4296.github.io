 The Greatest trick the videogame industry ever pulled was convincing the world that videogames were games in the first place.
 Unlike traditional games in which voluntary rules are consciously chosen to further constrain
 or interpret the physical properties of dice and cards, balls and bats, or track and field,
 videogames conflate the rulse of a game with the mechanics of the equipment.
