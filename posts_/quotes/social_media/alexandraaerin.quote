If Handler's most famous work has any lessons to teach us, I think they would include the fact

The kind of moral complexity alluded to in the thread does not consist of
"This person is my friend, and has done great things, so he can't have done anything so bad"
That is the opposite of moral complexity. It's moral reductionism.
