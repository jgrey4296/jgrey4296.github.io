The reason that speaking
out is so important is that it
lowers the perceived risk of
those people who are still
silent but have something to
say. Your courage matters.
It makes the waters warmer.
Your words matter. They
assure others they are not
alone and encourage them to
speak. Every voice is a key to
unlocking another's.
