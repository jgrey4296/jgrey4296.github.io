I really don't think people understand how much of bureaucratic labor is just exception handling.

Much of the work that is easily automatable was automated in the 60s.

In general, I think we underestimate how much of frustration with government is a product of the collapse
of state capacity that came along with the atuomation wave of t he 70/80s.
