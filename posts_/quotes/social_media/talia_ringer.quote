“There is no reasonable answer to a question this unreasonable”

We need to ask a new question. We need new terminology. We need to be
specific, while also not ascribing vague and loaded terminology like "AGI" to
the specific questions we ask. That is where we are. There is no reasonable
answer to a question this unreasonable.
