Sometimes people use “respect” to mean “treating
someone like a person” and sometimes they use
“respect” to mean “treating someone like an authority”

and sometimes people who are used to being treated
like an authority say “if you won’t respect me I won’t
respect you” and they mean “if you won’t treat me like
an authority I won’t treat you like a person”

and they think they’re being fair but they aren’t, and
it’s not okay.
