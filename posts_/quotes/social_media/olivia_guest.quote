this seems to be a constant theme: people think a technoscientific embedding is evaluable based
on "use" alone

a technology is not just good/bad based on use; it can be also flawed in principle
(homeopathy for cancer cannot be made good by saying it's only for patients who say they enjoy it)
and it can be flawed in process (clothes are overall a good thing but not if made by children)
