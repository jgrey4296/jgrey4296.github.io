I want this to be a Hollywood institution. I want
a constant string of actors coming in to have a
blast in the latest Benoit Blanc film. I want the
BBCU to have a cast list as long as the MCU.

you could not hold me at gunpoint to watch the last two bond movies
but Iâ€™d watch Daniel Craig play this Gay Southern Detective in
another 50 murder mysteries. He clearly thrives in roles where he
actually gets to Play A Character and clearly have a lot of fun
