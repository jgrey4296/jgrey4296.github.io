What's your hottest literature take?

young women’s criticism of the (violent)
misogyny in “classic” lit should be taken
100% seriously. if a teen girl says the
rapey overtones of 1984 ruin the whole
book for her, she's not less intellectual.
this goes double for girls refusing to
read classics that are misogynistic
