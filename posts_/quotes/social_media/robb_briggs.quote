Alexei Othenin-Girard, yeah, I heard about him dying.
And yeah I did know about the Scientology. Used to go
to holiday parties at his house where he had a whole
wall bookcase full of scientology books. And pretty
much all the top execs at Neopets were Scientologists,
at least until he sold the company to Viacom.
