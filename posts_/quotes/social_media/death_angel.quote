my view of homeless people changed forever
when i learned that more than half of them were
foster kids who aged out of the system and
were left with no family or resources.

quoting: Zola In Recovery @WarriorZoltar

If you ever had a “move back in with your parents”
stage, you have no business judging homeless
people. The only difference between you and
them is you were privileged enough to have a
fallback.
