There has been a complete breakdown of civil society’s ability to question
government policy in the west. The journalists are all scared of losing their
jobs. The academics are all scared of losing their jobs. There is no civil society.
Only incompetent politicians. And the only journalists and academics who get
promoted are the ones who promote the same incompetent policies. It’s a circle of
incompetence.
