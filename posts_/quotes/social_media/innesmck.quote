your subscription to spotify isn't for music - pre-spotify we could all pirate music for free, without
compensating the artists. spotify is just a proxy which makes that same act legal, it's a
subscription service for stealing from musicians

quoting: @tedgioia

Did you know the CEO of Spotify is wealthier than any musician in historyâ€”and has 4X the net
worth of Paul McCartney?

Now you do.
