I build level 0 systems sometimes. It's a threefold approach:

- don't receive or store data
- don’t do anything “valuable”
- don’t let anyone know about them

replying: @leon@peoplemaking.games

@mcc engineers should fight against every data point that stakeholders think they want

I refer to this principle as MOE in meetings:
1. Minimal, but if absolutely required
2. Offline/Local first, but if it can’t be
3. Encrypted
