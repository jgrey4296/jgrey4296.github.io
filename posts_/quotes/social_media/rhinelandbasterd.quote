"This game is too damn hard and I can't get past the first level.
The enemis won't listo to my reasoned discourse on why their ideology is flawed
and just shoot me to death.
I have a lot of weapons at my disposal, but killing the nazis would make me as bad as them.
Does anyone have links to a walkthrough that would allow me to keep the moral high ground?"
