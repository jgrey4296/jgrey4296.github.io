From a conversation with a friend:

Tech should build more cathedrals, less in the religious sense and more in the "Make a
beautiful, physical space which is open to the public and will endure for hundreds of years to
say This ls Who We Were And What We Hoped, 2021 Edition."

Will allow partial credit for "Our cathedral is The Internet" but I don't think
that necessarily drains resources from doing it IRL, too.
