-Starry Night Over Gaza-

How high can a missile fly?
Does it graze the moon?
Can it reach the stars?
No?

Orphan child
let’s play a game—
let’s orbit the tent
the morgue
and the streets you called home
let’s gather your toys, your limbs and your
long lost smile
yes, your friends can come too
and mama will meet us there

Now step into my palm
let me scatter you, gently, across the sky
let me make constellations of your laughter
and turn your tears into stardust
so that when night falls
you are no longer afraid of the dark

And when the bombs chase us here on earth
I can look up from the rubble
see your twinkle
see your light @fatimazsaid
and know
that you have outlived the night
