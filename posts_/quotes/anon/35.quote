“Sympathy is easy. You have
sympathy for starving children
swatting at flies on the late-night
commercials. Sympathy is easy
because it comes from a position
of power.

Empathy is getting down on your
knees and looking someone else
in the eye, and realising that you
could be them, and that all that
separates you is luck.”
