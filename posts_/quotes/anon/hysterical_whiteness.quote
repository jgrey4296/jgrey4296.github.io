NOTE 215
Hysterical whiteness

Hysterical whiteness makes blackness the
provoking agent of the mass hysteria that is
the province of whiteness itself. It makes a
seventy-six-year-old white man shoot Darius Simmons, a thirteen-year-old Black
boy, in the chest and kill him in front of his screaming mother. Kill him in
order to teach him a lesson.

Hysterical whiteness is conquest pedagogy. Murder pedagogy.
