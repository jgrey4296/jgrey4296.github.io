The world will never starve for want of wonders, but
for want of wonder. We should always endeavor to
wonder at the permanent thing, not at the mere excep-
tion. We should be startled by the sun, and not by the
eclipse. We should wonder less at the earthquake, and
wonder more at the earth. What was wonderful about
childhood is that anything in it was a wonder. It was
not merely a world full of miracles; it was a miraculous
world.
