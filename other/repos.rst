1. `ACAB <https://github.com/jgrey4296/acab>`_ is a WIP Python based DSL for replicating Versu but for MAS.
2. `Doot <https://doot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, a Python Taskrunner that uses toml specifications.
3. `Dootle <https://github.com/jgrey4297/dootle>`_, a library of actions and commands for *Doot*.
4. `Instal <https://github.com/jgrey4296/instal-stable>`_, my refactoring and extension of the Python/ASP based Institution simulator.
5. `JGDV <https://jgdv.readthedocs.io>`_ is a library of code I keep finding I rewrite.
6. `Bibble <https://github.com/jgrey4296/bibble>`_ is a collection of middlewares and utilities for working with bibtex through `bibtexparser <https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser>`_.
7. `Sphinx Bib Domain <https://github.com/jgrey4296/sphinx_bib_domain>`_ is a simple RST domain for `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ to allow easy translation of bibtex to rst.
   Notably, it demonstrates custom indices for a webpage (tag, author, publisher, series aggregations), which is... not obvious to get working in sphinx.
8. `Blood <https://github.com/jgrey4296/blood>`_. First there was `Evil <https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil>`_, then `Doom <https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs>`_,
   and my attempt is Blood. A minimal Emacs module framework that tries to simplify bits I don't like about Doom, without forcing you to use my own preferences.
9. `Librarian <https://github.com/jgrey4296/librarian>`_.
10. `Project-Zimmerframe <https://github.com/jgrey4296/project-zimmerframe>`_.
11. `Spec-Handling <https://github.com/jgrey4296/spec-handling>`_.
12. `Evil-States-Plus <https://github.com/jgrey4296/evil-states-plus>`_.
13. `Code Shy <https://github.com/jgrey4296/code-shy-minor-mode>`_.
14. `Carousel <https://github.com/jgrey4296/carousel-minor-mode>`_.
