**** Results
     Simulation model able to generate social practices
     Mechanism for Behavioural lock-in identified 

**** Background
     

***** TODO Social Practice Theory?
      " Social practices involve consumption as performing the
      respective activities requires the usage of material artefacts
      as well as resources such as energy and water. Hence social
      practices such as showering (almost) every day or doing the
      laundry according to a specific standard of cleanness
      (Shove 2004) have a large impact on a society's resource use."

----
      "Jackson (2005) notes that "… our understanding of the dynamics
      of social practice, of the ways in which social practices
      evolve, and of the interaction between policy and social
      practice is as yet so limited that it would be difficult to see
      how policy could make use of this position…" (p. 63). "

     Practices. European Journal of Sociology, 5(2), 243–263. )

     "Individuals are seen as the 'carriers of practices' who do not
     freely choose between practices based on utility or similar
     individualistic concepts but are 'recruited' to practices
     according to their background and history (Reckwitz 2002)"

	Practices. Journal of Consumer Culture, 5(1),

    "Conceptualised the role of the material (bodily activities,
    technological artefacts) in social practices, that was mostly
    neglected in early practice theories, but which is crucial for
    analysing environmental effects of practices."

    A Practice is a configuration of three components: material, meaning and competence.

----

	"SPT doesn't conceptualise how the components 'glue together',
	ie. why certain elements form 'succesful' practices which diffuse
	and are maintained by a substantial part of society while other
	constellations of elements do not succeed."

**** Conceptual framework of social practices

***** Components
      Social practices as weak emergent property of the interaction of individual, compoents etc.
      Only first order convergence considered, not macro-level properties.
      Components linked by individuals when carrying out a practice.

****** Material
       Physical aspects of the performance of a practice. 
****** Meaning
       understandings, beliefs, emotions
****** Competence
       skills and knowledge which are required to perform the practice. 
       eg: driving skills, knowledge of public transport routes.

***** Coherence
     Coherence elaborated by Holtz.
     ( HOLTZ, G. (2012a). Coherence of social practices: the case of
     meat consumption. Unpublished working
     paper. http://www.usf.uos.de/institut/publikationen/forschungsgruppen/rem.html )
     ( HOLTZ, G. (2012b). An agent-based model of social practices. ESSA 2012 Proceedings. )

****** Cognitive consitency
       (alighning behaviours with beliefs / deontics)
       ie: meaning and material must fit.

****** habits over deliberated decisions
       ie: competence and material must fit.

***** social sharing practices

****** adapt meaning to material
       eg: learning about the environmental effects of car use may choose to go by bike

****** adapt competence to material
       eg: introduction of congestion charge in London + public
       transport investment to change transport preferences

****** habituation
       reinforced situation-goal-response connections.  Two different
       modes of behaviour:
******* deliberate choice of material
******* habitual behaviour keeping current material

****** adapt material
       
****** exchange meaning

**** Implementation
     Simple bitstrings.

*** [[./web_pages/Castelfranchi - Towards Institutional Actions.pdf][Towards Institutional Actions ]]
    Castelfranchi - 2005

    "Institutions are usually conceived as normative systems that
    structure social interactions" Economic models focus on 'the rules
    of the game' of:
    1) in the interest of individual agents
    2) that solve cooperation dilemmas

    Searle adds their conceptual nature into the mix, enabling
    constraint and influence on action capabilities, and normative consequences.

    As with Searle, Castelfranchi "takes the institutional actions as
    pior to the institution objects".

    Triadic Relation of:
    "X, seen as a token of a CT, counts as Y in C"

    "The double empowerment of tools and artifacts"
    
    On Function - "an external goal placed on a system that results in
    a transformation of the structural properties of the system",
    which "modify the shape of the system"

    Finalities of the action set A are:
    1) The subset a that produces effects unintended by, and unknown to the agent.

    Functional aspects are:
    1) Any item in the agent that produces the unintended effect through a casual feedback loop
       
    

**** Commentary
     C / Searle are taking actions as prior to  objects. How does this relate to Graeber / Debt?
     Debt exists before Money, but C uses the example of paying -> money.

     So:
     Paying -> Money
     Debt -> Money
     As:
     Institutional Action -> Institutional Object

     But is this really the case?
     Debt is an institutional concept, rather than an Action. 
     It is closer to Holtz three component distinction. Material, Meaning, Competence.
     So:
     Paying -> Material
     Money -> Artifact? 
     Debt -> Meaning
     ?    -> Competence

     Institutions are resonant groups of reinforcing actions, whose consequences are 
     unintended / non-obvious.
