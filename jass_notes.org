**** Background
     

***** TODO Social Practice Theory?
      " Social practices involve consumption as performing the
      respective activities requires the usage of material artefacts
      as well as resources such as energy and water. Hence social
      practices such as showering (almost) every day or doing the
      laundry according to a specific standard of cleanness
      (Shove 2004) have a large impact on a society's resource use."

----
      "Jackson (2005) notes that "… our understanding of the dynamics
      of social practice, of the ways in which social practices
      evolve, and of the interaction between policy and social
      practice is as yet so limited that it would be difficult to see
      how policy could make use of this position…" (p. 63). "

     "Individuals are seen as the 'carriers of practices' who do not
     freely choose between practices based on utility or similar
     individualistic concepts but are 'recruited' to practices
     according to their background and history (Reckwitz 2002)"

    "Conceptualised the role of the material (bodily activities,
    technological artefacts) in social practices, that was mostly
    neglected in early practice theories, but which is crucial for
    analysing environmental effects of practices."

    A Practice is a configuration of three components: material, meaning and competence.

----

	"SPT doesn't conceptualise how the components 'glue together',
	ie. why certain elements form 'succesful' practices which diffuse
	and are maintained by a substantial part of society while other
	constellations of elements do not succeed."

**** Conceptual framework of social practices

***** Components
      Social practices as weak emergent property of the interaction of individual, compoents etc.
      Only first order convergence considered, not macro-level properties.
      Components linked by individuals when carrying out a practice.

****** Material
       Physical aspects of the performance of a practice. 
****** Meaning
       understandings, beliefs, emotions
****** Competence
       skills and knowledge which are required to perform the practice. 
       eg: driving skills, knowledge of public transport routes.

***** Coherence
     Coherence elaborated by Holtz.
     ( HOLTZ, G. (2012a). Coherence of social practices: the case of
     meat consumption. Unpublished working
     paper. http://www.usf.uos.de/institut/publikationen/forschungsgruppen/rem.html )
     ( HOLTZ, G. (2012b). An agent-based model of social practices. ESSA 2012 Proceedings. )

****** Cognitive consitency
       (alighning behaviours with beliefs / deontics)
       ie: meaning and material must fit.

****** habits over deliberated decisions
       ie: competence and material must fit.

***** social sharing practices

****** adapt meaning to material
       eg: learning about the environmental effects of car use may choose to go by bike

****** adapt competence to material
       eg: introduction of congestion charge in London + public
       transport investment to change transport preferences

****** habituation
       reinforced situation-goal-response connections.  Two different
       modes of behaviour:
******* deliberate choice of material
******* habitual behaviour keeping current material

****** adapt material
       
****** exchange meaning

**** Implementation
     Simple bitstrings.

Hollander and Wu (2011)

    Always with *efficiency*:
	"Research on social control address the challenge of ensuring that
	a system operates *efficiently* while at the same time allowing
	individual agents maintain their freedom"

    Makes the point of following *methodological individualism*. This
    works from the individual on up. Again, consider institutional
    analysis, should we start with individuals?

    Normative agents must:
    1) satisfy the regular notions associated with artificial agents
    2) represent norms in a format that allows them to be reasoned
       over and modified during the lifetime of the agent 
    3) recognise and infer the norms of other agents based on
       observations and interactions while not confusing the norms
       with individual rules and constraints
    4) transmit norms
    5) sanction otheragents who do not comply with known norms as
       required


**** What is a norm
     authoritative standard / principle of right action / typical
     behaviours

     an obligation / permission (boella)

     or a prohibition 

     in legal theory: any behavioural rule dictated by a ruling body
     (verhagen)

     in social sciences: behavioural constraints that are socially
     enforced (bendor and swistak...)

     Common theme: behaviours which *ought* to be displayed by members
     of a group in a given context (boella).

     "One aspect of norms that is frequently left unaddressed in
     artificial systems is their dynamic nature and tendency to change
     over time (neumann 2008)"

     norms can be *sub-optimal*

     norms can be willfully violated. There is *normative choice*

     *COIN* workshops? *EMIL* project for norm innovation
     *COST* action OC0801 working group on norms
     
**** Key Concepts
     a norm is a behavioural rule that is considered valid by the
     majority of the population

     norms are acquired through a social learning process

     norms are social enforced

     norms spread, by active and passive transmission mechanisms

**** Means of representing norms

     
***** In the Social Sciences

      social function of norms: durkheim, parsons, merton
      social impact of norms: economics
      mechanisms leading to norms: complexity science

      in literature: norms address individual action, govern
      interaction between members of a group, dictate responses to
      behaviours observed in others.

      social function in terms of obligations: legal, moral,
      conditional.

      provides dicitions and noramlity.

      social impact: cost provided to / imposed on parties involved in
      a social interaction.
      can impose costs and benefits on individuals or groups.
      
      most recently: interest in norm emergence and creation.
      Two general methods of norm creation: (Boella, Tuomela,
      Verhagen)
      1) *Type 1* explicitly created and enforced by an authority structure 
      2) *Type 2* emerge from regularities in behaviour

      
****** oughtness
       refers to the notion that there are behaviours an agent should
       or should not perform regardless of the possible consequences
       
****** expectation
       refers to the behaviours other agents anticipate when observing
       an agent.
       created when an agent displays behavioural regularity when it
       encounters specific contexts.

**** Norm Life Cycle 
     mentions norm taxonomies and typologies of *finnemore and
     sikkink* and *savarimuthu and cranefield* and *verhagen*.
     
***** Patterns of norm life cycles

      enforcement -> recognition -> obedience -> sanctions
      internalization -> acceptance -> modification -> internalization
      emergence -> transmission -> enformcement -> internalization
      evolution -> creation -> transmission -> enforcement ->
      internalization -> forgetting


**** Categories of the norm life cycle:

***** Creation

***** Transmission

***** recognition

***** enforcement

***** acceptance

***** modification

***** internalization

***** emergence

***** forgetting

***** evolution

*** [[./web_pages/Castelfranchi - Towards Institutional Actions.pdf][Towards Institutional Actions ]]
    Castelfranchi - 2005

    "Institutions are usually conceived as normative systems that
    structure social interactions" Economic models focus on 'the rules
    of the game' of:
    1) in the interest of individual agents
    2) that solve cooperation dilemmas

    Searle adds their conceptual nature into the mix, enabling
    constraint and influence on action capabilities, and normative consequences.

    As with Searle, Castelfranchi "takes the institutional actions as
    pior to the institution objects".

    Triadic Relation of:
    "X, seen as a token of a CT, counts as Y in C"

    "The double empowerment of tools and artifacts"
    
    On Function - "an external goal placed on a system that results in
    a transformation of the structural properties of the system",
    which "modify the shape of the system"

    Finalities of the action set A are:
    1) The subset a that produces effects unintended by, and unknown to the agent.

    Functional aspects are:
    1) Any item in the agent that produces the unintended effect through a casual feedback loop
       
    

**** Commentary
     C / Searle are taking actions as prior to  objects. How does this relate to Graeber / Debt?
     Debt exists before Money, but C uses the example of paying -> money.

     So:
     Paying -> Money
     Debt -> Money
     As:
     Institutional Action -> Institutional Object

     But is this really the case?
     Debt is an institutional concept, rather than an Action. 
     It is closer to Holtz three component distinction. Material, Meaning, Competence.
     So:
     Paying -> Material
     Money -> Artifact? 
     Debt -> Meaning
     ?    -> Competence

     Institutions are resonant groups of reinforcing actions, whose consequences are 
     unintended / non-obvious.

Neumann (2008)

**** Intro
     Mentions link between role theory (ie: Parsons), and norms.
     Action as guided by normative orientation.
     Over the past 20 years there has been criticism of Social Factor
     based explanations. 
     Role theory was based on Durkheim / social factors.
     Rise of *Methodological Individualism* / 'From Factors to Actors'
     (Macy and Willer). This enables investigation into *the feedback
     loop between individual interaction and collective dynamics*

**** The original *homo sociologicus*
     Dahrendorf (1956)
     Meeting a fictional 'Mr Smith' at a cocktail party. What is there
     to find out about him?

     "Mr Smith is an adult male, circa 35 years old. He holds a PhD,
     and is an academic. Since he wears a wedding ring, we know that
     he is married. He lives in a middle-sized town in Germany and is
     a German citizen. Moreover, we discover that he is Protestant and
     that he arrived as a refugee after the 2nd World War in a town
     populated mostly by Catholics. We are told that this situation
     caused some difficulties for him. His is a Lecturer by profession
     and he has two kids. Finally, we learn that he is the third
     chairmen of the local section of a political party, Y, a
     passionate and skilful card player and a similarly passionate
     though not so good driver. This approximates to what his friends
     would tell us. "

     We find out *social facts* about him, without finding out about
     Smith's unique identity. 
     Social Facts -> Social Positions -> Social Roles.
     "Roles are defined by specific attributes, behaviour and social
     relations. Demands of society determine individual behaviour"
     These demands are transmitted to the individual by *norms*.
     "Casting mould" (Durkheim 1895).

     Neumann makes the point that Dahrendorf mentions Smith is
     unlikely to use the cane on his pupils, and driving competence
     would be unlikely to be mentioned now. So *norms change*.

***** Characteristics of Norms
      1) Norms show generality
      2) Norms ahve a subjective element
         Action sets for roles can cover a wide range. 
         Ends of an action have to be determined internally.
      3) Roles are functionally relevant for the reproduction of society.
         Father educates child, Lecturer socialises pupils.


***** Criticism of Classical Role Theory
      1) Norm conception of role theory has a dubious epistemological
         basis.
         Durkheim and Parsons take a functional analysis over causal.
         (See also Gellner and Archer for the *reification of
         society*)
      2) An over socialised picture of man. (Wrong, Homans, and Balog)
         Individual actors are, in Role Theory, treated as social
         automata.


***** Questions for Agent Based Models
      1) Can they provide insights into the normative regulation of
         society? (Focus of contribution)
      2) Do they allow for a causal reconstruction of the mechanisms
         that generate the functional interconnectedness on the social
         level?
      3) What transforms the agents in such a way that they factually
         follow norms? Causal mechanism at work to enable
         internalisation. (Transformation problem)
      4) By what mechanisms in the model can norm-abiding behaviour
         spread to or decay from one agent to another. (Transmission
         problem).

Research traces back to game theory (J: ie: Bicchieri) and AI (ie:
Boella).

***** TODO See Hegselmann for a broad range of moral dynamics.

**** Discussion of Axelrod's evolutionary norms
     Creates a norm and meta-norm game. *Does not rely on rationality*
     only on effectiveness of norms.   
     Variables for meta-norm enforcement include boldness and
     vengefulness.

     Axelrod's model has flexible agents, with observable changes in
     behaviour. Is the starting point for many *normative dynamics*
     investigations.
     Is limited by the applicability to macro-level
     functionality. Decisions are purely based on calculating expected
     utility.
     "An active element of normative orientation in the choice
     relating to the ends of action cannot be found in a game
     theoretic approach". Mirrors Parson's critique of utilitarian
     theories of action. 

     Agents do not act focused on norms. Norms are for interpretation
     of others behaviour. *Transformation is not identical with
     internalisation*.

**** Discussion of Castelfranchi's function of norms in social groups through simulation

     Differentiates between *norms of co-ordination* and *explicit
     prescriptive, directive and command norms*. (J: In this respect
     similar to Bicchieri).

     Simple world of agents, food, smell, attacks, and diminishing
     strength.
     
***** Types of Experiment
      1) Blind Aggression. 
         No means to control aggression, always attack when able.
      2) Strategic aggression.
         Attacks constrained by strategic reasoning.
         Only attack weaker agents.
      3) Normative agents.
         Finder-keeper norm. Multiple possession.
         Agents do not attack agents eating their own possessed food.
         
Units of analysis: *rate of aggression*, *average strength of agents*,
*variance of individual strength*.

"The classical scheme of a functional explanation assumes a social
phenomena P, whereby P has a (functional) effect n for the
society. Individual actors have reasons to practise P independently of
the functional effect n. Moreover there is a feedback loop so that in
the case of a decrease of P, there is a cause for an amplification of
P. Thus, society remains in equilibrium. It is claimed that this state
of affairs is crucial for the 'survival' of the society. "


Norms in this model, unlike Axelrod's, are explicit action routines.

However, transmission, transformation, and internalisation are not
dealt with by Castelfranchi's model. The agents are normative automata
with no personal variation in behaviour.

***** Development of normative agents.
Section *6* of the paper describes a number of game theoretic and
cognitive architectures for normative simulations.
Implementations include *dynamic propensities*, *conditional
strategies*, *dynamic updating*,*decision trees* and *dynamic
thresholds*.

Game theoretic tradition tends to investigate norm dynamics, while AI
tradition tends to investigate functional aspects of norms.
Cognitive agents have become more flexible and applicable to
transformation problems. GT tends to use sanctions, AI uses a variety
of means.

Communication for transformation is more explicitly modelled in AI.

Social learning is implemented in many game theoretic models by
replicator dynamics. This amounts to: more successful types of
behaviour become more frequent, without formalising the mechanism.
