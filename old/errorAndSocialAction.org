* Error and Social Action                                                       :writing:
Machine learning error squared. A representation of the real data to the model,
penalising for outliers. 
When it comes to social action.. it is costly to fully model every
element of every person to know the consequences of your action. 
So aggregate across generalisations for everyone

The error of such action is the difference between resulting
consequences from actual consequences? used to weight expectations?

Versu stress tested choice points... could you run random combinations
of rules and learn instances of combinations?
