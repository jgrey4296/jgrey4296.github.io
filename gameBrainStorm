* Game Ideas

** Social Interactions
*** Apartment Block Simulator
Simulate the interactions between individuals in an apartment block. Could think of JG Ballard's High Rise,
Dredd, The Grand Budapest Hotel.
*** Elevator Simulator
Conversations between individuals in an elevator. Dungeon of the Endless. Mad Men.  The original thought I had
from DotE was the awkward but character building conversations had going from one level to another. Take that
and expand it to have connected conversations, interleaving: character, combat event recollection and
discussion, and vying for social position.

** Lived Experience of Institutions
*** Organisational Promotion Simulator
Shadow of Mordor, Voyager. Gormenghast. The Night Watch

*** Reified Policy Maker
Red Mars.  Democracy connected to the Sims. The King of Dragon Pass.
Seeing how prescribed, allowed, preferred behaviours shift general trends. Racially focused policing,
essentially BLM / Police. Modelling agents knowing/anticipating the likelihood of positive or negative
outcomes from interactions with others. Knowledge of minimum and maximum outcomes. If you know the worst a
situation can get is only so much changes how you behave. Polite to people who, in the rules of the system can
cause negative consequences. Rude to people who can't. Angry at someone going negative when the expectation is
positive.

*** 'Go to the shops, I dare you'
Sliders. Bill Bryson - At Home. John Brunner - Stand on Zanzibar. Alfred Bester.  Rick and Morty take it to
the extreme.
The idea of life being put in situations that are familiar, but which are varied in infinite ways. Some major
(Philip K Dick: TMITHC. Nazi's won the war), to the very minor (There was no Elvis, someone else is 'The
King'). Let Money be shells. Everyone Greets in a strange formal way. Clothing Styles.

*** Public Restroom simulator
Inspired by North Carolina. Simulate Norms related to Bathroom. Parallels with Elevator simulator?  Such as
Design, Occupancy, Organising principle (caste? gender? sexual orientation? organisational position? religion?

*** Newspaper Generator
A Dynamic form of Papers Please' Newspaper. Just front page, but with a headline, a couple of subheadings,
a few quotes, links to particular pages, smaller topics. Exposes, corruption, scandals, celebrities, the front
page is definitional of what is 'newsworthy'. So model that society's representation of it's own
understanding. 

**** Censorship simulator. 
Ministry of Truth in 1984, Censors in Media Positions today. The raw feed of actual actions, and the ability
to choose what, or how much, to let through. 

*** Office Politics
Similar to the Shadow of Mordor simulator. Inter office squabbles. Who likes and dislikes whom. 

** Unrealised Games of Life
*** Accidents in Real Life
The accidents of life. Tripping on the stairs, getting hit by a car, being ill.  Stubbing your toe, not
getting enough sleep. The thousand and one ways in which mood and behaviour is shifted tiny amounts by
unrelated elements.

*** Post Invasion Occupation
Star Trek DS-9. Subjugated populations. 

*** Debt
ie : David Graeber, Debt.
*** Daily Life 
ie: Bill Bryson, Home.
*** Civil Institutions
ie: Terry Pratchett: The Night Watch, Religion, Wizards, The Post Office/Clacks/Bank/Tax
Also African Tribes/Max Gluckman/Elias

** Rational Reconstructions of Existing Games
*** Dungeon of the Endless
Generate a Maze, with a start point (the arriving elevator with crystal), and destination point (the next
elevator). Take moves exploring, randomly adding power. Stream enemies spawned from unpowered rooms to the
crystal. Then transport the crystal to the destination when found. Activate elevator, repeat. 

*** Shadow of Mordor / Redshirt

Hierarchical Organisation, with promotions, conflicts, removal, alliances, and weaknessses.
