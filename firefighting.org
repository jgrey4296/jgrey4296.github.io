* Firefighting as a Game/Sci-fi concept
Mech suits (eg: X-Com) are typically combat focused. 
Also fire is rarely a primary mechanic, but Far-Cry 2 had detailed models of fire spreading.
Power fantasies don't have to be combat oriented. The image of, after having played for hours,
finally obtaining a mech suit built for firefighting, making you able to walk through walls and
ignore fire, when you've been limited the entire game, would give the same power fantasy achievement.

Narratives could easily include arsonists, terrorists, etc.
