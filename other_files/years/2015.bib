 abstract = {All software evolves, and programming languages and programming language tools are no exception. And just like in ordinary software construction, modular implementations can help ease the process of changing a language implementation and its dependent tools. However, the syntactic and semantic dependencies between language features make this a challenging problem. In this paper we detail how programming languages can be implemented in a modular fashion using the Rascal meta-programming language. Rascal supports extensible definition of concrete syntax, abstract syntax and operations on concrete and abstract syntax trees like matching, traversal and transformation. As a result, new language features can be added without having to change existing code. As a case study, we detail our solution of the LDTA'11 Tool Challenge: a modular implementation of Oberon-0, a relatively simple imperative programming language. The approach we sketch can be applied equally well to the implementation of domain-specific languages.},

This “empiricists' insurgency” reinforces a classic literature on the essential role of civilians while challenging older theories about how they affect conflict outcomes. It provides a general framework describing “irregular” insurgencies (where government capacity exceeds rebel capacity), which is analytically cohesive and empirically tested using subnational data from multiple conflicts. The new research provides guidance on intervention design, including governance improvement, development programs, and rules of engagement. The design of interventions matters: Some key evidence comes from measuring the effects of misguided policies. The framework may enable better conceived and implemented interventions, including foreign engagements with and without troop deployment, depending on the type of insurgency and mindful of political limitations. We position these findings in the literature and highlight directions for future research, including legal aspects of countering insurgency.},

 abstract = {As thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, to protest the fatal police shooting of unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown in the summer of 2014, news and commentary on the shooting, the protests, and the militarized response that followed circulated widely through social media networks. Through a theorization of hashtag usage, we discuss how and why social media platforms have become powerful sites for documenting and challenging episodes of police brutality and the misrepresentation of racialized bodies in mainstream media. We show how engaging in " hashtag activism " can forge a shared political temporality, and, additionally, we examine how social media platforms can provide strategic outlets for contesting and reimagining the materiality of racialized bodies. Our analysis combines approaches from linguistic anthropology and social movements research to investigate the semiotics of digital protest and to interrogate both the possibilities and the pitfalls of engaging in " hashtag ethnography. " [digital anthropology, digital activism, social movements, social media, semiotics, race, Twitter, Michael Brown, United States] O n Saturday, August 9, 2014, at 12:03 p.m., an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police offi-cer in Ferguson, Missouri, a small town on the outskirts of St. Louis. Within the hour, a post appeared on the Twitter social media platform stating, " I just saw someone die, " followed by a photograph taken from behind the beams of a small wooden balcony overlooking Canfield Drive, where Michael Brown's lifeless body lay uncov-ered, hands alongside his head, face down on the asphalt. 1 Immediately following the incident, community members assembled to demand an ex-planation for why this unarmed 18-year-old had been seemingly executed while reportedly holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender, plead-ing " don't shoot. " The impromptu gathering soon turned into a sustained protest marked by daily demonstrations and violent confrontations with highly armed local police—all of which were documented in detail across social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Vine. Occurring on the heels of other highly publicized killings of unarmed black men—such as Eric Garner (who died as a result of an illegal choke-hold by New York City police just weeks before the events in Ferguson), Os-car Grant (whose death was emotionally portrayed in the award-winning film Fruitvale Station released just one year prior), and 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (whose 2012 killing sparked national outcry and spurred numer-ous forms of activism)—the death of Michael Brown quickly captured the imagination of thousands across and beyond the United States. 2},

 abstract = {As they involve relationships between interacting individuals and groups, social systems can be described at different levels of resolution. In a number of modeling cases, only one of these levels is explicitly represented. In order to study phenomena where both individual and collective representations are needed, multi-level modeling is a good approach as it explicitly represents these different levels. We propose to consider a multi-level representation from a multi-modeling point of view. This perspective allows explicitly specifying the level's relationships and, therefore, to test hypothesis about interaction between individuals and groups in social systems. We define a framework to better specify the concepts used in multi-level modeling and their relationships. This framework is implemented through the AA4MM meta-model, which benefits from a middleware layer. This meta-model uses the multi-agent paradigm to consider a multi-model as a society of interacting models. We extend this meta-model to consider multi-level modeling, and present a proof of concept of a collective motion example, where we show the advantages of this approach for the study of social phenomena. },

@article{Carter2015,
 abstract = {This paper evaluates the ideological and political origins of a place-based and commercial health promotion effort, the Blue Zones Project (BZP), launched in Iowa in 2011. Through critical discourse analysis, I argue that the BZP does reflect a neoliberalization of public health, but as an "actually existing neoliberalism" it emerges from a specific policy context, including dramatic health sector policy changes due to the national Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare; a media discourse of health crisis for an aging Midwestern population; and an effort to refashion Iowa cities as sites of healthy and active living, to retain and attract a creative class of young entrepreneurs. The BZP employs many well-known mechanisms of neoliberal governance: the public-private partnership; competition among communities for "public" funds; promotion of an apolitical discourse on individual responsibility and ownership of health; decentralizing governance to the "community" level; and marketing, branding, and corporate sponsorship of public projects. The BZP exemplifies the process of "neoliberal governmentality," by which individuals learn to govern themselves and their "life projects" in line with a market-based rationality. However, with its emphasis on "nudging" individuals towards healthy behaviors through small changes in the local environment, the BZP reflects the rise of "libertarian paternalism," a variant of neoliberalism, as a dominant ideology underlying contemporary health promotion efforts.},

@article{Cheong2015,
 abstract = {Games often have storylines. In some games, they are short backstories, serving to set up the action. The first-person shooter game Doom's storyline, about a military science experiment that accidentally opens a portal to hell, is perhaps the canonical example of this kind of story: its main purpose is to set the mood and general theme of the game, and motivate why the player is navigating levels and shooting demons. The level progression and game mechanics have very little to do with the storyline after the game starts. In other games, the storyline structures the progression of the game more pervasively, providing a narrative arc within which the gameplay takes place. The Final Fantasy games are a prominent representative of this style of game storyline. Since the theme of this book is to procedurally generate anything that goes into a game, it will not surprise the reader that we will now look at procedurally gen-erating game storylines. As with procedural generation of game rules, discussed in the previous chapter, procedural generation of storylines is somewhat different from generation of other kinds of procedural content, because storylines are an unusual kind of content. They often intertwine pervasively with gameplay, and their role in a game can depend heavily on a game's genre and mechanics. A common way of integrating a game's storyline with its gameplay, especially in adventure games and role-playing games, is the quest [24, 1]. In a quest, a player is given something to do in the game world, which is usually both motivated by the current state of the storyline, and upon completion will advance it in some way. For example, the player may be tasked with retrieving an item, helping an NPC, defeat-ing a monster, or transporting some goods to another town. Some games (especially RPGs) may be structured as one large quest, broken down into smaller sub-quests that interleave gameplay and story progression. There are several reasons a game designer might want to procedurally generate game stories, beyond the general arguments for procedural content generation dis-cussed in Chapter 1. One reason is that procedurally generated game worlds can lack meaning or motivation to the player, unless they are tied into the game story by procedurally generating relevant parts of story along with the worlds. As Ash-119 120 Yun-Gyung Cheong, Mark O. Riedl, Byung-Chull Bae, Mark J. Nelson more and Nitsche [2] argue, " without context and goals, the generated behaviors, graphics, and game spaces run the danger of becoming insubstantial and tedious " . A second reason is that proceduralizing quests can make them truly playable. Sul-livan et al. [22] note that computer RPGs often have a particularly degenerate form of quest, " generally structured as a list of tasks or milestones " , rather than open-ended goals the player can creatively satisfy. Table-top RPGs have more complex and open-ended quests, since in those games, quests can be dynamically gener-ated and adapted during gameplay by the human game-master, rather than being prewritten. Procedural quest generation gives a way to bring that flexibility back into videogame quests. 7.1 Procedural story generation via planning},

However, existing approaches rely on the assumption of consistent test suites which are always kept up-to-date within the scope of different knowledge base maintenance cycles. In this paper we introduce diagnosis techniques that actively guide stakeholders (knowledge engineers and domain experts) in the process of testing and debugging knowledge bases. These techniques take into account faulty test cases and constraints and recommend diagnoses which are the source of a given inconsistency.},

@article{Frantz2015a,
 abstract = {Agent-based Modelling appears as a promising analytical tool when it comes to a lasting question: in how far did different institutions affect the social and economic outcomes of societies? Taking an incremental step to address this question, we present a refined approach that combines existing institution representations (the structure) with a norm identification process to systematically 'grow' normative understanding from the bottom up without relying on any prior knowledge. The proposed mechanism provides agents with the ability a) to detect complex normative behaviour by developing and differentiating stereotypes of social actors, and b) to generalise behaviour beyond observed social entities, giving agents the ability to develop normative understanding as a potential precursor for predicting newcomers' behaviours. We exemplify this approach using a simulated prototypical trader scenario that is evaluated with respect to behavioural diversity (different compositions of non-/cooperative agents) as well as structural diversity (different types of agents). Using the simulation results, we showcase the explanatory power of the derived normative understanding beyond the interpretation of quantitative results, and finally discuss the generalisability of the proposed approach.},

@article{Gebser2015,
 abstract = {This document provides an introduction to the Answer Set Programming (ASP) tools gringo, clasp, and clingo, developed at the University of Potsdam. The ba- sic idea of ASP is to express a problem in the form of a logic program so that its logical models, called answer sets, provide the solutions to the original problem. The first tool, gringo, is a so-called grounder translating user-provided logic programs (with variables) into equivalent propositional logic programs (without variables). The second tool, clasp, is a so-called solver computing the answer sets of the propositional programs issued by gringo. The third tool, clingo, combines the functionalities of gringo and clasp, and additionally integrates the scripting languages lua and python either through libraries or embedded code. This guide, for one, aims at enabling ASP novices to make use of the aforementioned tools. For another, it provides a reference of the tools' features that ASP adepts might be tempted to exploit. The guide generally refers to gringo and clingo series 4 as well as clasp series 3; full conformity is obtained with gringo 4.5, clingo 4.5 and clasp 3.1. Please make sure that you have corresponding (or later) versions available.},

Our study on innovation practice and culture in the Westland horticulture sector served to explore what information and data from ethnographic analysis could be used in models and how. MAIA, a framework for agent-based model development of social systems, is our starting point for structuring and translating said knowledge into a model.  The data that was collected through an ethnographic process served as input to the agent-based model. We also used the theoretical analysis performed on the data to define outcome variables for the simulation. We conclude by proposing an initial methodology that describes the use of ethnography in modelling.},

 abstract = {Can the general public learn to deal with risk and uncertainty, or do authorities need to steer people's choices in the right direction? Libertarian paternalists argue that results from psychological research show that our reasoning is systematically flawed and that we are hardly educable because our cognitive biases resemble stable visual illusions. For that reason, they maintain, authorities who knowwhat is best for us need to step in and steer our behavior with the help of Bnudges.^ Nudges are nothing new, but justifying them on the basis of a latent irrationality is. In this article, I analyze the scientific evidence presented for such a justification. It suffers from narrow logical norms, that is, a misunderstanding of the nature of rational thinking, and from a confirmation bias,that is, selective reporting of research. These two flaws focus the blame on individuals' minds rather than on external causes, such as industries that spend billions to nudge people into unhealthy behavior. I conclude that the claim that we are hardly educable lacks evidence and forecloses the true alternative to nudging: teaching people to become risk savvy.},

@article{Goldstein2015,
 abstract = {This article presents Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

Reputation is a tool to facilitate trust between entities, as it increases the efficiency and effectiveness of online services and communities. As most entities will not have any direct experience of other entities, they must increasingly come to rely on reputation systems. Such systems allow the prediction who is likely to be trustworthy based on feedback from past transactions. In this paper we introduce a new taxonomy for reputation systems, along with: a reference model for reputation context, a model of reputation systems, a substantial survey, and a comparison of existing reputation research and deployed reputation systems.},

 abstract = {How do individuals resolve conflicts over resources? One way is to share resources, which is possible between known individuals, with the use of sanctions on free riders or by partner selection. Another way is for anonymous individuals to respect the finders' ownership of resources based on asymmetry and avoid conflicts over resources. This study elucidates the conditions under which anonymous individuals share resources with each other irrespective of their asymmetry with regard to resources. High resource values inhibit anonymous individuals from sharing resources; however, small cumulative values and local distributions let anonymous individuals share the resources. Punishment of the richest individuals also supports resource sharing. These conditions may represent resource sharing among anonymous individuals in periods of great disasters and may be the origin of the practice of exchange in prehistoric times. },

Associative browsing represents a common and intuitive set of exploratory strategies in which users step iteratively from familiar to novel bits of information. In this paper, we examine associative browsing as a strategy for bottom-up exploration of large, heterogeneous networks. We present Refinery, an interactive visualization system informed by guidelines for associative browsing drawn from literature on exploratory information-seeking. These guidelines motivate Refinery's query model, which allows users to simply and expressively construct queries using heterogeneous sets of nodes. This system computes degree-of-interest scores for associated content using a fast, random-walk algorithm. Refinery visualizes query nodes within a subgraph of results, providing explanatory context, facilitating serendipitous discovery, and stimulating continued exploration. A study of 12 academic researchers using Refinery to browse publication data demonstrates how the system enables discovery of valuable new content, even within existing areas of expertise.},

 abstract = {Videogames require robust yet flexible methods and vocabularies of critical analysis that appreciate both the textual and embodied pleasures of players. Such analysis cannot start with the players intentions as an autonomous user nor with the videogame as a stable object; rather, it must account for the dynamic interplay between videogame hardware, sensorial perception, and audiovisual and haptic representations. If it is to understand how a particular videogame is engaged as both textual artefact and embodied practice, such analysis must be concerned with not just what the player does with the videogame, but what the videogame does with the player.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis thesis forwards a phenomenology of videogame experience to account for how the player and the videogame incorporate each other in reflexive cycles that mediate presence, attention, perception, and agency. It does not hope to understand videogames either 'as narratives' or 'as games' but as particular amalgamations of existing and nascent media and forms—it hopes to understand videogames as videogames. It explores videogame play as a convergence of eyes-on-screens, ears-at-speakers, and muscles-against-interfaces to interrogate the limits of current game studies approaches that often obscure rich commonalities between videogames and other media forms. Drawing upon phenomenology, posthumanism, and cyborg theory, and embedded in detailed and multifaceted analyses of various videogames on different platforms as played, this thesis develops nuanced understandings of how the player and the videogame come together during play to form particular modes of embodiment through which a videogame work is both interpreted and perceived.},

 abstract = {Norms guide multi-agent systems away from being potentially an- archic towards a coordinated and collaborative society. Institutions provide an explicit, external representation of norms as well as the means to detect violations and other conditions. Each institution can be crafted individually to capture their designers' goals, but this creates a challenge at higher levels of authority in guiding the institutional design to be coordinated with other institutions and not imposing unacceptable limits on agents' rights. We propose to use institutions to govern and to revise institutions, following a princi- ple widely encountered in the social world, where treaties, primary legislation, framework agreements and subsidiarity establish a reg- ulatory space by defining norms on the form of a body of regula- tion. We set out a formal and computational framework, building on the InstAL model and implementation, to construct tiers of in- stitutions, where the norms at each tier are governed by those at the tier above. Thus, agents' behaviour is governed and monitored by a tier-1 institution, whose norms are governed and monitored by a tier-2 institution, etc.. This allows us to check the compliance of an institution with the tier above. Compliance failure generates the necessary examples for automatic norm-revision.},

@article{Klockner2015,
 abstract = {A robust autopilot design methodology using linear parameter varying transformations is presented and applied to a high-agile surface launched air defence missile, which is currently developed by Diehl-BGT-Defence. The lateral dynamics of the tail/thrust vector controlled missile are modelled as a second-order quasi-linear parameter varying (LPV) system. The incidence angle is used as exogenous variable, which is assumed to be estimated during missile flight. Decoupled lateral dynamics are assumed because of the application of a bank-to-turn manoeuvre plane angle control approach. Lateral single channel flight controllers are designed via H∞ -optimal control and $μ$-synthesis with the LPV lateral dynamics, which are extended by uncertain models of control actuating system, time-delay and body bending model. The flight controllers for lateral dynamics are designed at a number of operating points described by the LPV model over the MACH flight envelope. The controllers are implemented using a gain scheduling approach, where an altitude dependent gain loss in the control loop is compensated with the inverse normalised air density. The flight controllers were implemented in the nonlinear simulation environment and tested in extreme flight manoeuvres. All flight controllers showed good damping and acceleration tracking performance and were stable during nonlinear simulations.},

 abstract = {—Good software engineers are essential to the creation of good software. However, most of what we know about software-engineering expertise are vague stereotypes, such as 'excellent communicators' and 'great teammates'. The lack of specificity in our understanding hinders researchers from reasoning about them, employers from identifying them, and young engineers from becoming them. Our understanding also lacks breadth: what are all the distinguishing attributes of great engineers (technical expertise and beyond)? We took a first step in addressing these gaps by interviewing 59 experienced engineers across 13 divisions at Microsoft, uncovering 53 attributes of great engineers. We explain the attributes and examine how the most salient of these impact projects and teams. We discuss implications of this knowledge on research and the hiring and training of engineers.},

To this end, we present a provisional list of 50 commonly used terms in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields that should be avoided, or at most used sparingly and with explicit caveats. We provide corrective information for students, instructors, and researchers regarding these terms, which we organize for expository purposes into five categories: inaccurate or misleading terms, frequently misused terms, ambiguous terms, oxymorons, and pleonasms. For each term, we (a) explain why it is problematic, (b) delineate one or more examples of its misuse, and (c) when pertinent, offer recommendations for preferable terms. By being more judicious in their use of terminology, psychologists and psychiatrists can foster clearer thinking in their students and the field at large regarding mental phenomena.},

Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives.

As anyone who has written an article collaboratively knows, there are numerous ways a manuscript can be written to convey the same general ideas. To aid with this, many scientific writing books and editorials provide advice, often anecdotal, on how to make articles more memorable. Here I ground these suggestions with empirical support from memory research. Specifically, I suggest that researchers consider how to emphasize their work's novelty, strive to describe their work using concrete, easy-to-understand terms, and use caution when attempting to evoke an emotional response in the reader. I also discuss considerations in title selections and conference presentations.},

@book{Manson,
 abstract = {In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people. For decades, we've been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let's be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Mason doesn't sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is--a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let's-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited--"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.},

@article{Martens2015,
 abstract = {Interactive storytelling weaves together deep computational ideas with humanity's rich history of story and play, providing an important context for tools and languages to be built. At the same time, formal speciﬁcation languages offer a palette of representation and inference techniquestypically reserved for the analysis of programming languages and complex deductive systems. This thesis connects problems in the interactive storytelling domain to solutions in formal speciﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we examine narrative from a structural point of view and observe that alternative narrative paths play a complementary role to simultaneous interacting timelines. Linear logic provides the representational tools necessary to investigate this structure,and by extending the correspondence to proofs and proof construction, we ﬁnd a suite of computational possibilities. We present three efforts toward realizing those possibilities: (1) the use of linear logic programming to generate narratives; (2) a new programming language for authoring interactive narratives, games, and simulations; and (3) techniques for stating and proving design-level program properties. We ﬁnd that linear logic programming, enriched with a minimal extension to its logical semantics, enables a wide range of programming idioms and domain encodings. Asevidence,we give ﬁve case studies,including social simulation, combat-based adventure games, and board games. To support reasoning about design correctness, we present techniques for stating and proving program in variants, as well as a decidability proof for automatically checking those invariants for a large fragment of the language. These ﬁndings show that linear logic is a fruitful representation language to serve as the basis for modeling and executing interactive worlds, and they invite future investigations on using proof-theoretic methodologies for creative systems.},

Analyzing lengthy life-narrative interviews of late-midlife adults, we examined the extent to which a particular kind of life story is empirically linked to self-report measures of generativity and other indices of psychosocial adaptation in midlife. The results showed that highly generative adults are significantly more likely than their less-generative counterparts to construe their lives as variations on a prototypical redemption narrative, wherein the story's protagonist (a) enjoys an early advantage in life, (b) exhibits sensitivity to the suffering of other people, (c) develops a clear moral framework, (d) repeatedly transforms negative scenes into positive outcomes, and (e) pursues prosocial goals for the future. The psychological and cultural features of redemptive life stories are considered, as are the problems and potentialities of life-narrative research in psychological science.},

 abstract = {Systems of autonomous and self-interested agents interacting to achieve individual and collective goals may exhibit undesirable or unexpected behaviour if left unconstrained. Norms have been widely proposed as a means of defining and enforcing societal constraints by using the deontic concepts of obligations, permissions and prohibitions to describe what must, may and should not be done, respectively. However, recent efforts to provide norm-enabled agent architectures that guide plan choices suffer from interfering with an agent's reasoning process, and thus limit the agent's autonomy more than is required by the norms alone. In this paper we describe an extension of the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions (BDI) architecture that enables normative reasoning used to help agents choose and customise plans taking norms into account. The paper makes three significant contributions: we provide a formal framework to represent norms compactly and to manage them; we present a formal characterisation of the normative positions induced by norms of an agent's execution within a given time period; and finally, we put forth a mechanism for plan selection and ranking taking into consideration a set of normative restrictions.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the contribution of evidence-based modelling to grounded theory (GT). It is argued that evidence-based modelling provides additional sources to truly arrive at a theory through the inductive process of a Grounded Theory approach. This is shown by two examples. One example concerns the development of software ontologies of criminal organisations. The other example is a simulation model of escalation of ethno-nationalist conflicts. The first example concerns early to middle stages of the research process. The development of an ontology provides a tool for the process of theoretical coding in a GT approach. The second example shows stylised facts resulting from a simulation model of the escalation of ethno-nationalist conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. These reveal mechanisms of nationalist radicalisation. This provides additional credibility for the claim that evidence-based modelling assists to inductively generate a theory in a GT approach.},

@article{Perez-Truglia2015,
 abstract = {In 2001, Norwegian tax records became easily accessible online, allowing individuals to observe the incomes of others. Because of self-image and social-image concerns, higher income transparency can increase the differences in well-being between rich and poor. We test this hypothesis using survey data from 1985-2013. We identify the causal effect of income transparency on subjective well-being by using differences-in-differences, triple-differences, and event-study analyses. We find that higher income transparency increased the happiness gap between rich and poor by 29% and the life satisfaction gap by 21%. Additionally, higher income transparency corrected misperceptions about the income distribution and changed preferences for redistribution. Last, we use the estimates for back-of-the-envelope calculations of the value of self-image and social-image.},

@article{Pinciroli2015,
 abstract = {We present Buzz, a novel programming language for heterogeneous robot swarms. Buzz advocates a compositional approach, offering primitives to define swarm behaviors both from the perspective of the single robot and of the overall swarm. Single-robot primitives include robot-specific instructions and manipulation of neighborhood data. Swarm-based primitives allow for the dynamic management of robot teams, and for sharing information globally across the swarm. Self-organization stems from the completely decentralized mechanisms upon which the Buzz run-time platform is based. The language can be extended to add new primitives (thus supporting heterogeneous robot swarms), and its run-time platform is designed to be laid on top of other frameworks, such as Robot Operating System. We showcase the capabilities of Buzz by providing code examples, and analyze scalability and robustness of the run-time platform through realistic simulated experiments with representative swarm algorithms.},

@article{Pitt2015,
 abstract = {Many open networks, distributed computing systems, and infrastructure management systems face a common problem: how to distribute a collectivised set of resources amongst a set of autonomous agents of heterogenous provenance. One approach is for the agents themselves to self-organise the allocation of resources with respect to a set of agreed conventional rules; but given an allocation scheme which maps resources to those agents and a set of rules for determining that allocation scheme, some natural questions arise-Is this allocation fair? Is the allocation method effective? Is it efficient? Are the decision makers accountable? In this paper, we argue that some answers to these questions can be found in the formal characterisation of different aspects of 'justice' and that these different aspects need a principled operationalisation as policies for system management. We present a formal model and some experimental results, concluding that the different aspects are all inter-connected and that what is required is a comprehensive research programme in computational justice. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

@article{polhill2015extracting,
 abstract = {Using OWL ontologies to represent the state and structure of a simulation at any one time has been argued to improve the transparency of a social simulation, on the basis that this information is then not embedded in the source code of the model, or in the computer's memory at run-time. Should transparency of such a form be desirable, it would be preferable to enable it by extracting the information automatically from a running model. However, semantic differences between traditional object-oriented programming languages and description logics pose an obstacle to this. This paper presents arguments that Netlogo does not have the same semantic challenges to automated ontology extraction, and describes an extension to Netlogo (5.0) using the OWL-API (3.1.0) that extracts state and structure ontologies from an existing Netlogo model. The extension is freely available from https://github.com/garypolhill/netlogo-owl.},

@article{Quattrone2015,
 abstract = {This paper questions a key assumption in the organizations literature that the dynamism of institutional logics and practice variations is the result of rivalry among logics and actors, of tensions and institutional shifts, and of the agency of institutional entrepreneurs. This study examines in rich historical detail the development of accounting in the Jesuit Order, illustrating how Jesuit accounting started from a rationality that did not presuppose an external ordering principle; instead, Jesuit rationality was unfolding--founded in continuous interrogations informed by common, purposeful procedural logics stemming from rhetorical practices used to classify, recall, and invent knowledge. I examine this concept of unfolding rationality in two areas of Jesuit practices: spiritual self-accountability and administrative accounting and recordkeeping. In this Jesuit rationality, the relationships between means and ends, and how and why behaviors take place, were not anchored permanently in a substantive logic. Instead, procedural logics left individual Jesuits and the community to imagine modes of action in the specific social and organizational contexts in which their missions operated. Jesuit rationality was thus unfolding, a persistent and recursive mode of governing social behavior and searching for organizational order that generated large-scale administrative routines and institutional dynamism while never fully achieving that order. The analysis brings into question our understanding of the historical and institutional genealogies of modern rationality and its taken-for-granted link with Protestant ethics.},

@article{Rauwolf2015,
 abstract = {Individuals often judge others based on third-party gossip, rather than their own experience, despite the fact that gossip is error-prone. Rather than judging others on their merits, even when such knowledge is free, we judge based on the opinions of third parties. Here we seek to understand this observation in the context of the evolution of cooperation. If individuals are being judged on noisy social reputations rather than on merit, then agents might exploit this, eroding the sustainability of cooperation. We employ a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Donation game, which has been used to simulate the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity. First, we validate the proposition that adding homophily (the propensity to interact with others of similar beliefs) into a society increases the sustainability of cooperation. However, this creates an evolutionary conflict between the accurate signalling of ingroup status versus the veridical report of the behaviour of other agents. We find that conditions exist where signalling ingroup status outweighs honesty as the best method to ultimately spread cooperation.},

@misc{Rentschler,
 abstract = {Over the past decade, video games have been commercially substantiated as a mass medium, addressing an increasingly broad audience. With the sudden explosion of mobile platforms and social network games, hundreds of millions of users now play video games. Yet, it seems few industry developers pay heed to the impact video games have on the day-to-day lives of their players, as they continue to design games primarily for economic profit. As both media and technology, however, video games are imbued with ethical, political, and social values expressed through the various components of the games themselves. In this dissertation, I seek to examine how these human values are expressed in video games by focusing on four layers of the video game: rules, fiction, platform, and kinesthetic. By negotiating how each of these layers is expressive of human values, I explain how video games are capable of uniquely communicating ethics and politics through the intricacies of their complex design, including the more commonly analyzed sites of the visual, aural, and narrative, as well as rule sets, code, and input mechanisms.

@article{revay2015,
 abstract = {The different ways individuals socialize with others affect the conditions under which social norms are able to emerge. In this work an agent-based model of cooperation in a population of adaptive agents is presented. The model has the ability to implement a multitude of network topologies. The agents possess strategies represented by boldness and vengefulness values in the spirit of Axelrod's (1986) norms game. However, unlike in the norms game, the simulations abandon the evolutionary approach and  only follow a single-generation of agents who are nevertheless able to adapt their strategies based on changes in their environment. The model is analyzed for potential emergence or collapse of norms under different network and neighborhood configurations as well as different vigilance levels in the agent population. In doing so the model is found able to exhibit interesting emergent behavior suggesting potential for norm establishment even without the use of so-called metanorms. Although the model shows that the success of the norm is dependent on the neighborhood size and the vigilance of the agent population, the likelihood of norm collapse is not monotonically related to decreases in vigilance.},

@article{Roberts2015,
 abstract = {Communication systems are exposed to two different pressures: a pressure for transmission efficiency, such that messages are simple to produce and perceive, and a pressure for referential efficiency, such that messages are easy to understand with their intended meaning. A solution to the first pressure is combinatoriality - the recombination of a few basic meaningless forms to express an infinite number of meanings. A solution to the second is iconicity - the use of forms that resemble what they refer to. These two solutions appear to be incompatible with each other, as iconic forms are ill-suited for use as meaningless combinatorial units. Furthermore, in the early stages of a communication system, when basic referential forms are in the process of being established, the pressure for referential efficiency is likely to be particularly strong, which may lead it to trump the pressure for transmission efficiency. This means that, where iconicity is available as a strategy, it is likely to impede the emergence of combinatoriality. Although this hypothesis seems consistent with some observations of natural language, it was unclear until recently how it could be soundly tested. This has changed thanks to the development of a line of research, known as Experimental Semiotics, in which participants construct novel communication systems in the laboratory using an unfamiliar medium. We conducted an Experimental Semiotic study in which we manipulated the opportunity for iconicity by varying the kind of referents to be communicated, while keeping the communication medium constant. We then measured the combinatoriality and transmission efficiency of the communication systems. We found that, where iconicity was available, it provided scaffolding for the construction of communication systems and was overwhelmingly adopted. Where it was not available, however, the resulting communication systems were more combinatorial and their forms more efficient to produce. This study enriches our understanding of the fundamental design principles of human communication and contributes tools to enrich it further.},

In this paper I examine the potential of three kinds of plot for active user participation: the epic plot, which focuses on the struggle of the individual to survive in a hostile world, the dramatic plot, which deals with the evolution of a network of human relations, and the epistemic plot, which is propelled by the desire to solve a mystery. I distinguish two basic types of immersionludic and narrative, the latter subdivided into spatial, temporal and emotional variants, and I discuss the ability of the three kinds of plot to generate these various forms of immersion.},

@article{Shaker2015,
 abstract = {A dungeon, in the real world, is a cold, dark and dreadful place where prisoners are kept. A dungeon, in a computer game, is a labyrinthine environment where ad-venturers enter at one point, collect treasures, evade or slay monsters, rescue noble people, fall into traps and ultimately exit at another point. This conception of dun-geons probably originated with the roleplaying board game Dungeons and Drag-ons, and has been a key feature of almost every computer role playing game (RPG), including genre-defining games such as the Legend of Zelda series and the Final Fantasy series, and recent megahits such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Of par-ticular note is the " roguelike " genre of games which, following the original Rogue from 1980, features procedural runtime dungeon generation; the Diablo series is a high-profile series of games in this tradition. Because of this close relationship with such successful games, and also due to the unique control challenges in their design, dungeons are a particularly active and attractive PCG subject. For the purposes of this chapter, we define adventure and RPG dungeon levels as labyrinthic environments, consisting mostly of inter-related challenges, rewards and puzzles, tightly paced in time and space to offer highly structured gameplay progressions [13]. An aspect which sets dungeons apart from other types of levels is a sophisticated notion of gameplay pacing and progression: although dungeon levels are open for free player exploration (more than e.g. platform levels), this exploration has a tight bond with the progression of challenges, rewards and puz-zles, as intended by game designers. In contrast with e.g. platform levels or race tracks, dungeon levels encourage free exploration while keeping strict control over gameplay experience, progression and pacing (unlike open worlds, where the player is more independent). For example, players may freely choose their own dungeon path among different possible ones, but never encounter challenges that are impos-sible for their current skill level (since the space to back track is not as open as, for example, a sandbox city). Designing dungeons is thus a sophisticated exercise of emerging a complex game space from predetermined desired gameplay, rather than the other way around. 31 32 Noor Shaker, Antonios Liapis, Julian Togelius, Ricardo Lopes, and Rafael Bidarra In most adventure games and RPGs, dungeons structurally consist of several rooms connected by hallways. While originally the term 'dungeon' refers to a labyrinth of prison cells, in games it may also refer to caves, caverns, or human-made structures. Beyond geometry and topology, dungeons include non-player-characters (e.g. monsters to slay, princesses to save), decorations (typically fantasy-based) and objects (e.g. treasures to loot). Procedural generation of dungeons refers to the generation of the topology, ge-ometry and gameplay-related objects of this type of levels. A typical dungeon gen-eration method consists of three elements: 1. A representational model: an abstract, simplified representation of a dungeon, providing a simple overview of the final dungeon structure. 2. A method for constructing that representational model. 3. A method for creating the actual geometry of a dungeon from its representational model.},

 abstract = {In recent decades, financialization has significantly restructured American capitalism. Social scientists have offered several accounts to explain financial markets' ascen-dance, but this work often portrays financialization as a totalizing force and is conducted within divergent theoretical paradigms—political economy and neo-institutionalism— with few attempts to bridge these differences. Accordingly, we risk talking past each other while failing to identify where financialization occurs. I address these issues with a unique panel data set, panel analysis and with a focus on identifying the meso-level determinants of financialization. I do so with a substantively important industry that exemplifies the global, flexible and competitive characteristics of neo-liberal capitalism. I argue that the propensity to financialize rests significantly upon firms' productive roles, meaning we cannot understand financialization without under-standing production—global production networks in particular. This is also a call for researchers to explore financialization's multifaceted character and to develop a more analytically rigorous research agenda.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a model for designing games around Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-based games put AI in the foreground of the player experience rather than in a supporting role as is often the case in many commercial games. We analyze the use of AI in a number of existing games and identify design patterns for AI in games. We propose a generative ideation technique to combine a design pattern with an AI technique or capacity to make new AI-based games. Finally, we demonstrate this technique through two examples of AI-based game prototypes created using these patterns.},

It examines Searle's work in relation to current issues of central significance, including internalism versus externalism about mental and linguistic content, truth-conditional versus non-truth-conditional conceptions of content, the relative priorities of thought and language in the explanation of intentionality, the status of the distinction between force and sense in the theory of meaning, the issue of meaning scepticism in relation to rule-following, and the proper characterization of 'what is said' in relation to the semantics/pragmatics distinction. Written by a distinguished team of contemporary philosophers, and prefaced by an illuminating essay by Searle, the volume aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of Searle's work in philosophy of language, and to suggest innovative approaches to fundamental questions in that area.},

While static graph visualizations are often divided into node-link and matrix representations, we identify the representation of time as the major distinguishing feature for dynamic graph visualizations: either graphs are represented as animated diagrams or as static charts based on a timeline. Evaluations of animated approaches focus on dynamic stability for preserving the viewer's mental map or, in general, compare animated diagrams to timeline-based ones.

 abstract = {Conversational modeling is an important task in natural language understanding and machine intelligence. Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to converse well. It is able extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.},

 abstract = {Two innovations are enhancing programming languages' capabilities. First, modularity lets you combine independently developed languages without changing their respective definitions. A language is no longer a fixed quantity; you can extend it with domain-specific constructs as needed. Second, projectional editing lets you build editors and IDEs that don't require parsers. Such editors and IDEs support a range of tightly integrated notations, including textual, symbolic, tabular, and graphical notations. In addition, by avoiding parsers, they avoid grammar composition's well-known limitations. Three examples illustrate how these two innovations affect programming-language design. A set of modular extensions of C for embedded programming enables efficient code generation and formal analysis. A language for requirements engineering flexibly combines structured and unstructured (prose) data. Finally, a language for defining insurance rules uses mathematical notation. These examples all rely on the open source JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System) language workbench. This article is part of a special issue on Software Architecture. © 1984-2012 IEEE.},

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies. Investigators can quickly make univariate scatterplots for small sample size studies using our Excel templates.},

There is always one more track to follow, one more mirage to explore. — Rosita Forbes Sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze. In this chapter you will learn how to modify and extend an agent-based model. We will do this by taking several classic models, examining how they work, and then discussing how to change and extend these models. Sometimes the modified models explore alterna-tive scenarios, variations on the original model. Other times, the modifications may lead to models of very different phenomena. During these explorations it is important to pay attention to four characteristic features of agent-based modeling: 1. Simple rules can be used to generate complex phenomena Many of the models that we will look into have very simple rules that do not require complex mathematical formulas or a deep understanding of the knowledge domain that they are attempting to model. Nonetheless, they are able to reproduce complex phe-nomena that are observed in the real world. For instance, a model of fire spread may have only a simple rule to describe fire spread from one tree to another, but it still may have interesting things to say about how likely a fire is to spread across an entire forest. 3},

Eliot (from " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, " 1920) What I cannot create, I do not understand. — Richard Feynman (as seen on his blackboard and attributed by Hawking, 2001) In the previous two chapters, we had our first taste of working with agent-based modeling code, writing simple models, examining model code, and extending it. One can accomplish a lot by working with publicly available models and modifying and extending them. Even in the most advanced ABM models one can often find code snippets borrowed from other models. However, eventually you will want to design and build your own model from the ground up. This chapter is intended to take you from the first step of devising a question or area you want to explore, all the way through designing, and building your model, to refining your question and revising your model, to analyzing your results and answering your question. This sequence is presented here in linear order, but in reality these steps fold back on each other and are part of an iterative exploration and refinement of the model and motivating question. We will explore all of this within the context of a particular model, but at the same time we will discuss general issues related to model authoring and model design. To facilitate this process, this chapter is broken into three main sections: (1) Designing your model will take you through the process of determining what elements to include in your model, (2) Building your model will demonstrate how to take a conceptual model and create a com-putational object, and (3) Examining your model will address how to run your model, create some results, and analyze those results to provide a useful answer to your motivating question. 4 158 Chapter 4 Throughout this chapter we will be designing, building, and examining a simple model of an ecological system. The basic question that we will be addressing is: " How do the population levels of two habitat-sharing animal species change over time? " For our pur-poses in this chapter, we will call this model the Wolf Sheep Simple model. Though we will discuss this model in the context of two biological species, the model could be generalized to other situations such as companies competing for consumers, electoral parties competing for votes, or viruses evolving in a computer system. More important, the components that we will be developing in this model are basic components utilized in most ABMs.},

 abstract = {Now that we have had some experience with extending agent-based models and building ABMs on our own, we can take a step back and more comprehensively examine the indi-vidual components of such models. This gives us a chance to reflect on some issues that arise when implementing new ABMs. We begin this chapter by laying out an overview of the components of an ABM; in some cases, this will be a review of features discussed in previous chapters. We will then discuss each of the components in turn. At the end of the chapter, we will discuss how all of these components come together to create a full set of tools for the construction of ABMs. Overview As we have described in chapter 1, the raison d ' ê tre of agent-based modeling is the idea that complex systems can be productively modeled and explained by creating agents and environment, describing their behavior through agent rules, and specifying agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. This description of an ABM is itself a simplified picture, a model of agent-based modeling, if you will. The main components of any ABM are agents , environment , and interactions. Agents are the basic ontological units of the model, while the environment is the world in which the agent lives. The distinction between agents and environment can be fluid, as the environment can some-times be modeled as agents. Interactions can occur either between agents or between},

 abstract = {The world can be resolved into digital bits, with each bit made of smaller bits. — Ed Fredkin It ' s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc. The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. — Marvin Minsky Many different fields have contributed ideas and methods to ABM. In this appendix, we will focus on the key antecedents of ABM technologies from computer science and associated computational fields. Besides the computational fields, we note that there have also been strong contributions from biology, physics, engineering, and social science. In biology, these contributions came largely from ecology and the independent development of Individual-Based Model-ing alongside ABM (DeAngelis & Gross, 1992). Individual-based modeling foregrounds the role of individual animal or plant behavior in an ecosystem, as opposed to working with population-level variables (DeAngelis & Mooij, 2005). Moreover, like ABM, IBM models are often placed within particular landscapes or environments, and IBM modelers focus on how landscapes can greatly affect the results of a model (Grimm & Railsback, 2005). Much of IBM methodology has become incorporated into ABM work. In physics, the Ising models were used to describe magnetics and showed that very simple models could produce phase transition. These models were also precursors of cel-lular automata. As described in chapter 3, physicist Per Bak created the classic Sandpile model, which Bak used to illustrate the concept of self-organizing criticality (SOC). He went on to apply physics-based methods to complex phenomena across many content domains (such as the Fire model in chapter 3 and various stock market models) and showed the relationship of power laws to SOC. In engineering, process engineering and cybernetics, among other areas of research, contributed to ABM ' s development. In process engineering, the goal is to design an optimal output given low-level behaviors, which can be thought of as a similar framework to ABM, 432 Appendix but with a different goal. As such, some of the tools and methods of process engineering are also useful in the context of ABM. The field of cybernetics branched off from process and control engineering, focusing on general properties of feedback in systems. This led to notions of system phase shifts, that is, areas of parameter-space where small changes can have disproportionate consequences (Wiener, 1961). In a similar vein, as engineering models became more complex, they needed to deal with stochasticity, which led to the techniques of Monte Carlo simulation (Metropolis & Ulam, 1949), wherein models are run repeatedly in order to understand its range of outputs or search for an optimal output. As with process and cybernetic engineers, social scientists came to the realization that social organizations ' complexities were not sufficiently captured by available modeling tools. As a result, social scientists started using algorithmic and computational models to describe social phenomena. These models could be reasoned about and falsifiable predic-tions could be made from them, thus allowing the models to be tested. This provided social scientists with a method of comparing empirical data to predicted data akin to that of natural scientists (Lave & March, 1975). Nash ' s (1950) game theory models were some of the earliest attempts to capture human behavior in mathematical equations. Most of these initial social science models used aggregate data averaged across individuals. For instance, the famous Club of Rome model made very simple assumptions about how world population would increase and how resources would be consumed (Meadows, 1972). These efforts gave rise over time to Systems Dynamic Modeling (SDM; Forrester, 1961), which proposed creating models using stocks (the quantities of goods, entities, or objects in particular locations) and flows (the rates of increase or decrease in these stocks). SDM modelers made important contributions to complex systems, but because the elements in System Dynamics models were mass quantities, a logical step was to shift down a level, modeling the individuals that make up the mass quantity. Thus, for modelers interested in SDM, agent-based modeling was a natural progression that enabled a deeper examination of the behavior of heterogeneous individuals. In fact, partly because of this need for social science to understand individual behavior in an increasingly rich framework, some of the earliest agent-based models arose in the social sciences. Schelling ' s model of segregation (discussed in chapter 3) is considered by many to be one of the first agent-based models ever devised, even though it was carried out manually using a checkerboard and coins (Schelling, 1971). Schelling ' s book Micromotives and Macrobehavior (1978) demon-strated how individual level actions could give rise to surprising social patterns. His Segregation model showed that housing segregation would occur even if no individual wants it, as long as people have a preference not be in an extreme minority in their neighborhood. In the last decade, we have witnessed tremendous growth in the field of network theory and the incorporation of support for networks as a core element of agent-based modeling. This work was pioneered by the mathematician Euler in the 1800s in solving the problem of the seven bridges of Konigsberg (see Newman, 2010). In the 1950s and early ' 60s,},

 abstract = {Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. — Proverbs 6:6 Ants The ant opens her eyes and looks around. There are many of her siblings nearby, but there is no food. The ant is hungry, so she heads out from the ant colony and starts to wander around. She sniffs a little to the left and a little to the right, and still she cannot smell any food. So she keeps wandering. She passes by several of her sisters, but they do not interest her right now; she has food on her mind. She keeps wandering. Sniff! Sniff! Mmmm łdots good! She gets a whiff of some of that delightful pheromone stuff. She heads in the direc-tion of the strongest pheromone scent; in the past there has been food at the end of that trail. Sure enough, as the ant proceeds along the trail, she arrives at some delicious food. She grabs some food and heads back to the colony, making sure to drop some pheromone along the way. On the way back, she runs into many of her sisters, each sniffing her way along pheromone trails, repeating the same process they will carry out all day. What we have just fancifully described is an ant foraging for food. The opening para-graph of this section is in itself a model of ant behavior. By a model , we mean an abstracted description of a process, object, or event. Models can take many distinct forms. However, certain forms of models are easier to manipulate than other forms. The textual description in our first paragraph cannot easily be manipulated to answer questions about the ant colony ' s behavior — for example, what would we see if all the ants in the colony followed the behavior we described? It is difficult to extrapolate from the textual description of one ant to a description of an ant colony. The textual model is not sufficiently generative to answer such questions. It is a fixed description — always " behaving " the same, thus not bestowing any insight into the range of variation in behaviors. And it is not combinato-rial — we cannot use the description to understand the interaction of the ants with each other or with the environment. 1 22 Chapter 1 One way to make the preceding model more generalizable and gain insight into the behavior of an ant colony would be to implement the model in a computational form. A computational model is a model that takes certain input values, manipulates those inputs in an algorithmic way, and generates outputs. In computational form, it would be easy to run the " Ants " model with large numbers of ants and to observe the model ' s outputs given many possible different inputs. We use the term model implementation to refer to this process of transforming a textual model 1 into a working computational simulation (written in some form of computer " code "). Besides textual models, there are other forms of con-ceptual models that describe processes, objects, or events but are not computational; conceptual models can also be diagrammatic or pictorial. This description lends itself particularly well to being implemented, since it results from a particular standpoint, that of an individual ant, or ant agent . By the word agent , we mean an autonomous individual element of a computer simulation. These individual elements have properties, states, and behaviors. The ant is an agent. It has properties such as its appearance and its rate of movement. It has characteristic behaviors such as moving, sniffing, picking up food, and dropping pheromone. It has states such as whether or not it is carrying food (a binary state) and whether it can sense how much pheromone is in the environment around it (a multi-valued state). Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling paradigm that enables us to describe how any agent will behave. 2 The methodology of ABM encodes the behavior of individual agents in simple rules so that we can observe the results of these agents ' interactions. This technique can be used to model and describe a wide variety of processes, phenomena, and situations, but it is most useful when describing these phenomena as complex systems . Our aim in this textbook is to facilitate your creating, modifying, and analyzing the outputs of agent-based models. We begin by describing the genesis of the ant foraging conceptual model and how it was implemented as an agent-based model.},

 abstract = {This paper attempts to give a high-level overview 4of the field of artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: (1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; (2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and (3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields.},
