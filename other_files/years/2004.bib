@article{Andretta,
 abstract = {The central theme of this paper is the implementation of Information Literacy provision for a Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) accredited M.A. programme. As the term “Information Literacy” covers a number of definitions and information practices the paper relates to several of the conference's key topics. For example, the predominant reliance on electronic provision addresses the issues of supporting e- learning and evaluating the effectiveness of Information and Communication Technologies. In addition, the efforts made to ensure that the MA addresses the information practitioners' Continuous Professional Development needs relates to the implementation of life-long learning by applying the heuristic strategy promoted by the IL approach. In line with the literature and the recommendations of information professional bodies such as Society of College National and University Libraries (SCONUL) and the American Library Association (ALA), Information Literacy is seen as the foundation of independent learning needed to support academic and professional development practices. IL integration at postgraduate level is illustrated through the delivery of the Applied Information Research module and the use of the knowledge-spiral approach to encourage students to engage fully with the processes of independent learning and reflective practices.},

Within the struc- ture of normative multiagent systems we distinguish between regulative norms that describe obligations, prohibitions and permissions, and constitutive norms that regulate the creation of institutional facts as well as the modification of the norma- tive system itself. Using the metaphor of normative systems as agents, we attribute mental attitudes to the normative sys- tem. In particular, we formalize regulative norms as goals of the normative system, and constitutive norms as beliefs of the normative system. Agents reason about norm creation using recursive modelling.

Locke is a key figure in late chapters, as a result of his importance both in the development of British and Irish philosophy and because of his seminal influence in the Enlightenment as a whole. British Philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment includes discussion of Scottish Enlightenment and its influence on the German Aufklarung, and consequently on Kant. French thought, which in turn affected the late radical Enlightenment, especially Bentham, is also considered here.This survey brings together clear, authoritative chapters from leading experts and provides a scholarly introduction to this period in the history of philosophy.

@book{C.Solomon2004,
 abstract = {The turn of the nineteenth century marked a rich and exciting explosion of philosophical energy and talent. The enormity of the revolution set off in philosophy by Immanuel Kant was comparable, by Kant's own estimation, with the Copernican Revolution that ended the middle ages. The movement he set in motion, the fast-moving and often cantankerous dialectic of “German Idealism,” inspired some of the most creative philosophers in modern times: including G.W.F.Hegel and Arthur Schopenhauer as well as those who reacted against them—Marx and Kierkegaard, for example. This volume traces the emergence of German Idealism from Kant and his predecessors through the first half of the nineteenth century, ending with the “irrationalism” of Kierkegaard. Each chapter has been written by a distinguished scholar in the field, and contributors include Lewis White Beck (on the German background), Daniel Bonevac, Don Becker, Patrick Gardiner (on Kant), Daniel Breazeale (on Fichte and Schelling), Robert C.Solomon, Willem deVries and Leo Rauch (on Hegel), Kathleen M.Higgins (on Schopenhauer), Robert Nola (on the Young Hegelians, including Marx) and Judith Butler (on Kierkegaard). The Age of German Idealism provides a broad, scholarly introduction to the period for students of philosophy and related disciplines, as well as some original interpretations of these authors. It includes a glossary of technical terms and a chronological table of philosophical, scientific and other important cultural events. Robert C.Solomon is Quincey Lee Centennial Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin. Kathleen M.Higgins is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin.},

We extrapolate where the industry is going and what future synergies it is likely to contribute. We focus on behavior generation and other accomplishments that are relevant for training applications and especially for non-programmer authorship of content for training applications. We will argue that the gaming industrys modeling capabilities are currently of little theoretical interest but that pragmatically, the current accomplishments of the gaming industry can have a substantial positive impact on training and modeling and that this impact will increase over the next few years.},

 abstract = {Program transformations in terms of abstract syntax trees compromise referential integrity by introducing variable capture. Variable capture occurs when in the generated program a variable declaration accidentally shadows the intended target of a variable reference. Existing transformation systems either do not guarantee the avoidance of variable capture or impair the implementation of transformations. We present an algorithm called name-fix that automatically eliminates variable capture from a generated program by systematically renaming variables. name-fix is guided by a graph representation of the binding structure of a program, and requires name-resolution algorithms for the source language and the target language of a transformation. name-fix is generic and works for arbitrary transformations in any transformation system that supports origin tracking for names. We verify the correctness of name-fix and identify an interesting class of transformations for which name-fix provides hygiene. We demonstrate the applicability of name-fix for implementing capture-avoiding substitution, inlining, lambda lifting, and compilers for two domain-specific languages.},

Reasons for the plethora of formal systems are discussed as well as how formal systems and agent-based social simulation can work together. As an example a formal system for describing social relationships and interactions in a multi-agent system is presented and how this could benefit from agent-based social simulation as well as make a contribution is discussed. },

Drawing on perspectives from cultural studies, postmodern theory, critical theory, and interactionist sociology, and on ethnographic methodologies and media/textual analysis, this orientation highlights issues of image, meaning, and representation in the interplay of crime and crime control. Specifically, cultural criminology investigates the stylized frameworks and experiential dynamics of illicit subcultures; the symbolic criminalization of popular culture forms; and the mediated construction of crime and crime control issues. In addition, emerging areas of inquiry within cultural criminology include the development of situated media and situated audiences for crime; the media and culture of policing; the links between crime, crime control, and cultural space; and the collectively embodied emotions that shape the meaning of crime.},

In an attempt to gain better understanding of data, fi elds such as information visualization, data mining and graphic design are employed, each solving an isolated part of the specifi c problem, but failing in a broader sense: there are too many unsolved problems in the visualization of complex data. As a solution, this dissertation proposes that the individual fi elds be brought together as part of a singular process titled Computational Information Design. This dissertation fi rst examines the individual pedagogies of design, information, and computation with a focus on how they support one another as parts of a combined methodology for the exploration, analysis, and representation of complex data. Next, in order to make the process accessible to a wider audience, a tool is introduced to simplify the computational process for beginners, and can be used as a sketch- ing platform by more advanced users. Finally, a series of examples show how the methodology and tool can be used to address a range of data problems, in particular, the human genome.},

This article reviews recent evidence suggesting that psychological essentialism is an early cognitive bias. Young children look beyond the obvious in many converging ways: when learning words, generalizing knowledge to new category members, reasoning about the insides of things, contemplating the role of nature versus nurture, and constructing causal explanations. These findings argue against the standard view of children as concrete thinkers, instead claiming that children have an early tendency to search for hidden, non-obvious features.},

Its rigorous approach uses category theory to achieve independence from any particular choice of representation, and institutions to achieve independence from any particular choice of logic. Corelations and colimits provide a general formalization of information integration, and Grothendieck constructions extend this to several kinds of heterogeneity.

@book{HandlerMiller2004,
 abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$α$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Chapter 1: Introduction to Neural Networks (Wednesday, November 16, 2005) Computers can perform many operations considerably faster than a human being. Yet there are many tasks where the computer falls considerably short of its human counterpart. There are numerous examples of this.

 abstract = {This paper describes a type system for extensible records and variants with first-class labels; labels are polymorphic and can be passed as arguments. This in-creases the expressiveness of conventional record calculi significantly, and we show how we can encode intersec-tion types, closed-world overloading, type case, label selective calculi, and first-class messages. We formally motivate the need for row equality predicates to express type constraints in the presence of polymorphic labels. This naturally leads to an orthogonal treatment of unre-stricted row polymorphism that can be used to express first-class patterns. Based on the theory of qualified types, we present an effective type inference algorithm and efficient compila-tion method. The type inference algorithm, including the discussed extensions, is fully implemented in the experimental Morrow compiler.},

 abstract = {Several innovative software applications such as those required by ambient intelligence, the semantic grid, e-commerce and e-marketing, can be viewed as open soci- eties of heterogeneous and self-interested agents in which social order is achieved through norms. For agents to par- ticipate in these kinds of societies, it is enough that they are able to represent and fulfill norms, and to recog- nise the authority of certain agents. However, to volun- tarily be part of a society or to voluntarily leave it, other characteristics of agents are needed. To find these char- acteristics we observe that on the one hand, autonomous agents have their own goals and, sometimes, they act on be- half of others whose goals must be satisfied. On the other, we observe that by being members, agents must com- ply with some norms that can be in clear conflict with their goals. Consequently, agents must evaluate the pos- itive or negative effects of norms on their goals before making a decision concerning their social behaviour. Pro- viding a model of autonomous agents that make this kind of norm reasoning is the aim of this paper},

 abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

 abstract = {The development of interactive, participatory, multisensory environments that combine the physical with the virtual comes as a natural continuation to the computer game industry's constant race for more exciting user experiences. Specialized theme parks and various other leisure and entertainment centers worldwide are embracing the "interactive" promise that games have made users expect. This is not a trend limited to the entertainment domain; non-formal learning environments for children are also following this path, backed up by a theoretical notion of play as a core activity in a child's development. In this article we explore a central thread in learning, play, as well as an essential characteristic of virtual reality environments: interactivity. A critical review of examples of immersive virtual reality worlds created for children, with particular attention given to the role and nature of interactivity, is attempted. Interactivity is examined in relation to learning, play, narrative, and to characteristics inherent in virtual reality, such as immersion, presence, and the creation of illusion.},

 abstract = {Pattern recognition has as its objective to classify objects into different categories and classes. It is a fundamental component of artificial intelligence and computer vision. This thesis investigates the application of an efficient optimization method, known as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to the field of pattern recognition and image processing. First a clustering method that is based on PSO is proposed. The application of the proposed clustering algorithm to the problem of unsupervised classification and segmentation of images is investigated. A new automatic image generation tool tailored specifically for the verification and comparison of various unsupervised image classification algorithms is then developed. A dynamic clustering algorithm which automatically determines the "optimum" number of clusters and simultaneously clusters the data set with minimal user interference is then developed. Finally, PSO-based approaches are proposed to tackle the color image quantization and spectral unmixing problems. In all the proposed approaches, the influence of PSO parameters on the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Key terms: Clustering, Color Image Quantization, Dynamic Clustering, Image P},

 abstract = {Computer games have grown considerably in scale and complexity since their humble beginnings in the 1960s. Modern day computer games have reached incredible levels of realism, especially in areas like graphics, physical simulation, and artificial intelligence. However, despite significant advances in software engineering, the development of computer games generally does not employ state-of-the-art software engineering practices and tools. This thesis describes an architecture for computer games as a System of Systems where the computer game itself is emergent. The proposed architecture follows a data centered framework where the independent components collaborate on a central data store. The architecture offers capabilities that are essential in overcoming challenges faced in building computer games that can enjoy modifiability, expandability, and maintainability traits. The architecture promotes component-based development (e.g., commercial off the shelf components) since the collaborating components have loose couplings, which in turn facilitates systematic design integration of System of Systems.},

It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

The term agent, deriving from the Latin “agens”, identifies someone (or something) who acts; the same word can also be used to define a mean through which some action is made or caused. The term is used in many different fields and disciplines, such as economics, physics, natural sciences, sociology and many others. In computer science, the word is used to define very heterogeneous entities and sometimes is even abused.},

@article{Riedl2004,
 abstract = {The ability to generate narrative is of importance to computer systems that wish to use story effectively for entertainment, training, or education. We identify two properties of story – plot coherence and character believability – which play a role in the success of a story. Plot coherence is the perception by audience members that character actions have relevance to the outcome of the story. Character believability is the perception that character actions are motivated by agents' internal beliefs and desires. Unlike conventional planning in which plan goals represent an agent's intended world state, multi-agent story planning involves goals that represent the outcome of a story. In order for the plans' actions to appear believable, multi-agent story planners must determine not only how agents' actions achieve a story's goal state, but must also ensure that each agent appears to be acting intentionally. We present a narrative generation planning system for multi-agent stories that is capable of generating narratives with both strong plot coherence and strong character believability. The planning algorithm uses causal reasoning and a simulated intention recognition process to drive plan creation.},

In this paper we present a method to create scalable, interactive visualizations of small world graphs, allowing the user to inspect local clusters while maintaining a global overview of the entire structure. The visualization method uses a combination of both semantical and geometrical distortions, while the layout is generated by a spring embedder algorithm using recently developed force model.

Consider a game in which two players must each pick the same color card, both red or both black. The first picks black and the second picks red and so they lose. People think, "If only the second player had picked black." Our study tested the idea that the ways in which the players could have won provide counterfactual alternatives to the facts. In three experiments, the same set of facts (both players picked black cards), and the same winning conditions (to win in this new game they must pick different color cards) were presented, but the description of the winning conditions varied (e.g., "if one or the other but not both picks a red card" vs. "if one or the other but not both picks a black card"). The results showed that the temporal order effect can be produced or reversed by different descriptions. The descriptions make accessible different elements of the winning possibilities. A theory of the mental representations and cognitive processes underlying counterfactual thinking in the temporal order effect is described.},

@article{Zook2004,
 abstract = {Meta-AspectJ (MAJ) is a language tool for generating AspectJ programs using code templates. MAJ itself is an extension of Java, so users can interleave arbitrary Java code with AspectJ code templates. MAJ is a structured meta-programming tool: a well-typed generator implies a syntactically correct generated program. MAJ promotes a methodology that combines aspect-oriented and generative programming. Potential applications range from implementing domain-specific languages with AspectJ as a back-end to enhancing AspectJ with more powerful general-purpose constructs. In addition to its practical value, MAJ offers valuable insights to meta-programming tool designers. It is a mature meta-programming tool for AspectJ (and, by extension, Java): a lot of emphasis has been placed on context-sensitive parsing and error-reporting. As a result, MAJ minimizes the number of meta-programming (quote/unquote) operators and uses type inference to reduce the need to remember type names for syntactic entities.},
