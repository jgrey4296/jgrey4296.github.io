"I didn't see it on Tiktok. I saw it on Twitter.
Which Makes me a Scholar instead of a Fool." - NL, Afterbirth+ 1888

### On Goodness

With that said, broad positions I take: Anti-Racist, Pro-Choice, Pro-Sex Work, Pro-Trans Rights.

I Dislike intellectual property laws, and am Pro-Union, apart from Cop Unions. ACAB.
Lefter than Liberal, reading more theory to find out how much. Guillotines sound good.

I am by no means an expert on ethics or theory, but I listen, learn, and try to do better than yesterday.

### Eccentricity
If different, not criminally so.  
Privileged enough to have leveraged social capital, despite not necessarily
being suitably socially skilled.

### Stand On Zanzibar
One strong inspiration for me is John Brunner's Stand On Zanzibar. 
In it, he use's what McLuhan describes as 'The Innis Mode' after Harold
Innis. A... swirling multi perspective approach to describing an entire
society, fluidly:

> "There is nothing wilful or arbitrary about the Innis mode of expression. Were it to be translated into perspective prose, it would not only require huge space, but the insight into the modes of interplay among forms of organisation would also be lost. Innis sacrificed point of view and prestige to his sense of the urgent need for insight.  
>
> A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding. As Innis got more insight he abandoned any mere point of view in his presentation of knowlege. When he interrelates the development of the steam press with 'the consolidation of the vernaculars' and the rise of nationalism and revolution he is not reporting anybody's point of view, least of all his own. He is setting up a mosaic configuration or galaxy for insight . . . 
>
> Innis makes no effort to 'spell out' the interrelations between the components in his galaxy. He offers no consumer packages in his later work, but only do-it-yourself kits..."
>    - Marshall McLuhan: The Gutenberg Galaxy  

He does this using chapters categorized into 'Context', 'Continuity', 'Tracking With Closeups', and 'The Happening World'.
Where each provide a view of society from various distances. From adverts to the works of fictional Sociologist [Chad C. Mulligan](#chadmulligan), to main characters, to random people.

—The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan) (Note: Stand On Zanzibar was written in 68).

(HISTORY Papa Hegel he say that all we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. I know people who can’t even learn from what happened this morning. Hegel must have been taking the long view.  
—The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan)

(UNFAIR Term applied to advantages enjoyed by other people which we tried to cheat them out of and didn’t manage. See also DISHONESTY, SNEAKY, UNDERHAND and JUST LUCKY I GUESS.

(LOGIC The principle governing human intellection. Its nature may be deduced from examining the two following propositions, both of which are held by human beings to be true and often by the same people: “I can’t so you mustn’t,” and “I can but you mustn’t.”  
—The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan)
