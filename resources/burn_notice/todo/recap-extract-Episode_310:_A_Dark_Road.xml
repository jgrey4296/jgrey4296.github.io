<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Michael talks with Sam in the kitchen about possible people that could have pushed Diego off of the balcony ledge. Michael attempts to subtly obtain information from the hotel clerk in which Diego was staying at. However, the hotel clerk automatically recognizes Michael and gives him a note from the gunman. He is confused as to how she was able to recognize him and she explains that his profile was given. Inside the note is a room number. When he finds the room, he is greeted with the site of a burning room.

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Michael returns to the loft where he talks with Sam and Fiona about his findings. The room was registered under the name of a British scientist who had died in a burning room in 1999. Fiona then asks Michael to do a favor for her since she is unable to do so &quot;in her state.&quot; Michael agrees to meet with the widow.
