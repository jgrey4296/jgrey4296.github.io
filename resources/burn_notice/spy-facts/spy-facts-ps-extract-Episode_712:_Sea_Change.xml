<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A spy&apos;s job, at the most basic level, is to deceive. You build a lie. You nurture that lie, selling it to your target bit by bit, until he believes. Your lie becomes your weapon, your salvation, the only thing that stands between you and disaster. When that lie falls away, you&apos;re left with only the hard truth of who you are and what you&apos;ve done. When that happens, you&apos;re out of moves. The only thing there is to do then is await your fate.
</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As a spy, when you stop believing in the orders you&apos;ve been given, you can&apos;t just walk away. You have to go deeper. You have to lie to the people giving those orders. You have to act as if nothing&apos;s wrong. And you have to make everyone think you&apos;re dedicated to the very operation you&apos;re trying to destroy.

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When you&apos;ve worked with the same team for many years, you understand exactly how each member operates. You know their strengths, their weaknesses, and how they act under pressure. You also know what it looks like when they&apos;re trying to hide something from you.

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Navy SEALs use their comfort in the water to gain the upper hand. If an opponent panics, then all a SEAL has to do is hold his breath and let oxygen deprivation do its work. Which means the best way to fight a Navy SEAL in the water, is to force yourself to be as calm as they are. Let them think they&apos;ve won and then make your move.
