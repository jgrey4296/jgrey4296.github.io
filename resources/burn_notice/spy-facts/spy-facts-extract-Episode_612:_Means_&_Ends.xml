<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><li>Planting false information for an enemy to find is a subtle art. There has to be enough solid information to make it seem credible, but not so much it can be verified. Do it right, and you can make your target so paranoid, they&apos;ll be ready to crack.  </li>
<li>Most late-model washing machines spin at speeds of over 1,200 RPM&apos;s, and create more than 100 G&apos;s of force. That&apos;s more than enough to rip off your finger, or pull a curtain rod through a couple layers of drywall. </li>
<li>When posing as a hard-core criminal, the key is to come on strong. You sit in the power position in the room and take up as much space as possible. Any you never, ever show any respect for the police. </li>
<li>The two most challenging parts of planting a listening device are quick concealment and power. If your target wears a radio for work, you can kill two birds with one stone by bugging a duplicate power pack and switching them out. Do it right, and you get a bug that your target carries everywhere he goes.</li>
<li>As a spy, your job is often to get people to break the rules. You use their greed, their fear, or their rage to make them betray the things they value most. With a professional spy pushing them hard, most people abandon their principles, but sometimes, very occasionally, they won&apos;t. And when a target decides to stick to his principles, you can suddenly find a mission going very, very badly.</li>
<li>When you&apos;re on a high-stakes intelligence gathering operation, concentration is key. Whether you&apos;re in a car, or on the street, or doing your surveillance poolside, you have to stay focused at all times. Because even the slightest detail can mean the difference between a successful mission, and a complete disaster.</li></ul>
