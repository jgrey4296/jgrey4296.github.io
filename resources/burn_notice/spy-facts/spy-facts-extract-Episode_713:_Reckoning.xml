<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><li>There are four points in this episode where a character says a line that&apos;s said in the opening of the show:
<ul><li>When Jesse and Michael are in the car, after Michael asks Jesse to watch over his mom and Charlie, Jesse says &quot;I guess that&apos;s how we do it.&quot;</li>
<li>When Fiona and Michael are about to face-off with James&apos; men, Fi whispers to Michael, &quot;Shall we shoot them?&quot;</li>
<li>After the explosion and Michael and Fiona&apos;s &quot;death&quot; Jesse and Sam are talking to Strong, who tells them that people in the CIA want to blame them for what happened, an unsurprised Sam says, &quot;You know spies; bunch of bitchy little girls.&quot;</li>
<li>At the very end of the episode, Michael wonders how he will tell his nephew about everything. Fiona says to start with &quot;My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy.&quot;</li></ul></li>
<li>The house Michael and Fiona are living in is the same house as Kate Winslet&apos;s in The Holiday.</li>
<li>The location used for the cell-phone/convenience-store scene is the same area used for Nigeria in the pilot episode as well as other various scenes throughout the series.</li>
