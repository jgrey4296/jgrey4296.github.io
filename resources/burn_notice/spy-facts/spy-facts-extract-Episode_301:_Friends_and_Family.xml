<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><li>As an operative, you get used to being in uncomfortable situations. Whether it&apos;s resisting interrogation in a foreign prison, fighting guerrilla forces in a tropical jungle, or swimming five miles to Miami Beach in your suit pants, it&apos;s just part of the job. What&apos;s harder to get used to is going into a situation you don&apos;t know anything about. Just because you&apos;re exhausted and disoriented doesn&apos;t mean you can stop looking out for trouble. Danger isn&apos;t always obvious. It can be as subtle as a glance from a friendly seeming tourist, a car that slows down at an odd time, or a cop that suddenly seems a little too interested in you.</li></ul>
