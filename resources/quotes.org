“The incentive under capitalism is to use robots for everything except hard
wear-and-tear work, because if you wear out your robot, you have to pay to fix
it, but if you wear out your person, the NHS pays to fix them.”

 The Greatest trick the videogame industry ever pulled was convincing the world that videogames were games in the first place.
 Unlike traditional games in which voluntary rules are consciously chosen to further constrain
 or interpret the physical properties of dice and cards, balls and bats, or track and field,
 videogames conflate the rulse of a game with the mechanics of the equipment.

A white-shoe law firm or an exclusive prep school will lean far more on recommendations
and face-to-face interviews than will a fast-food chain or a cash-strapped urban school district.
The privileged, we'll see time and again, are processed more by people, the masses by machines.

There are two ways of making policy:
- tell yourself a story about what will happen and hope that it does
- rigorously ask yourself what could go wrong and have some idea what you might do if it does

friendly reminder in times of uncertainty and misinformation: anecdotes are
not data. (good) data is carefully measured and collected information based
on a range of subject-dependent factors, including, but not limited to,
controlled variables, meta-analysis, and randomization
outliers attempting to counter global consensus around this pandemic with
amateur reporting or unverified sourcing are not collecting data. breaking
news stories that only relay initial findings of an event are not
collecting data. we have to be careful in our media consumption
it can be difficult to know what to believe in a time when institutional
trust is diminished and the gatekeepers of information have been
dismantled, but it's more crucial now than ever before to follow a range
of credentialed sources for both breaking news and data collection
all we currently have are limited and evolving metrics that experts are
deciphering and acting upon immediately to the best of their ability. this
terrain leaves many openings for opportunists and charismatic manipulators
to lead people astray by exploiting what they want to hear
breaking news and storytelling will always be spun with interpretive bias
from different media perspectives, but data is a science that can't be
replaced by one-off anecdotes. try to remember this to avoid fear-based
sensationalism or conspiracy theories taking over your mind
you can maintain independent, critical thinking toward institutions
without dipping into fringe conspiracies that get jumpstarted by
individual anecdotes being virally spread as data. it's not easy, but it's
necessary to keep any semblance of responsible online information flow
we're a frozen meat brand posting ads inevitably made to misdirect people
and generate sales, so this is peak irony, but hey we live in a society so
please make informed decisions to the best of your ability and don't let
anecdotes dictate your worldview ok steak-umm bless

But another class of reasoners hold the opinion that there is no such relation between capital and labor, as assumed; and that there is no such thing as a freeman being fatally fixed for life, in the condition of a hired laborer, that both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them groundless. They hold that labor is prior to, and independent of, capital; that, in fact, capital is the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed -- that labor can exist without capital, but that capital could never have existed without labor. Hence they hold that labor is the superior -- greatly the superior -- of capital.

The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land, for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This, say its advocates, is free labor -- the just and generous, and prosperous system, which opens the way for all -- gives hope to all, and energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all. If any continue through life in the condition of the hired laborer, it is not the fault of the system, but because of either a dependent nature which prefers it, or improvidence, folly, or singular misfortune. I have said this much about the elements of labor generally, as introductory to the consideration of a new phase which that element is in process of assuming. The old general rule was that educated people did not perform manual labor. They managed to eat their bread, leaving the toil of producing it to the uneducated. This was not an insupportable evil to the working bees, so long as the class of drones remained very small. But now, especially in these free States, nearly all are educated -- quite too nearly all, to leave the labor of the uneducated, in any wise adequate to the support of the whole. It follows from this that henceforth educated people must labor. Otherwise, education itself would become a positive and intolerable evil. No country can sustain, in idleness, more than a small per centage of its numbers. The great majority must labor at something productive. From these premises the problem springs, "How can labor and education be the most satisfactory combined?"

** Adam Protextor
 "When people call you a "snowflake" just remember they're quoting Fight Club, a satire written by a gay man about how male fragility causes men to destroy themselves, resent society, and become radicalized, and that Tyler Durden isn't the hero but a personification of the main character's mental illness, and that his "snowflake" speech is a dig at how fascists use dehumanizing language to breed loyalty from insecure people.

So basically people who say "snowflake" as an insult are quoting a domestic terrorist who blows up skyscrapers because he's insecure about how good he is in bed."

OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and
hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It
can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other
systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them.

"Natural: How Faith in Nature's Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws, and Flawed Science":

And then there's the problem of my own privilege. I have never walked for miles to secure drinking water, or medicine, or books.
Machines wash my clothing and my dishes. Natural light is a wonderful thing, but for nearly a billion people with no access to power,
and billions more with only intermittent access, the prospect of unnatural light is no less wonderful.
No one has told me that my sexual orientation is unnatural, or my biology is naturally inferior.
Seen differently, praise of naturalness can look like praise of the privileges that render its downsides invisible.

** Alexander Dumas
One thing that humbles me deeply is to see that human genius has its limits while human stupidity does not.
** Alexander Hamilton
The truth unquestionably is, that the only path to a subversion of the republican system of the Country is, by flattering the prejudices of the people, and exciting their jealousies and apprehensions, to throw affairs into confusion, and bring on civil commotion. Tired at length of anarchy, or want of government, they may take shelter in the arms of monarchy for repose and security.

Those then, who resist a confirmation of public order, are the true Artificers of monarchy—not that this is the intention of the generality47 of them. Yet it would not be difficult to lay the finger upon some of their party who may justly be suspected. When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits—despotic in his ordinary demeanour—known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty—when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day—It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.”

Our new government is founded... upon the great turth that the negro is not equal to the white man;
that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.

philosophical, and moral truth.

** Ally Henny
It's funny how nooooobody talks about "Irish Slaves" until Black people start protesting for their
freedom. Then fragile people of whiteness resume their social media campaign of conflating
indentured servitude with slavery.

People will try to shout down Black folks' oppression by claiming that there were white folks who were
also oppressed, as if that somehow justifies oppression of any sort. I need y'all to get a
better narrative.

If you want to have a discussion about the injustices perpetuated against Irish immigrants, have at it.
But don't use it as a way to diminish the oppression of Black people that has spanned over 400 years
and covers five centuries of history.
** Alvin Gouldner
It follows that neither involvement suffices to sustain theorists’ efforts to develop understanding of the social totality, although ironically both Party theorists and University academicians agree that each of their (different) group environments already suffices for that very purpose. My own conclusion is to the contrary. I therefore believe that one of the central tasks of social theory in our time is to attempt to rethink the position of theory's own group involvements and to re-examine the conditions, social and organizational, requisite for the development of an effective community of theorists committed to the understanding of the social totality.

Transgenders are disgusting, revolting freaks, and are hated by most people in society

 "We got a lot of phone calls and lettes, probably more than any other episode I can recall.
Interestingly, most of the phone calls were negative, while most of the letters were positive.
One that I always remember was a call that one of our PAs took.
A man said, 'You're ruining my kids by making them watch two women kiss like that.'
And our PA said, 'Let me ask you a question. Would you have been okay if one of the women had shot the other to death with a phaser and the kids watched that?'
And he said, 'Yes, of course'.
And the PA said, 'Well, maybe you'd better think about who it is that is ruining your kids'. "

"When you debate a person about something that affects them more than it affects you, remember
that it will take a much greater emotional toll on tem than you. For you it make feel like an

consequence of your privilege, not increased objectivity on your part. Stay Humble."

"In 1996 racism may wear a new dress, buy a new pair of boots, but neither it nor its succubus twin
fascism is new or can make anything new. It can only reproduce the environment that supports its
own health: fear, denial and an atmosphere in which its victims have lost the will to fight.
The forces interested in fascist solutions to national problems are not to be found in
one political party or another, or in one or another wing of any single political party.
Democrats have no unsullied history of egalitarianism. Nor are liberals free of domination agendas.
Republicans have housed abolitionists and white supremacists.
Conservative, moderate, liberal; right, left, hard left, far right; religious, secular, socialist-

"The writer, daytime insomniac.

Granted, to write is to renounce being in command of oneself or having a proper name,
and at the same time it is not to renounce, but to announce, welcoming without recognition the absent.
Or, it is to be in relation, through words in their absence, with what one cannot remember -
a withness to the unencountered, answerable not only for the void in the subject, but for the subject
as a void, it's disappearance in the imminence of a death which has already taken place,
out of place, any place at all."

"A truly extraordinary variety of alternatives to the chemical control of insects is available.
Some are already in use and have achieved brilliant success. Others are in the stage of

All have this in common: they are biological solutions, based on understanding of the living organisms they

I cannot afford the luxury of a closed mind."


"We investigate the methodology used in a significant genre of experimental economics, in which experiments are designed to test theoretical models by implementing them in a laboratorry.
Using two case studies, we argue that such an experiment is a test, not of what the
model says about its target domain, but of generic theoretical components used in the model.
The properties that make a model interesting as a putative explanation of phenomena in its
target domain are not necessarily appropriate for such tests."

"The Terminator films are not really about the human race getting killed off by future machines.
They're about us losing touch with our own humanity and becoming machines, which
allows us to kill and brutalise each other.
Cops think of all non-cops as less than they are, stupid, weak and evil.
They dehumanise the people they are sworn to protect and desensitise themselves in order to

"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."

"Restoration is fear of mortality, or wanting to believe that anything that's broken can return

"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights".

"You cre not compelled to form a opinion about this matter before you, nor to disturb your peace of mind at all. Things in themselves have no power to extort a verdict from you."

"Until lions have their historians, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter"

"The vast accumulations of knowledge - or at least of information - deposited by the ninteeth century have been responsible for an equally vast ignorance.
When there is so much to be known, when there are so many fields of knowledge in which the same words
are used with different meanings, when every one knows a little about a great many things,
it becomes increasibly difficult for anyone to know whether he knows what he is talking about or not.
And when we do not know, or when we do not know enough, we tend always to substitute emotions for thoughts."

I think we like to complicate things when it is really quite simple;

When nonviolence is preached as an attempt to evade the repercussions of political brutality, it betrays itself. When nonviolence begins halfway through the war with the aggressor calling time out, it
exposes itself as a ruse.
When nonviolence is preached by the representatives of the state, while the state doles out
heaps of violence to its citizens, it reveals itself to be a con.
And none of this can mean that rioting or violence is "correct" or "wise", any more than a forest
fire can be "correct" or "wise".

 It’s not about giving the guests what you think they want. That’s simple. The guests don’t return for the obvious things we do, the garish things. They come back because of the subtleties, the details. They come back because they discover something they imagine no one had ever noticed before. Something they have fallen in love with. They’re not looking for a story that tells them who they are. They already know who they are. They’re here because they want a glimpse of who they could be.”

 Practice is when everything works but no one knows why.
 In our lab, theory and practice are combined: nothing works and nobody knows why.

 Being process-oriented, not product driven, is the most important and difficult skill for
 a designer to develop.
 Being process-oriented means:
 1) seeking to understand a design problem before chasing after solutions;
 2) not force-fitting solutions to old problems onto new problems
 3) removing yourself from prideful investment in your projects and being slow to fall in
    love with your ideas
 4) making design investigations and decisions holistically (that address several aspects of a
    design problem at once) rather than sequentially (that finalize one aspect of a solution
    before investigating the next)
 5) making design decisions conditionally - that is, with the awareness that they may
    or may not work out as you continue toward a final solution
 6) knowing when to change and when to stick with previous decisions
 7) accepting as normal the anxiety that comes from not knowing what to do
 8) working fluidly between concept-scale and detail-scale to see how each informs the other
 9) always asking "What if...?" regardless of how satisfied you are with your solution.

"You are the books you read, the films you watch,

“Once you’ve been to Cambodia, you’ll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands. You will never again be able to open a newspaper and read about that treacherous, prevaricating, murderous scumbag sitting down for a nice chat with Charlie Rose or attending some black-tie affair for a new glossy magazine without choking. Witness what Henry did in Cambodia – the fruits of his genius for statesmanship – and you will never understand why he’s not sitting in the dock at The Hague next to Milošević.”

Partly it’s that it allows Jews success. Many oppressions rely on keeping a targeted group of people poor, uneducated, designated non-white, or otherwise 'at the
the “middleman” - Rulers used Jews for “mid- dlemen” jobs that put Jews in direct contact with the
the Court Jew - History is full of unpopular kings who managed to save
bottom.’ Anti-Jewish oppression doesn’t depend on that. Although at many times it has kept Jews in poverty or designated non-white, these have been “optional” features. Because the point of anti-Jewish oppression is to keep a Jewish face in front, so that Jews, instead of ruling classes, become the target for peoples’ rage, it works even more smoothly when Jews are allowed some success, and can be perceived as the ones “in charge” by other oppressed groups.

I'ts absolutely possible to critique Israel without being antisemitic - but it's not automatic.
you keep things clear when you describe accurately and speicifcally what you oppose,
and critique actions and policy as unjust - not people or nations as evil.

Nowadays, anyone who wishes to combat lies and ignorance and to write the truth must overcome at least five difficulties. He must have the courage to write the truth when truth is everywhere opposed; the keenness to recognize it, although it is everywhere concealed; the skill to manipulate it as a weapon; the judgment to select those in whose hands it will be effective; and the cunning to spread the truth among such persons. These are formidable problems for writers living under Fascism, but they exist also for those writers who have fled or been exiled; they exist even for writers working in countries where civil liberty prevails.

Beneath the surface of the protective parts of trauma survivors there exists an
undamaged essence, a self that is confident, curious, and calm, a self that has
been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their efforts to ensure survival.
Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the self will spontaneously emerge,
and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process.

 'To exist is to differ; difference, in one sense, is the substantial side of things, what they have most in common and what makes them most different. One has to start from this difference and to abstain from trying to explain it, especially by starting with identity, as so many persons wrongly do. Because identity is a minimum and, hence, a type of difference, and a very rare type at that, in the same way as rest is a type of movement and the circle a type of ellipse. To begin with some primordial identity implies at the origin a prodigiously unlikely singularity, or else the obscure mystery of one simple being then dividing for no special reason.' (idem p. 73).

One day, tearing off some old bark, I saw two rare beetles and seized one in each hand;
then I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I popped the one
which I held in my right hand into my mouth.
Alas it ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was
forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as well as the third one.

"It is an honor to stand before you, for you represent the freedom and the future of our galaxy. The once-great Republic and Jedi Order have become victims of their own ambitions, and the Supreme Chancellor is no more than a pawn of corporate monopolies. As a people you called out for change, you called out for leadership, and I humbly answered that call. Together we challenged the system. We asked for equality. And how were we met? With war! The Jedi secret army of clones was revealed, and their treachery was far greater than we could have imagined! Countless living beings—these clones the Jedi created—have been sent to their deaths, while we sacrifice mainly droids. Our soldiers of flesh and blood are willing participants! They are your fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, who fight not because they were grown and designed to do so, but because they know in their hearts that they are fighting for a just and noble cause!"

The jedi order's problem is Yoda. No being can wield that kind of power for centuries without
becoming complacent at best or corrupt at worst. He has no idea that it's overtaken him;
he no longer sees all the little cumulative evils that the Republic tolerates and fosters,
from slavery to endless wars, and he never asks, "Why are we not acting to stop this?"
Live alongside corruption for too long, and you no longer notice the stench.
The Jedi cannot help the slaves of Tatooine, but they can help the slavemasters.

“The act of making music, clothes, art, or even food has a very different, and
possibly more beneficial effect on us than simply consuming those things. And
yet for a very long time, the attitude of the state toward teaching and funding
the arts has been in direct opposition to fostering creativity among the general
population. It can often seem that those in power don’t want us to enjoy making
things for ourselves—they’d prefer to establish a cultural hierarchy that
devalues our amateur efforts and encourages consumption rather than creation.
This might sound like I believe there is some vast conspiracy at work, which I
don’t, but the situation we find ourselves in is effectively the same as if
there were one. The way we are taught about music, and the way it’s socially and
economically positioned, affect whether it’s integrated (or not) into our lives,
and even what kind of music might come into existence in the future. Capitalism
tends toward the creation of passive consumers, and in many ways this tendency
is counterproductive.”

When you write humor, people think that you just record into a tape recorder and
then someone else transcribes your words. It doesn’t occur to them that you have

Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this:

'You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do. What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. Those of you who are more robust and individual than others will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself — educating your own judgements. Those that stay must remember, always, and all the time, that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this particular society.

"In recent years a good deal of the very best sociological work has been devoted to the study of organization. Although the term, organization, belongs to the category of expressions about which there is maintained an air of informed vagueness, certain special conventions exist that focus its use, with qualifications, on a delimited set of phenomena. In accordance with these conventions, the term applies correctly to stable associations of persons engaged in concerted activities directed to the attainment of specific objectives. It is thought to be a decisive characteristic of such organizations that they are deliberately instituted relative to these objectives. Because organizations, in this sense, are implementing and implemented programs of action that involve a substantial dose of comprehensive and rational planning, they are identified as instances of formal or rational organization in order to differentiate them from other forms."

The Places We Go When We Leave

There are worls upon worls all blooming with wonder
& numberless doorways between
& when we are done with mere skin & bone
we become travelers of shadow & dreamswe do not need form, nor breath, eyes or claws
to hunt through the brilliance & gleam
& all pain fades away, all fear falls to gray
when we go where we go when we leave
but memory persists & love still exists
& we wait close & we watch as you grieve
for we know that you can't know the places we go
when our bodies fall finally to sleep
but don't hurt for us long, nor imagine us gone
though we've slipped into beauty unseen:
we're waiting right here for when you finally appear
& we can both go where we go when we leave.

“I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes, - a justifier of the most appalling barbarity, - a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds, - and a dark shelter under, which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of the slaveholders find the strongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, next to enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others.”

 “I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ; I therefore hatethe corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial, and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels.”

In this they proceeded on the sound principle that the magnitude of a lie always contains a certain factor of credibility, since the great masses of the people in the very bottom of their hearts tend to be corrupted rather than consciously and purposely evil, and that, therefore, in view of the primitive simplicity of their minds they more easily fall a victim to a big lie than to a little one, since they themselves lie in little things, but would be ashamed of lies that were too big. Such a falsehood will never enter their heads and they will not be able to believe in the possibility of such monstrous effrontery and infamous misrepresentation in others; yes, even when enlightened on the subject, they will long doubt and waver, and continue to accept at least one of these causes as true. Therefore, something of even the most insolent lie will always remain and stick – a fact which all the great lie-virtuosi and lying-clubs in this world know only too well and also make the most treacherous use of.

 “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”

In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life. That is, a class requiring but a low order of intellect and but little skill. Its requisites are vigor, docility, fidelity. Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill. Fortunately for the South, she found a race adapted to that purpose to her hand. A race inferior to her own, but eminently qualified in temper, in vigor, in docility, in capacity to stand the climate, to answer all her purposes. We use them for our purpose, and call them slaves. We found them slaves by the common "consent of mankind," which, according to Cicero, "lex naturae est." The highest proof of what is Nature's law. We are old-fashioned at the South yet; slave is a word discarded now by "ears polite;" I will not characterize that class at the North by that term; but you have it; it is there; it is everywhere; it is eternal.

The Senator from New York said yesterday that the whole world had abolished slavery. Aye, the name, but not the thing; all the powers of the earth cannot abolish that. God only can do it when he repeals the fiat, "the poor ye always have with you;" for the man who lives by daily labor, and scarcely lives at that, and who has to put out his labor in the market, and take the best he can get for it; in short, your whole hireling class of manual laborers and "operatives," as you call them, are essentially slaves. The difference between us is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment among our people, and not too much employment either. Yours are hired by the day, not cared for, and scantily compensated, which may be proved in the most painful manner, at any hour in any street in any of your large towns. Why, you meet more beggars in one day, in any single street of the city of New York, than you would meet in a lifetime in the whole South. We do not think that whites should be slaves either by law or necessity. Our slaves are black, of another and inferior race. The status in which we have placed them is an elevation. They are elevated from the condition in which God first created them, by being made our slaves. None of that race on the whole face of the globe can be compared with the slaves of the South. They are happy, content, unaspiring, and utterly incapable, from intellectual weakness, ever to give us any trouble by their aspirations. Yours are white, of your own race; you are brothers of one blood. They are your equals in natural endowment of intellect, and they feel galled by their degradation. Our slaves do not vote. We give them no political power. Yours do vote, and, being the majority, they are the depositories of all your political power. If they knew the tremendous secret, that the ballot-box is stronger than "an army with banners," and could combine, where would you be? Your society would be reconstructed, your government overthrown, your property divided, not as they have mistakenly attempted to initiate such proceedings by meeting in parks, with arms in their hands, but by the quiet process of the ballot-box. You have been making war upon us to our very hearthstones. How would you like for us to send lecturers and agitators North, to teach these people this, to aid in combining, and to lead them?

Protesters don't block traffic to gain your support. They do it so you can see what it feels
like to be stuck in a powerless situation.
How do you respond to this situation?
Are you calm and peaceful?
Do you want to spend years organizing political talks about it?
Nope, you want to run those protesters over, kill them, kill them all.

What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label, "Liberal"? If by "Liberal" they mean, as they want people to believe, someone who is soft in his policies abroad, who is against local government, and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer's dollar, then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of "Liberal." But, if by a "Liberal," they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people - their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights, and their civil liberties - someone who believes that we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal," then I'm proud to say that I'm a "Liberal."

“Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: “It’s not where you take things from - it’s where you take them to."
** Joe Wintergreen
Randomly started thinking about AI and started making a system where like, each type of action
(take cover/flank/shoot target/throw grenade/wander/move to target) is kept in an object with a
CanExecute function (which returns wheter i'ts a good idea to do that thing right now or not)
and then on tick the ai goes through a list of actions and executes the first one that CanExecute.
So theoretically you can have like, a Combat row on a data table that has a list of objects with the thing you
really want the AI to do at the top and fallbacks under that like this.

It's harder to be a politican than it is to be a scientist, and less fun.
In science, you have to suspend belief, and it has to be shown to you, whereas
politicans have to always be certain.
The problem is that most things aren't very certain, and that's not a way to inspire voters,
to say, 'maybe'.
** John Brown
I believe to have interfered as I have done... on behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong,
but right. Now, if it be deemed necesssary that I should forfeit my life for the
furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children,
and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel and unjust
enactments, I submit: so leet it be done.

4) (COINCIDENCE You weren’t paying attention to the other half of what was going on.

—The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan)

5) It's no cooincidence “that we have muckers. Background: ‘mucker’ is an Anglicisation of ‘amok’. Don’t believe anyone who says it’s a shifted pronunication of ‘mugger’. You can survive a mugger, but if you want to survive a mucker the best way is not to be there when it happens.

“Prior to the twentieth century the densest concentration of human beings was almost certainly found in Asian cities. (Except Rome and I’m coming to Rome later.) When too many people got in your way you armed yourself with a panga or a kris and went out to cut some throats. It didn’t matter if you were educated in their use or not—the people you came up against were in their normal frame of reference and died. You were in the berserk frame of reference. Background: the berserkers developed from communities who for a large part of the year sat on their asses in Norwegian fjordal valleys with an unclimbable mountain range on each side, a lid of horrible grey cloud on top, and you couldn’t get away by sea either because of the winter storms.

“There’s a saying among the Nguni of South Africa that you didn’t only have to kill a Zulu warrior—you had to push him over to make him lie down. Background: Chaka Zulu made it a policy to take his assegai-fodder from their parents in early childhood and raise them in barrack-like conditions owning no possessions bar a spear, a shield and a sheath to hide the penis, with absolutely no privacy. He made independently the same discovery the Spartans made.

“Also it was when Rome had already become the world’s first million-city that the Eastern mystery religions with their concomitant self-privation and self-mutilation took hold. You fell in behind the procession honouring Cybele, you seized a knife from one of the priests, you cut your balls off and ran through the streets waving them till you came to a house with the door open when you threw them over the threshold. They gave you an outfit of women’s clothing and you joined the priesthood. Reflect on the pressure that drove you to think that that was the easy way out!”

6) (HUMAN BEING You’re one. At least, if you aren’t, you know you’re a Martian or a trained dolphin or Shalmaneser.

If you want me to tell you more than that, you’re out of luck. There’s nothing more anybody can tell you.

—The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan)

7) “Rather painfully, we managed to digest Darwinian evolution so far as physical attributes were concerned within half a century of the initial controversy. (I say ‘we,’ but if you’re a bible-thumping fundamentalist I expect you at this point to take the book by one corner at arm’s length and ceremonially consign it to the place where you put most sensible ideas, along with everything else you decline to acknowledge the existence of, such as mainly shit.)

“We still haven’t digested the truth that evolution applies to mental functions, too—that because a dog is a dog, a dolphin a dolphin, it has an awareness and sense of personal identity distinct from ours but not necessarily inferior. Is an apple inferior to an orange?

“But I’m trying to tell you what’s happening to you, not what’s happening to Crêpe Suzette your neurotic poodle. A good veterinary psychologist can probably be located by calling Information. You wouldn’t believe him if he started telling you how much you have in common with that pet of yours, and likely you won’t believe me. But if I annoy you sufficiently you may at least try to think up arguments to demonstrate how wrong I am.

“Basically, then: you have two things in common. You’re a pack-animal; so is a dog. You’re a territorial animal; so is a dog. (The fact that we mark our manors with walls instead of urine is irrelevant.)

“The depiction of Man the Noble Savage standing off the wolves at the cave entrance, all by himself with a club, while his mate and their young cower in the background, is so much whaledreck. When we were at the stage of taking refuge in caves our habit was almost certainly to congregate in troupes the way baboons still do, and when the dog-baboons move in everyone else—note that everyone!—moves out. I mean like lions will shift the scene, and a lion is not what you’d call a defenceless creature.

“Lions are rather solitary, tending to work by couples over a manor which affords them adequate game for subsistence. Or not, depending on outside pressure from other members of the species. (Try owning a whole tomcat and you’ll see the process in miniature.) Pack-animals have the evolutionary edge—in combination they’re deadly. Lions learn this as cubs and then ignore the practice, which is why baboons can cave them in.

“NB: I said ‘everyone’, not ‘everything’. You wouldn’t recognise your ancestors as people, but they were, and you still are. Those ancestors were arrogant bastards—how else did they become boss species on our ball of mud? You’ve inherited from them just about everything that makes you human, apart from a few late glosses such as language. You got territoriality along with the rest. If somebody trespasses on it you’re liable to turn killer—although if you don’t like the idea you can kill yourself, which is among our few claims to uniqueness.

“Territoriality works this way. Take some fast-breeding animals like rats—or even rabbits, though they’re herbivorous rodents, not carnivores as we are—and let them multiply in an enclosure, making sure at all stages they have enough food and water. Early on you’ll see them behaving in the traditional rat fashion when conflicts arise: the quarrellers will square up to one another, feint, jab, charge and withdraw, the victory going to the more efficient braggart. Also the mothers will take good care, rat-style, of their young.

“When the pen becomes crowded past a certain point, the fights won’t be symbolic any more. There’ll be corpses. And the mothers will start to eat their young.

“It’s even more spectacular in the case of solitary creatures. Put a female ripe for mating into too small a cage that’s already occupied by a healthy male, and he’ll drive her out rather than give way to the reproductive urge. He may even kill her.

“Very baldly, then: shortage of territory, of space to move around and call your own, leads to attacks on members of your own species in defiance even of the normal group-solidarity displayed by pack-animals. Lost your temper with anyone lately?

“However, being a member of a species that’s nothing if not ingenious, you’ve figured out two directions in which you can abstract your territoriality: one is to privacy, the other is to property.

“Of the two, the former is more animal and more reliable. Your base need is to have a manor defined against a peer group, but you don’t have to do as dogs, tomcats and sundry other species do—mark it out with a physical trace, then patrol it constantly to scare away intruders. You can abstract to a small enclosed area where no one else trespasses without your permission, and on this basis you can operate fairly rationally. One of the first concomitants of affluence is a rapid raising of privacy-standards: someone from a comparatively low-income background has to accept that his childhood will be lived in a crowded, busy environment—in contemporary household terms, one room of the dwelling (if it has more than one) will be a family-room and that’s the centre of operations. Someone from a more prosperous home, however, will take it for granted from about the time he learns to read that there’s a room where he can go in and shut the door against the world.

“This is why (a) men from wealthy backgrounds make better companions under privative conditions such as a Moon voyage—they don’t feel that their human environment is a permanent infringement of their right to a manor, no matter how thoroughly it’s been abstracted from the original referent of a piece of terrain (b) the standard route out of the slum or ghetto is crime—equals getting your own back on other members of your species who trespass continually on your manor; (c) gangs develop primarily in two contexts—first, in the slum or ghetto where privacy as a counterpart of the manor can’t be had and a reversion takes place to the wild state, with pack-hunting and the patrolling of an actual physical patch of ground; and second, in the armed services, where the gang is dignified by being called a ‘regiment’ or some other hifalutin dirty word but where the reversion to the wild state is deliberately fostered by deprivation of privacy (barracks accommodation) and deprivation of property (you don’t wear the clothes you chose and bought, you wear a uniform which belongs to US!!!). Fighting in an army is a psychotic condition encouraged by a rule-of-thumb psychological technique discovered independently by every son-of-a-bitch conqueror who ever brought a backward people out of a comfortable, civilised state of nonentity (Chaka Zulu, Attila, Bismarck, etc.) and started them slaughtering their neighbours. I don’t approve of people who encourage psychoses in their fellow human beings. You probably do. Cure yourself of the habit.

“We are breeding so fast that we cannot provide adequate privacy for our population. That might not be fatal—after all, it wasn’t until as a species we discovered affluence that the demand for it became overwhelming. But we’re undermining the alternative form of abstraction of territoriality, and deprived of both we’re going to wind up psychotic in the same way as a good soldier.

“The point of abstracting to property is that the manor forms an externalised aid to self-identification. Put a man in a sensory deprivation tank, he comes out screaming or shaking or … We need continual environmental reassurance that we are who we think we are. In the wild state, the manor provides such a reassurance. In the state we’ve been describing a few paragraphs back, the ability to shut ourselves away from the continually fluctuating pressure of our peers enables an intermittent reassessment of our identity. We can lean on a group of objects—a clever surrogate for a patch of ground—but only if they have (a) strong personal connotations and (b) continuity. The contemporary environment denies us both. The objects we possess weren’t made by ourselves (unless we’re fortunate enough to display strong creative talents) but by an automated factory, and furthermore and infinitely worse we’re under pressure every week to replace them, change them, introduce fluidity into precisely that area of our lives where we most need stability. If you’re rich enough you go and buy antiques and you like them as a pipeline into the past, not because you’re a connoisseur.

“The classical slave system survived for a long while despite the paradoxical discontinuity of pan-human identity which is implicit in any such social pattern. The American slave system was already breaking to pieces before the Civil War. Why? The answer is in the Code of Hammurabi, among other places—the first truly elaborate legal code we have any record of. It lays down fines and other punishments for personal injury. Although it’s true that the penalty for injuring a free man is heavier than for injuring a slave, the slave is always there. Under the Romans, a slave had a certain inalienable minimum both of property (NB!) and of civil rights, which not even his owner could infringe. It was thinkable for a debtor to sell himself into slavery and pay off what he owed, in the rational—maybe far-fetched, but not lunatic—anticipation of recouping his fortunes. The first successful banker we know about was a Greek slave called Pasion who made himself a millionaire, bought his freedom and went into partnership with his former bosses.

“In the case of the American negro slave this possibility was not inherent in the system. The slave had the same human rights as a head of cattle—nil. A good master might conceivably manumit a slave who’d done him a good turn, or pension him off with his freedom as a favourite horse would be put out to pasture to spend his declining years in peace. But a bad one might decide to maim the man, brand him, or flog him to death with an iron-tipped cat-o’-nine-tails, and there was no one to call him to account.

“True, you’re not a slave. You’re worse off than that by a long, long way. You’re a predatory beast shut up in a cage of which the bars aren’t fixed, solid objects you can gnaw at or in despair batter against with your head until you get punch-drunk and stop worrying. No, those bars are the competing members of your own species, at least as cunning as you on average, forever shifting around so you can’t pin them down, liable to get in your way without the least warning, disorienting your personal environment until you want to grab a gun or an axe and turn mucker. (This is in essence why people do that.)

“And there are more of them than ever before—and you’ve grown to expect privacy so that every now and then you can take the pressure off, but that privacy is becoming more and more expensive so that it’s considered normal for even well-paid businessmen to share their apartments in order to enjoy luxuries their own salaries won’t stretch to, such as rooms large enough to hold their private possessions as well as themselves—and you’re being commanded by today’s aggressive advertising to throw out those cherished belongings and get others which are strange to you—and you’re being told day and night from authoritative official sources that people you don’t know but who adhere to some mysterious quasi-religious precepts known as Marxist-Leninist-Maoist dogma and communicate in a language whose characters you can’t even recognise as real writing are trying to trespass on your national gang’s manor—and …

“In the last decade of the twentieth century sales of tranks soared a whopping thirteen hundred per cent. Unless you’ve been living in a country too poor to furnish the supplies, the odds are that two of every five of your acquaintances are dicties—perhaps on some socially acceptable drug like alcohol, but quite likely on a trank that by way of side-effect depresses orgasmic capacity and compels the user to resort to orgies in order to stimulate flagging potency, or on a product like Skulbustium which offers the tempting bait of a totally, untrespassably private experience and entrains senile dementia rather more certainly than tobacco entrains cancer of the lung.

“In short: your life from birth to death resembles the progress of a hopelessly drunk tightrope walker whose act has been so bad up till now that he’s being bombarded with rotten eggs and broken bottles.

“And if you fall off, what they will do is broadly this: they’ll take you out of the environment you’re used to—you don’t like it much, but at least it’s not totally strange—and put you somewhere else you’ve never been before. Your key deprivation is of territoriality; they will shove you in a cell which has nothing whatever about it to help identify you as an individual. Your secondary lacks are of abstracted territoriality-equivalents; they will take away the clothes you chose yourself and give you tattered second- or twentieth-hand garments, and you will have no privacy whatever because on the basis of a time-schedule deliberately randomised so that you can’t even brace yourself for the impact by the clock of hunger you carry in your stomach they will fling open the door and stare at you to see what you’re doing.

“You will wind up inventing a private language because there’s no other way of isolating yourself; you’ll scrawl on the walls with your excrement because nothing else in the place belongs to you except the products of your own body; and they will call you a hopeless case and intensify the ‘treatment’ you’re receiving.

“Don’t say that it won’t happen to you. The odds in favour have been going up daily for a hundred years. You know at least half a dozen people who have been in mental hospitals, and of that half-dozen at least one was related to you, even if no more closely than as a cousin. Again, if this is not the case, that’s because you’ve been living in a country too poor to afford enough mental hospitals for its population on the generally accepted scale.

“Thank heaven for such countries! You might do worse than emigrate to one if what I’ve been saying worries you.”

10) “At bottom the human species finds idealism an uncomfortable posture. Prime evidence of this can be found in the way neither of the two groups locked in irresoluble conflict around the Pacific has been able to achieve its stated goal—even though, given the lucid, simple, obviously attractive statement of either of their ideals, an impartial observer might wonder why commitment had not ensued like sunrise after night.

“‘Give the wealth back to the people who created it!’ Here’s an ideal capable of generating crusades among people who interpret it as expropriating greedy landlords, sharing out land so that every family may enjoy reasonable nutrition and repudiating debts to moneylenders at usurious rates of interest. Having hit on this, the Chinese charged ahead—until they overreached themselves. They became unable to distinguish between the evils they were preaching against and those traditional influences which literally constituted the way of life of people they hoped to recruit to their cause. In short order they fell into the same pit as their rivals, who had for decades ignored the plain and simple fact that to a starving man ‘freedom’ implies a full rice-bowl—or, if he has an exceptional imagination, a healthy ox to pull his plough. It has nothing to do with voting for a political delegate.

“Analogously with the way the Tsarist army deserted en masse during the First World War, not because of Bolshevik impact on the soldiers but because they were sick of fighting and wanted to go tend their farms, the eager early recruits to the red flag discovered that while they were dying abroad the things they wanted to guard were being undermined at home. So they quit. China, like Russia before her, found she was surrounded by a gaggle of heirs to the mantle of the late Marshal Tito, not a few of whom were themselves within China’s boundary.

“However, by that time, thanks to ineptitude, racial prejudice against them, fighting the right wars with the wrong weapons, and general mismanagement of their affairs, the opposition (or if you prefer, which I don’t because I’d rather not identify with such a bunch of incompetents, ‘our side’) was so far in arrears that the greatest single territorial gain to date in a contest which bids fair to outdo the Hundred Years’ War both for duration and for inconclusiveness only restored a rough balance and didn’t tip the scales the other way.

“We can’t even claim in honesty that it was the result of foresight and planning—only that when the grabbing was good, we grabbed. Don’t believe anyone who tries to claim that the existence of Isola is proof of the superiority of the Western system. The Chinese couldn’t have taken over. There was no form of discontent they could have exploited. How do you whip up resentment against absentee landlords and pocketers of bribes when the highest ambition of the people concerned is either to become the former or be in a position to receive the latter?

“Life in the Philippines had become intolerable well before the civil war of the 1980s. The state of things obtaining (which some accounts misname anarchy, but which any decent dictionary will tell you was nothing of the sort, but free-enterprise capitalism gone out of its skull) was on the verge of ruining the country permanently. The annual average of unsolved murders was running around 30,000 in a population of under fifty million. In the eyes of the inhabitants of the Sulu Archipelago, where most of them were committed, the offence for which they revolted against and ultimately assassinated President Sayha was that he interfered in their traditional right to slaughter and steal. This was unforgivable.

“Oh, doubtless there were some among the people who gave that celebrated majority of eighty-eight per cent in the plebiscite on secession who hoped that being policed and governed by Big Brother in Washington would ensure them a quieter life, free them from the need to fit bullet-proof shutters and plant man-traps in their gardens. Far more, however, seem to have hoped that the bait on the hook (full States’ rights and a billion dollars of aid) would offer another and fatter cake of which they could snatch their slice.

“Which of these parties saw its dream fulfilled? Dear reader, you must be joking. That vaunted billion-dollar aid budget went nowhere near the natives’ pockets. It was spent on roads, airfields, port facilities and fortifications. And, while it’s true that the smugglers and black-marketeers who had hitherto rampaged unchecked had their hinder ends smartly kicked, to get rid of them the new owners imposed martial law and it hasn’t been lifted since 1991!

“Dubbed ‘Isola’ on the grounds that Montana was a mountainous territory and the new acquisition was an island territory, the Junior State went from the frying-pan into the fire. However, the Americans had been desperately in need of bases closer to the Asian mainland than what they currently had, and they were reasonably well satisfied.

“The Chinese, on the other hand, when they tried a counterstroke by wooing Yatakang, were disappointed. The Yatakangi are descendants of the former dominant people in South-East Asia and firm believers in the traditional military dictum that the first thing you do after contracting an alliance is prepare plans for the day when your ally welshes on you. Just because they’re Asiatics it doesn’t follow that they’re going to invite their yellow fellows into their beds. Nor, because they haven’t performed the Peking kotow, should it be assumed (as some blockbottoms I know in Washington have assumed) that they are all set to become the second Isola. Why should they? Things are peachy down in Yatakang; it’s among the world’s great nations, by Asian standards it’s fabulously wealthy, and it can enjoy the game of playing off Washington against Peking until doomsday, on present evidence.

“Until doomsday? Well, perhaps that’s a slight exaggeration. There’s one bright spot in the generally gloomy picture known as the Pacific Conflict Zone. According to my calculations, by the year 2500 or so we should have killed off every last member of our species who is stupid enough to take part in so futile a pastime as this war between ‘ideals’, and with luck they won’t have left their genes behind because they’ll typically have been killed at an age when society thinks they’re too young to assume the responsibility of childbearing. And after that we may get some peace and quiet for a change.”

11) “People who feel the need to foul up their perceptions with hop or Yaginol or Skulbustium simply aren’t turned on to the essential truth that the real world can always be identified by its unique characteristic: it, and it only, can take us completely by surprise.

“Take two lumps of greyish metal and bring them together. Result: one wrecked city.

“Could anyone have predicted or envisaged that until they knew enough about the real world to calculate the properties of a substance called Uranium-235?

“People are going around marvelling at the fact that there’s a solid scientific basis for palmistry. Anybody with a grain of intelligence could have said, directly the notion of the genetic code was formulated, that there was no a priori reason why the pattern of the folds in the palm should not be related to a person’s temperament by way of an association of genes sharing the same chromosome. Indeed, there were all kinds of reasons for assuming this actually was so, because we aren’t totally stupid—as I’ve pointed out before—and unless there was in palmistry some element of relevance to real experience we’d have given it up and gone chasing some other will-o’-the-wisp. There’s no shortage of them.

“But it took forty years for someone to conduct a properly rigorous study of the subject and demonstrate that the suspicion was well-founded. This I do find remarkable—or disheartening might be a better word.

“All right: what should you be surprised at, these days?

“The fact that, having learned so much about ourselves—the designs on our palms being just one example of the way we’ve analysed ourselves down to the constituent molecules, so that we can claim to be in sight of the day when we won’t merely be able to ensure the sex of our offspring (if we can afford the fee) but also to choose whether we’ll have a math genius in the family, or a musician, or a moron (some people might like to breed a moron for a pet, I guess…)—having got to this state, then, we know less about our reactions in the mass than we do about the behaviour of non-human things like a lump of U-235.

14) “To my mind the most frightening book ever published is Lewis F. Richardson’s Statistics of Deadly Quarrels. You’ve probably never heard of it even though its relevance to the mess you’re in is at least as great as that of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, which you learned about in fourth grade. And that’s because it’s so completely terrifying only those ‘experts’ who are adequately armoured with preconceived contrary ideas which will enable them to disregard Richardson’s work completely ever get to study it.

“The subject, of course, is one which you think you’re an expert on, too—just as was the case when Darwin started stirring things up. People knew they were conscious, intelligent beings and apparently if they conceded the resemblance between themselves and the animals they were well acquainted with they attributed it to a lack of imagination on the part of the Creator—or perhaps even lauded a proper Puritan parsimony in His unwillingness to waste a good working design after it had been field-tested by the apes.

“So you believe that it’s in the interests of your family, friends and compatriots when you doll yourself up in uniform, take the gun you’re issued and go off to a messy death in the swamps of some place you wouldn’t visit on vacation even if you were a centenarian who’d been every place else bar Mars.

“What Richardson demonstrated in essence (and what has been reinforced by the small handful of people who’ve followed up his work over the past half-century) was that war follows a stochastic distribution: that’s to say, it’s neither absolutely random, nor yet is it definable in a systematic pattern, but something between the two. The pattern is there, but we cannot attribute one-for-one a causal relationship that would account for every specific case.

“In other words, the incidence of war is independent of the volitional element. It makes no odds whatever whether a rational decision has been taken—war, like the weather, just happens.

“Much earlier than Richardson, before World War I, in fact, Norman Angell had shown that the idea of fighting a war for profit was obsolete. The victors would pay a heavier cost than the losers. He was right, and that First World War proved the fact. The second one hammered it home with everything up to and including nuclear weapons. In an individual one would regard it as evidence of insanity to see someone repeatedly undertaking enterprises that resulted in his losing precisely what he claimed he was trying to achieve; it is not less lunatic to do it on the international scale, but if you’ve been catching the news lately you’ll have noticed it’s being done more than ever. The Chinese go on bleating about the withering away of the state and never stop conducting a series of harassing skirmishes on their neighbours’ territory that compels them with true Marxist inevitability to regiment and regulate their population. The Americans and their allies—what few we have left—boast of their unprecedented degree of personal freedom and submit their sovereignty to a computer in Washington, known as the draft selector, which every day condemns several hundreds of them to a death as pointless as that of the Roman gladiators. Put it this way: suppose there were a mindless idiot on your block (and until GT produces proof that Shalmaneser really can develop intelligence I shall go on regarding computers of whatever breed as idiots savants), and once a week his mental condition cycled into a state where he needed to tear someone else apart with his nails and teeth—and the consensus among your neighbours was that every family in turn should detail one of its members to stroll along to where this idiot lived and lie down for him to slaughter …

“There: I told you you were an expert on this subject. This is exactly what the draft does, except that it doesn’t take the sort of member your family might spare—grandma aged 107 who’s been senile for years, for example, or that baby who somehow crept through the filter of eugenic legislation and wound up with phenylketonuria. It takes the handsomest, healthiest, most vigorous, and nobody else.

“Remind you of something? It should do; the folk imagination has occasional curious insights and one of them has been repeated for uncountable millennia. From Andromeda chained on her rock to the maidens offered up to the dragon St. George slew, the theme of destroying the most precious, the most valuable, the least replaceable of our kinfolk recurs and recurs in legend. It tells us with a wisdom that we do not possess as individuals but certainly possess collectively that when we go to war we are ruining ourselves.

“But you’re an expert on this, aren’t you? You know very well that it’s thanks to the Confederate dead, or the victims of the Long March, or the heroic pilots of the Battle of Britain, or self-incinerated kamikazes, that you’re here, today, enjoying your wonderful daily life so full of pleasure, reward, love, joy and excitement.

“Actually I’ll wager that it’s rather more full of anxiety, problems, economic difficulties, quarrels and disappointments, but if you’re so attached to them I shan’t be able to shake you loose. Love and joy are incredibly habit-forming; often a single exposure is enough to cause permanent addiction. But I have no doubt you steer clear as much as you can of anything so masterful.”

—You’re an Ignorant Idiot by Chad C. Mulligan

15) “If you want to know what’s shortly due for the guillotine look for the most obvious of all symptoms: extremism. It is an almost infallible sign—a kind of death-rattle—when a human institution is forced by its members into stressing those and only those factors which are identificatory, at the expense of others which it necessarily shares with competing institutions because human beings belong to all of them. A sound biological comparison would be the development of the fangs of the sabre-tooth tiger to the point where the beasts can’t close their mouths any more, or the growth of armour that’s indisputably impregnable but which weighs so much the owner can’t support his bulk.

“On this basis, it’s fairly certain that Christianity won’t last out the twenty-first century. To take but a couple of prime instances: the hiving off from Rome of the so-called Right Catholics, and the appearance of the Divine Daughters as an influential pressure-group. The former exhibits a remarkable deviation from the traditional attitude of the Catholic Church as an institution that above all concerned itself with the family, Western style; the Right Catholics have become so obsessed with the simple act of fucking that they appear to have no time left for other aspects of human relationships, although they issue pronunciamenti galore on them. None of these bears even the slight relevance to contemporary reality which a sympathetic eye (not mine) can detect in similar statements originating from the Vatican. And the latter, who professedly model themselves on the mediaeval orders of nuns but who actually have borrowed the majority of their tenets—antimechanisation, distrust of bodily pleasure and so on—from respectable, well-integrated groups like the Amish and then soured them by a judicious admixture of the vinegar of hatred, are capitalising on about the most self-defeating of modern trends, our reluctance to further overburden our resources by having large families. They exploit our vicarious appreciation of people, especially women, who decline to have any progeny whatever, thus relieving us of a sense of personal responsibility for the whole damned mess.

“They won’t last.

“I can’t say I see much better times ahead for Muslims, either; though Islam has become a sizeable minority religion in the Western West in the past half-century, the spearhead of its advance has been the descendant of a schism, like the Right Catholics. I mean, naturally, the Children of X, who have constructed nothing more than an analogue of Christianity using their murdered patron as their Osiris-Attis-Jesus figure. They’ll go the way of the mystery religions of ancient times, and for the same reason: they’re exclusionist, and you aren’t allowed in unless you fulfil certain conditions of birth, primarily that you should be recognisably coloured. (I feel a lot less strongly, by the way, about racial discrimination in organisations I don’t want to join. It’s an indication that they’ll die out eventually.)

“Regrettably, however, this leper-mark of extremism isn’t confined to such expendable traits as religion. Look at sex, for example. More and more people are spending more time at it, and resorting to ever more devious ways of keeping up their enthusiasm, like commercially available aphrodisiacs and parties that are considered to be failures unless they evolve into orgies. A hundred different shiggies a year, which is something a young man can achieve without doing more than taking off his clothes, fulfils neither of the essential biological requirements of the sexual urge: it doesn’t lead to a stable environment for the cubs of the next generation, nor does it establish the kind of rapport between couples (or multiples—marriage works on all kinds of bases, not invariably monogamous) which serves to avert crisis over the possession of other members of the species. On the contrary, it leads rather to a kind of frenzy, because instead of the partners enjoying a continual and reciprocal reassurance about their respective masculinity/femininity they are driven to seek that reassurance anew every few days.

“In effect, applying the yardstick of extremism leads one to conclude that the human species itself is unlikely to last very long.”

*** THE PROS AND CONS OF A LUNATIC SOCIETY

“Thank you for that kind introduction, Madam Chairman. Well, ladies and
gentlemen—you will forgive me for sitting down while I address you, I’m
sure, because coming home from Moonbase Zero after a long stay is rather
like getting up after being bedridden for a month and carrying one’s own
weight under six times the lunar gravity is a tiring task.

“I thought I might begin by answering some of the questions which people
most commonly ask me, and to which I assume the answers aren’t very widely
known or else they wouldn’t crop up so often. As you know, my speciality is
psychology, so people very often say to me, ‘Isn’t it a terrible strain
living up there on the Moon—isn’t it a hostile, terrifying environment?’

“They’re always surprised when I say no, not nearly as bad as right here on
Earth. But that’s the literal truth. You see, on the Moon you know exactly
how the environment can be hostile to you. You know that if you puncture a
tunnel-wall, or snag your suit, you’re in danger of death, or at least of
losing a limb to dehydratory gangrene when the sphincter at the next joint
inwards seals off the empty section of the suit. You know that if you forget
to switch your suit to reflecting before crossing a patch of open ground in
full sunlight you’ll bake before you return to shadow, and if you don’t cut
in your heaters when you go out at night your feet will be frostbitten
within fifty metres.

“More important than that, though, you know you’re in an environment where
co-operation is essential to survival.

“There are no strangers on the Moon. I’ve had my life saved three separate
times by people I’d never met before and one of them was a Chinese. I’ve
done the same—and this is not in any sense boasting because it’s a fact of
lunar existence—for two people, one a professional colleague and one a
novice I hadn’t even spoken to since his arrival a week earlier.

“Living-space is at a premium, of course, and we’re all jammed together in a
sort of immobile submarine, but we’re hand-picked for our ability to make
allowances for the failings of our fellow human beings, and anyone who
doesn’t measure up to the intensive demands of the lunar base is shipped
home fast. Perhaps some of you have seen a play called ‘Macbeth of Moonbase
Zero’, Hank Sodley’s remake of the Shakespeare original, in which this
paranoid establishes contact with aliens who can predict the future? The
whole thing’s a nonsense, because paranoia loses its meaning on the Moon.
You are being threatened, and you can learn and control the forces
threatening you.

“Down here on Earth, though, you may walk around the corner and find
yourself confronting a mucker with an axe or a gun. You may catch a strain
of antibiotic-resistant germs. You may—especially here on the West Coast—run
into one of the little pranks invented by the funny people who treat
sabotage as an amusing hobby. You have absolutely no way of telling whether
that innocuous stranger over there is about to haul out a weapon and attack
you, or blow a disease your way, or explode an incendiary bomb in your
disposall tube.

“In short, life on the Moon is much more like Bushman society prior to
European contamination, or the basal culture of the Zuñi, than it is like
life here in California or Moscow or Peking.

“That’s why we Lunatics don’t regard our environment as intolerable. Muckers
don’t develop where people feel that everyone else is on their own side
rather than out to undermine them. Diseases can be controlled almost down to
single organisms because we have the finest sterilisation facilities
imaginable—just let a little space and raw sunlight in, and you’ve cooked
every known terrestrial germ to a faretheewell. Lunar-native organisms, of
course, can’t infect human bodies. And as for playing dangerous pranks with
sabotage gadgets, this is literally unthinkable.

“Now when I’ve explained that, people usually say how odd it is to find the
staff of one of mankind’s most advanced scientific projects behaving more
like Bushmen than modern Americans. That is, if they’ve seen the point of my
earlier explanation.

“So I have to say no, it’s the reverse of odd, it’s a simple consequence of
the fact that the lunar environment contains a fixed number of variables.
Human beings can cope with big plain facts like seasons or lunar night and
day, like drought or vacuum, like a pestilence among the game animals they
feed off or a rocket going astray and crashing a load of provisions into a
mountainside. What we can’t cope with is seven billion competing members of
our own species. You have too many incalculable variables to make a rational
response when a crisis occurs.

“And one more thing, too. There’s no one on the moon who doesn’t know that
he’s making a contribution to the whole. Not a day goes past but you can
point to something you’ve done and say, ‘I achieved that today!’ It may be
physical, like adding an extension to the living accommodation, or it may be
intangible, like adding to our stock of stellar observations, but it’s
indescribably satisfying. These days, an urban psychiatrist here on Earth
thinks twice about handling a case with a rural background, but up there
I’ve been responsible for the mental welfare of people not only from
different countries but of different religions and different ideologies, and
I’ve never had a major problem from it.

“When I get this far people usually flinch and inquire nervously whether
that includes the little red brothers. And I can say nothing else except
that trying to subvert vacuum or a solar storm will get you one place and
that’s a grave.

“Of course I’m including Chinese! Like I said, I owe my life to a Chinese
colleague, a man we’d exchanged with the staff of the communist observatory
at Aristarchus. And down here in the middle of the Pacific, which apart from
Antarctica is the only part of the planet that you can compare to the Moon
for loneliness and lack of life-supports, all you can think of doing is
blasting each other. It makes me sick. Madam Chairman, somebody had better
get me a trank, and maybe then I’ll be able to get on with the cosy
tourist-type gossip I have down here in the rest of my notes. Right now I
don’t think I could read it without vomiting.”


Back on the road, Norman said, “And what would State think of
that—uh—presentation?”

“It was honest,” Gideon said with a shrug. “It’s hardly what they’ll hear
over the TV, but it’s honest.”

Norman hesitated. “There was something I wanted to ask, but it seems foolish
… The hole! Why was young Simon so eager to stress that he’d seen someone
lose his temper?”

“That’s a very bright kid. And sophisticated.”

“Anyone could see he’s no simpleton! But I asked—”

“He could say that in English. He couldn’t have said it in Shinka, which is
his native language, and that’s good for a boy barely into his teens, isn’t
it?”

Norman shook his head in bewilderment.

“Ask this linguist—what’s his name? The one you brought with you.”

“Derek Quimby.”

“Ah-hah. Ask him if you can express the idea of losing your temper in
Shinka. You can’t. You can only use the word which means ‘insane’.”

“But—”

“I’m telling you.” Gideon guided the car around a wide curve, seeking a
route between potholes. “I don’t speak the language well myself, but I can
get along. Facts are: you can say ‘annoyed’ or even ‘exasperated’, but both
those words came originally from roots meaning ‘creditor’. Someone you get
angry with owes you an apology in the same way you’re owed money or a cow.
You can say ‘crazy’ and put one of two modifiers on the front of it—either
the root for ‘amusing’ or the root for ‘tears’. In the latter case, you’re
talking about someone who’s hopelessly out of his mind, sick, to be tended
and cleaned up after. In the former, you’re inviting people to laugh at
someone who’s lost his temper, but will return to normal sooner or later.”

“They regard anger as being literal insanity?”

“They don’t regard it as being important enough to have a separate word to
label it, that’s all I can say.”

“But people must lose their tempers occasionally!”

“Of course they do. I’ve even seen Zad lose his temper. But that wasn’t at
anybody—it was the day his doctors told him he must retire or die. Did him a
power of good, too, like any catharsis. What they don’t do is go crazy-mad
and smash things that they’ll regret later. I’ve been here more than two
years and I haven’t seen a parent hit a child. I haven’t seen a child hit
another child. Trip him over, yes, or jump out at him from around a corner
and pretend to be a leopard. You know what the Mandingo used to say about
the Shinka in the old days?”

Norman gave a slow nod. “They were magicians who could steal the heart out
of a warrior.”

“Right. And the way they do it is by dodging passion. I don’t know how they
manage it, but there’s the record. A thousand or more years in the same
spot, not bothering anyone, and like I said the day you arrived they
swallowed up the Holaini and the Inoko and Kpala immigrants … Shall I tell
you something you really won’t believe?”

“You already did.”

“I mean really. Laying out that corpse and painting its face white reminded
me. The first Christian missionary to come here was a Spanish friar called
Domingo Rey. You know the Spanish had a trading post not far from Port Mey,
an outstation for Fernando Po? There’s a marker on the site you could go and
look at if you have time.

“Anyway, this friar did a very un-Christian thing. He went out of his mind
and drowned himself after he’d been here seven years. He was convinced he’d
been trapped by Satan. He’d learned enough Shinka to start preaching, and
started off with some of the parables and highlights of the gospel, and to
his dismay the people he talked to said no, you’ve got that wrong, it wasn’t
anyone far away called Jesus but our own man Begi who did that. You know
about Begi?”

“I don’t think I do,” Norman said after a pause.

“Any briefing on Beninia that leaves Begi out of account isn’t worth
having,” Gideon grunted. “I guess you’d call him a folk-hero, a sort of Jack
character, or maybe like this Anancy that you find in the West Indies. His
name apparently means ‘winter-born’, and they say he always used to carry a
blunt spear and a shield with a hole in it—to look through. And as you might
expect the stories about him were more to the Shinka taste than those about
Jesus.

“The one which allegedly drove the poor friar out of his skull—want to hear
it?”

“Sure, go ahead.”

Gideon eased the car down a particularly rutted stretch of road, avoiding
potholes. “Well, the stories say he’d reached a ripe old age and enormous
popular esteem because he’d made wizards look foolish and overcome a
sea-monster and even got the better of his grandfather’s ghost, so everybody
used to bring problems to him. And one time the boss Holaini, the Emir—which
the Shinka turned into ‘Omee’, incidentally, meaning ‘indigestion’; they
love bad puns—the Emir, anyway, got sick of the way the Shinka kept
outsmarting their lords and masters. Like for instance they’d imposed a
swingeing tax and people went to Begi and complained, and he said why don’t
you drive your fertile cows into the Holaini bull-pens and give them back
their own calves when you pay the tax? Which sort of tickled their sense of
humour. And, by the way, he said, according to the story, ‘Give the Emir
what belongs to the Emir!’”

“Render unto Caesar?” Norman muttered.

“You’ve hit it. So finally the Emir sent messengers to demand who was
playing these underhand tricks, and Begi owned up and off he went, and the
Emir pegged him out on an anthill in the traditional style. And when his old
blind father the chief came to visit him in his last moments, he said the
Shinka shouldn’t hold his death against the Holaini because they were too
stupid to see the point of what he had said to them.”

“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do?”

“Your being raised as a Baptist saves me explaining a lot of things to you,
doesn’t it? I guess if Friar Rey had been a bit more sophisticated he’d have
thought of the possibility that some Christian legends had reached here on
the grapevine, like the story of Buddha is supposed to have got to Rome and
led to his being canonised as St. Josaphat—you heard that one? But I guess
the climate of ideas wasn’t on his side in those days.

“Well, what it boils down to is that Begi already enshrined the Shinka
concept of a perfect man, tolerant, level-headed, witty—the whole shtick. It
wasn’t till some more broad-minded missionary hit on the notion of saying
that Begi was a prophet sent to the Shinka that Christianity made any
progress here. And nowadays you’ll hear Shinkas saying that Begi had better
sense than Jesus because he brought his teaching to people who understood
it, while Jesus overreached himself and preached to people like the British
who can’t have understood or they wouldn’t behave as they do.”

There was a period of silence except for the humming of the motor and
occasional complaints from the suspension. At last Norman said, “I told you
I’d never seen a dead body before. I don’t know how I could have said that.”
He swallowed enormously, his throat seeming to be blocked against the
admission he was trying to make. “Because … Well, the other day I killed
somebody.”

“What? Who?”

“A Divine Daughter. She took an axe to Shalmaneser. She’d already chopped
the hand off one of our technicians.”

Gideon thought that over. He said eventually, “There’s a Shinka proverb.”

“What?”

“You have many years to live—do things you will be proud to remember when
you’re old.”

*** MOTHER AND BABY DOING WELL?

“Hello, you out there, furious at the Eugenics Processing Board for denying
you the right to parenthood! Wouldn’t be so bad if paternalism were out of
fashion altogether, would it? But it’s inner than in. You put up with a
hundred and one things that are forbidden ‘for your own good’, and if
there’s anything you are allowed to do it’s probably for the good of the
people who could forbid it and don’t.

“I’m lucky, since they tell me I have a couple of good healthy
prodgies—matter of fact, they’ve both called me recently since they learned
I hadn’t returned my phosphorus to the planetary pool. Their calls set me
thinking about the chances I took when I started them on their merry way,
and some of the facts I’ve dug up are kind of scary. I mean, without a
computer analysis would you ordinarily do something that gave eight chances
out of a hundred of saddling you for ten, fifteen years—maybe for life—with
a greedy, demanding and stupid animal?

“Right. I’m talking about a subnormal child.

“Digging around, I came up with an estimate given to a reporter in Stockholm
in 1959 by Professor Linus Pauling, the man who hung a name and identity on
a disease called phenylketonuria. That’s the earliest place I’ve found the
hard, cold figure of eight per cent, and I’m too lazy to look any further
right now.

“Pauling said: approximately two of every hundred babies born in communities
for which records existed suffered from some kind of congenital disorder,
and the few studies which had at that time been continued to puberty
suggested the eventual total might run as high as eight. This would include
speech defects, alexia, colour-blindness and assorted other handicaps not
detectible by inspection of a new-born infant.

“Not all these, naturally, were hereditary. Many were the result of
intrauterine or natal trauma. The genotype of a spastic might be admirable.

“However, a barrel of dreck has been thrown down over the neat dividing line
between hereditary, due to the genes, and congenital, due to accident. None
of the experts, let alone members of the lay public, that I’ve talked to has
been able to agree on the cause of the difficult cases without an expensive
and time-consuming study of the parental germ-plasm.

“You see, traumata—which is Greek for ‘bruises’ but means outside
interference in this case—include the consequence of excessive exposure to
X-rays in the womb, infection of the mother with German measles, ingestion
of a carcinogenic or mutagenic substance which gets to the gonads,
hitripping on Yaginol while you’re pregnant—and that’s so addictive there
are some mothers-to-be you could write on with a hot iron, ‘It’ll deform
your baby!’ and they’d say get off my orbit, you’re crowding me down—and
additionally the gradual deposition in body-tissue of long-life radioactives
such as radio-strontium, radio-iodine, radio-caesium and radio-carbon … et
caetera.

“And these things have just about counteracted the advances in medical
science which have eliminated the traditional causes of spasticism. You
decide to have that kid, you’re still bucking an eight per cent risk that if
he reaches puberty he’ll suffer from a congenital disorder.

“Mark you, some of them are pretty minor. For instance, pollen-allergy is
hereditary, not congenital even, but modern antidotes make it possible for a
child with pollen-asthma to lead a fairly normal life. Sounds like nothing,
doesn’t it—these days?

“Except that before he dies that child will likely have spent seventy-five
thousand bucks on antidotes!

“Now if you’ve been turned down by the Eugenic Processing Board, what’s
happened is that they’ve assessed the risk of you having a handicapped child
not at eight but at eighty per cent. You may disagree with them on the
definition of a handicap—this recent row over dichromatism, for example.
They have solid achievements to their credit, though. Fifty years ago
Pauling said it would take twenty generations for all the recessives due to
radioactive fallout to appear; now, they have tabs on enough of them to say
they’ll be eliminated in fewer than twelve. That ought to cheer up your
ten-times-great-grandchildren, if any!

“But I tell you this, having looked at you for a good many years with the
maximum cynicism I could contrive. There’s nothing so good about you that it
deserves to be physically perpetuated in the body of your own born child.
You’re hiding behind that Eugenics Board decision to conceal the fact that
you’re really evading the responsibility of looking after a person who’s
eventually got to go and face the world alone. You don’t want to risk him
coming back and saying it was your fault he didn’t emerge a winner in the
game of life. I know some people, even, who are lying about their clean
genotype, pretending to a hereditary handicap to excuse their childless
state.

“Why can’t they be honest about it? I’m in favour of people who don’t breed,
mostly. But not because I prefer dogmatic homosexuals, or because I favour
religious fanatics like the Divine Daughters, who put on celibacy to mask
their borderline hysteria. No! Only because a person who doesn’t insist on
the expensive luxury of being a parent frees himself, or herself, to become
a parent for one of the underprivileged children we already have.

“If you’ve been forbidden to start a prodgy, you know there are potential
adoptees around who are superior to anything you could breed. Wouldn’t you
like to raise a child to be brighter than you are, more successful,
handsomer, sexier, healthier?

“No, you sheeting well wouldn’t. You’d prefer it to stay in a public
orphanage where substandard nutrition will reduce its intelligence and lack
of maternal affection will turn it into an unsuccessful neurotic.

“When a species becomes terrified of its own young, it appears to be
scheduled for the grand disposall down which went the dinosaurs. Some of us,
as I’ve just demonstrated, are afraid in case their prodgies will prove
inferior to themselves, which is halfway rational, but some are afraid
they’ll be the opposite, and that’s insane. Now you’re erecting an Asiatic
scientist you’d never heard of before a couple of weeks back into a
Messiah-figure. All right, suppose Sugaiguntung can do as they maintain and
tailor a baby to specification? What are you going to ask for?

“Cleverer than you? But you don’t want to spend your old age feeling you’re
a drag on your prodgies.

“Stupider than you? But you don’t want to waste the rest of your life
looking after a fool.

“What you want is one which is guaranteed to behave itself until it’s old
enough to run away from home, so that forever after you can complain about
the ingratitude it displayed. But I doubt whether even Sugaiguntung can
build that into an ovum with warranty of success.”

—From an article which an over-eager journal commissioned Chad Mulligan to
write when they realised he wasn’t after all dead

*** A FAVOURITE STORY OF CHAD MULLIGAN’S

“This very distinguished philosophy professor came out on the platform in
front of this gang of students and took a bit of chalk and scrawled up a
proposition in symbolic logic on the board. He turned to the audience and
said, ‘Well now, ladies and gentlemen, I think you’ll agree that that’s
obvious?’

“Then he looked at it a bit more and started to scratch his head and after a
while he said, ‘Excuse me!’ And he disappeared.

“About half an hour later he came back beaming all over his face and said
triumphantly, ‘Yes, I was right—it is obvious!’”


“How can you say that? It was the kind of important thing kids my age needed
to be told! Six wasn’t too young for me to have learned that the kid I liked
most on our block, the one I thought of as my best friend, was ready at a
minute’s notice to join with other kids I didn’t like and call me a dirty
nigger bastard.”

“Have you noticed you don’t hear that used so much any longer—that
particular insult? Probably you wouldn’t have. I notice the shifts in usage
because I spend years at a time out of the country, and the process has gone
quite a long way whenever I return. Nowadays where you used to say ‘bastard’
you tend to say ‘bleeder’ instead—to mean ‘haemophiliac’, I assume.”



“Right.” Elihu resumed his original position, elbows on chair-arms,
fingertips together. “A short while ago I remarked on something that
apparently struck you as irrelevant—the fact that you don’t hear people
calling each other ‘bastard’ so much any more. It’s important. To be born
out of wedlock doesn’t signify, any more than it did in slavery days when
our forefathers and mothers didn’t marry—they simply bred. What you do hear
used as an insult is a word that probably means ‘haemophiliac’. It matches
the preoccupations of our society; it’s become detestable, anti-social, to
have children if you’re carrying a harmful gene like that one. Are you on my
orbit now?”

“Things change,” Norman said.

“Exactly. You aren’t six years old any longer. A boss can’t do to his
subordinates what a long-ago white man did to your three times
great-grandfather. But is the world a paradise because of those truisms?”

“Paradise?”

“Of course not. Aren’t there enough problems to handle in present time, that
you should brood over ancient ones?”

“Yes, but—” Norman made a helpless gesture. “You don’t know what sort of a
dead end I’ve been lured down! I’ve been working on the current version of
myself for years, for decades! What am I to do?”

“That’s for you to work out.”

“It’s easy enough to say ‘work out’ the answer! You’ve been away from this
country for years at a time, you said so yourself. You don’t know what The
Man is like, even nowadays—you don’t know how he leans on you all the time,
needles you, goads you. You just haven’t experienced my life.”

“I guess that’s a fair comment.”

“For example…” Norman gazed without seeing at the wall behind Elihu’s head.
“Heard of a woman called Guinevere Steel?”

“I gather she’s responsible for the mechanical styles women are affecting
here at the moment, as though they were built in a factory and not born of a
mother.”

“Right. She’s planning to hold a party. It’ll be a microcosm of what I mean,
all there in the one apartment and dripping slime. I should drag you along
with me, and then perhaps you’d—”

He stopped in mid-sentence, suddenly appalled at what he was saying and who
he was saying it to.

“Mr. Masters, I’m dreadfully sorry! I have no business to talk to you this
way!” Rising to his feet, covered in embarrassment. “I ought to be thanking
you very sincerely for your tolerance, and here I am insulting you and…”

“Sit down,” Elihu said.

“What?”

“I said sit down. I haven’t finished, even if you have. Do you feel you owe
me anything?”

“Of course. If I hadn’t been able to talk to somebody tonight, I think I’d
have gone insane.”

“How well you express my feelings,” Elihu said with ponderous irony. “May I
take it that right now you aren’t excessively concerned with GT’s company
secrets remaining inviolate?”

“I know too damned well that they aren’t.”

“I’m sorry?” Elihu blinked.

“A private problem … Oh, why try and hide it? The shiggy I’ve been keeping
around lately turned out this evening to be an industrial spy; my roomie
discovered an eavesdropping gadget hidden in a polyorgan she brought with
her.” Norman gave a harsh laugh. “Anything you want to know, just ask—I can
always claim she was the one who got away with the secret.”

“I’d rather you told me openly if you tell me at all.”

“Yes, I shouldn’t have said that. Go ahead.”

“What do GT’s people think is my purpose in approaching them?”

“I don’t know. No one has told me.”

“Have you figured it out for yourself?”

“Not exactly. I was talking about it with my roomie earlier this evening.
But we didn’t reach any definite conclusion.”

“Well, suppose I were to say my intention is to sell my dearest friend into
slavery to The Man, and that I believe it’s for his own good—what then?”

Norman’s mouth rounded slowly into an O. He snapped his fingers. “President
Obomi?” he said.

“You’re a very intelligent man, Mr. House. Well—your verdict?”

“But what have they got that GT might want?”

“It isn’t GT as such. It’s State.”

“Not willing to risk another Isola-type crisis?”

“You’re beginning to amaze me, and I’m not joking.”

Norman looked uncomfortable. “To be frank, it was one of the ideas my roomie
and I were tossing around. If I hadn’t heard it from yourself, though, I’d
never have credited it.”

“Why not? GT’s annual profit is almost fifty times the gross national
product of Beninia; they could buy and sell many of the underdeveloped
countries.”

“Yes, but even granting their ability to do it, which I can’t contest, the
question remains: what is there in Beninia that GT might want?”

“A twenty-year rehabilitation project that will create an advanced
industrial bridgehead in West Africa, serviced by the best port on the Bight
of Benin, able to compete on their own terms and on their own ground with
the Dahomalians and the RUNGs. State has a computer analysis which suggests
that the intervention of a third force is the only factor likely to prevent
a war over Beninia when my good friend Zad dies—and that day can’t be as far
off as I’d like it to be. He’s working himself into his grave.”

“And this will belong to GT?”

“It’ll be—mortgaged to GT, let me put it that way.”

“Then don’t do it.”

“But if the alternative is war—?”

“From the inside, from the status of a junior VP in the corporation, I say
that war itself isn’t as foul as what GT can do to a man’s self-respect.
Listen!” Norman leaned forward earnestly. “Do you know what they’ve duped me
into doing? I subscribe to these Genealogical Research outfits, these
near-crank businesses which claim to trace your descent on the basis of your
genotype. And do you know I haven’t commissioned one to track my Afram
heritage? I don’t know where my black ancestors came from to within two
thousand miles!”

“And supposing it’s a cousin of yours—and mine—who gives the order and the
armies march into Beninia! What’s going to be left of the country? The loser
is going to scorch the earth behind him when he retreats, and there will be
nothing left except rubble and corpses!”

Norman’s intensity faded. He shrugged and nodded. “I guess you’re right.
We’re all human beings, after all.”

“Let me tell you the scheme. GT will float a loan to finance the operation,
and State will buy a fifty-one percent interest through front agents—mainly
African banks. GT will guarantee five per cent per annum for the twenty-year
period of the project, and publish estimates of a yield in excess of eight
per cent. That’s solidly based, by the way, on State’s computations; when
they give the data to Shalmaneser they expect it to be confirmed. Then
they’ll recruit the teaching staff, mainly among people who were colonial
administrators and so on in the old days, people who are used to West
African conditions. The first three years will go on diet, sanitation and
building. The next decade will go on training—a literacy drive first, then a
technical education programme designed to make eighty per cent of the
population of Beninia into skilled workers. I see you’re looking
incredulous, but I say I believe this will work. There’s no other country in
the world where you could bring it off, but in Beninia you can. And the last
seven years will go to build the factories, install the machine-tools,
string the powerlines, level the roads—everything else, in short, to leave
Beninia as the most advanced country on the continent, South Africa not
excepted.”

“Allah be merciful,” Norman said softly. “But where do you get the power to
feed into the lines?”

“It’s going to be tidal, solar, and deep-sea thermal. Mainly the latter. The
temperature gradient between the surface and the sea-bed at those latitudes
could apparently run a whole country much larger than Beninia.”

Norman hesitated. “In that case,” he ventured at length, “the raw materials
will presumably be coming from MAMP?”

A new cordiality entered Elihu’s manner. “As I said before, Mr. House, you
suddenly astonish me. When we met earlier today your—ah—superficial image
was so flawless as to conceal from me this sort of perceptivity. Yes, that’s
going to be the carrot with which we coax the GT donkey into agreement: the
promise of a built-in market that will enable them to put the MAMP mineral
deposits to work.”

“On the basis of what you’ve told me,” Norman said, “I presume they jumped
at the idea.”

“You’re the first person at GT to hear the full details.”

“The—? But why?” Norman’s question was almost a cry.

“I don’t know.” Elihu seemed suddenly weary. “I guess because I’d kept it to
myself too long, and you were here when it broke loose. Shall I call Miss
Buckfast and tell her I want you sent to Port Mey to conduct the initial
negotiations?”

“I—wait a moment! What makes you so sure she’ll consent when you haven’t
even explained the project to her?”

“I’ve met her,” Elihu said. “And I only need to meet someone once to know if
this is the sort of person who’d like to own nine hundred thousand slaves.”

*** ISOLATION

“At bottom the human species finds idealism an uncomfortable posture. Prime
evidence of this can be found in the way neither of the two groups locked in
irresoluble conflict around the Pacific has been able to achieve its stated
goal—even though, given the lucid, simple, obviously attractive statement of
either of their ideals, an impartial observer might wonder why commitment
had not ensued like sunrise after night.

“‘Give the wealth back to the people who created it!’ Here’s an ideal
capable of generating crusades among people who interpret it as
expropriating greedy landlords, sharing out land so that every family may
enjoy reasonable nutrition and repudiating debts to moneylenders at usurious
rates of interest. Having hit on this, the Chinese charged ahead—until they
overreached themselves. They became unable to distinguish between the evils
they were preaching against and those traditional influences which literally
constituted the way of life of people they hoped to recruit to their cause.
In short order they fell into the same pit as their rivals, who had for
decades ignored the plain and simple fact that to a starving man ‘freedom’
implies a full rice-bowl—or, if he has an exceptional imagination, a healthy
ox to pull his plough. It has nothing to do with voting for a political
delegate.

“Analogously with the way the Tsarist army deserted en masse during the
First World War, not because of Bolshevik impact on the soldiers but because
they were sick of fighting and wanted to go tend their farms, the eager
early recruits to the red flag discovered that while they were dying abroad
the things they wanted to guard were being undermined at home. So they quit.
China, like Russia before her, found she was surrounded by a gaggle of heirs
to the mantle of the late Marshal Tito, not a few of whom were themselves
within China’s boundary.

“However, by that time, thanks to ineptitude, racial prejudice against them,
fighting the right wars with the wrong weapons, and general mismanagement of
their affairs, the opposition (or if you prefer, which I don’t because I’d
rather not identify with such a bunch of incompetents, ‘our side’) was so
far in arrears that the greatest single territorial gain to date in a
contest which bids fair to outdo the Hundred Years’ War both for duration
and for inconclusiveness only restored a rough balance and didn’t tip the
scales the other way.

“We can’t even claim in honesty that it was the result of foresight and
planning—only that when the grabbing was good, we grabbed. Don’t believe
anyone who tries to claim that the existence of Isola is proof of the
superiority of the Western system. The Chinese couldn’t have taken over.
There was no form of discontent they could have exploited. How do you whip
up resentment against absentee landlords and pocketers of bribes when the
highest ambition of the people concerned is either to become the former or
be in a position to receive the latter?

“Life in the Philippines had become intolerable well before the civil war of
the 1980s. The state of things obtaining (which some accounts misname
anarchy, but which any decent dictionary will tell you was nothing of the
sort, but free-enterprise capitalism gone out of its skull) was on the verge
of ruining the country permanently. The annual average of unsolved murders
was running around 30,000 in a population of under fifty million. In the
eyes of the inhabitants of the Sulu Archipelago, where most of them were
committed, the offence for which they revolted against and ultimately
assassinated President Sayha was that he interfered in their traditional
right to slaughter and steal. This was unforgivable.

“Oh, doubtless there were some among the people who gave that celebrated
majority of eighty-eight per cent in the plebiscite on secession who hoped
that being policed and governed by Big Brother in Washington would ensure
them a quieter life, free them from the need to fit bullet-proof shutters
and plant man-traps in their gardens. Far more, however, seem to have hoped
that the bait on the hook (full States’ rights and a billion dollars of aid)
would offer another and fatter cake of which they could snatch their slice.

“Which of these parties saw its dream fulfilled? Dear reader, you must be
joking. That vaunted billion-dollar aid budget went nowhere near the
natives’ pockets. It was spent on roads, airfields, port facilities and
fortifications. And, while it’s true that the smugglers and black-marketeers
who had hitherto rampaged unchecked had their hinder ends smartly kicked, to
get rid of them the new owners imposed martial law and it hasn’t been lifted
since 1991!

“Dubbed ‘Isola’ on the grounds that Montana was a mountainous territory and
the new acquisition was an island territory, the Junior State went from the
frying-pan into the fire. However, the Americans had been desperately in
need of bases closer to the Asian mainland than what they currently had, and
they were reasonably well satisfied.

“The Chinese, on the other hand, when they tried a counterstroke by wooing
Yatakang, were disappointed. The Yatakangi are descendants of the former
dominant people in South-East Asia and firm believers in the traditional
military dictum that the first thing you do after contracting an alliance is
prepare plans for the day when your ally welshes on you. Just because
they’re Asiatics it doesn’t follow that they’re going to invite their yellow
fellows into their beds. Nor, because they haven’t performed the Peking
kotow, should it be assumed (as some blockbottoms I know in Washington have
assumed) that they are all set to become the second Isola. Why should they?
Things are peachy down in Yatakang; it’s among the world’s great nations, by
Asian standards it’s fabulously wealthy, and it can enjoy the game of
playing off Washington against Peking until doomsday, on present evidence.

“Until doomsday? Well, perhaps that’s a slight exaggeration. There’s one
bright spot in the generally gloomy picture known as the Pacific Conflict
Zone. According to my calculations, by the year 2500 or so we should have
killed off every last member of our species who is stupid enough to take
part in so futile a pastime as this war between ‘ideals’, and with luck they
won’t have left their genes behind because they’ll typically have been
killed at an age when society thinks they’re too young to assume the
responsibility of childbearing. And after that we may get some peace and
quiet for a change.”

—Better ? than ? by Chad C. Mulligan

“People who feel the need to foul up their perceptions with hop or Yaginol
or Skulbustium simply aren’t turned on to the essential truth that the real
world can always be identified by its unique characteristic: it, and it
only, can take us completely by surprise.

“Take two lumps of greyish metal and bring them together. Result: one
wrecked city.

“Could anyone have predicted or envisaged that until they knew enough about
the real world to calculate the properties of a substance called
Uranium-235?

“People are going around marvelling at the fact that there’s a solid
scientific basis for palmistry. Anybody with a grain of intelligence could
have said, directly the notion of the genetic code was formulated, that
there was no a priori reason why the pattern of the folds in the palm should
not be related to a person’s temperament by way of an association of genes
sharing the same chromosome. Indeed, there were all kinds of reasons for
assuming this actually was so, because we aren’t totally stupid—as I’ve
pointed out before—and unless there was in palmistry some element of
relevance to real experience we’d have given it up and gone chasing some
other will-o’-the-wisp. There’s no shortage of them.

“But it took forty years for someone to conduct a properly rigorous study of
the subject and demonstrate that the suspicion was well-founded. This I do
find remarkable—or disheartening might be a better word.

“All right: what should you be surprised at, these days?

“The fact that, having learned so much about ourselves—the designs on our
palms being just one example of the way we’ve analysed ourselves down to the
constituent molecules, so that we can claim to be in sight of the day when
we won’t merely be able to ensure the sex of our offspring (if we can afford
the fee) but also to choose whether we’ll have a math genius in the family,
or a musician, or a moron (some people might like to breed a moron for a
pet, I guess…)—having got to this state, then, we know less about our
reactions in the mass than we do about the behaviour of non-human things
like a lump of U-235.

“Or maybe it’s not so amazing. Without being totally stupid, we do display a
tremendous aptitude for it.”

nothing from history. I know people who can’t even learn from what happened

—The Hipcrime Vocab by Chad C. Mulligan)


She found the intruder confronting Danny-boy, her chief usher—him of the
Parisian artist’s smock—and growling belligerently. Fortunately, to call it
“shouting” was an exaggertion, so the customers in even the nearest posts
were unlikely to have noticed anything wrong. Moreover the blonde member of
the come-hither team had shown enough presence of mind to move the
changeochrome partition so it screened the disgusting stranger from outside.

He was a hulking man, well over six feet, and probably strong in spite of
his revolting condition. His hair hung in lank strands all over his collar
and merged into a beard and moustache that might as well never have been
trimmed, but served as a soup-filter and catch-all for scraps of food. There
was a singed indentation in the right lower edge of the moustache as though
from smoking hand-rolled joints to the last fraction of a roach. His
sweaterette had once been red but was now patched, smeared and streaked with
other colours, and if his slax had ever fitted him that must have been years
ago; now the waistband had given up struggling against the encroachment of
his belly. His feet were planted four-square on her lovely hand-inlaid floor
in things that might have been loafers but now were incrustations of garbage
totally concealing any fabric that might separate dirt from skin.

He broke off his tirade at Guinevere’s approach. “Ah!” he exclaimed. “You
must be Steely Gwin from Port of Sin—I’ve heard such a lot about you! I even
wrote a poem about you once. Just a second … Ah yes—‘Girls made up by
Guinevere Steel Look a treat but are lousy to feel. She turns meat that was
cute Into plasticised fruit With the juices locked under the peel.’ One of
those shiggies called you Danny-boy, didn’t she?” he added to the quaking
usher. “That should make you feel right at home, then. Limericks are Irish
too.” He hee-hawed with laughter and rocked on his heels.

“Want to hear another? ‘If you fancy a shiggy and seize her, And find she’s
as cold as Teresa, She isn’t a freak, It’s because the Beautique—’”

Guinevere said with all the dignity she could command, “What do you want in
here?”

“Whatinole do you think I want? One of your window-display dummies?” He
gestured with black-tipped fingers at the cowering come-hither girls.
“Thanks, if I need an inflatable masturbator I’ll build my own. Ah,
whatinole do you think somebody wants who comes into a place like this?”

“You must be drunk or orbiting,” Guinevere snapped. “I don’t believe you
know where you are.” She cast a nervous glance at the wall-clock. The
current hour’s appointments were nearly up, and if the clients were to
emerge and see this revolting specimen blocking their exit … “Danny-boy,
you’ll have to call the police. I don’t see anything else for it.”

“What for?” the stranger demanded in an aggrieved tone. “What do I do? All I
want is to be beautified.”

“To be what?” Guinevere said. Her breath ran out on the third word. “You
must be insane! We don’t accept male clients anyway, let alone—let alone
objects like you!”

“No?” The intruder took a threatening pace closer to her. “New York State
Code provisions on discrimination, any commercial establishment offering a
service to the general public and declining to accept a prospective client
on racial, linguistic, religious or sexual grounds shall forthwith have its
licence revoked!”

Belatedly Guinevere realised that the man neither spoke nor acted as she
felt would match his appearance.

“In any case I know perfectly well you don’t discriminate. Apart from
Danny-boy—and you’re not going to tell me he doesn’t get you to help him
with that impeccable surface sheen!—my old beddy Doll Clark has been coming
here for years and he still has his balls. What do you want I should do?
Come back in a kilt wagging my hips?”

Guinevere said, with a faint sensation of unreality as though someone had
slipped her a cap of Yaginol, “I can ask for proof of ability to pay, at
least. And if you could meet my rates you wouldn’t be walking around
stinking like”—she borrowed Danny-boy’s simile because it was definitive—“a
whole barrel of whaledreck!”

“Oh, if credit is all that’s eating on you—!” The stranger made a face.
“Here!”

He reached inside his sweaterette and produced a thick wad of documents.
Flipping through them like a dealer riffling a new deck of cards, he
extracted one and held it out.

“That do?”

“Hold it so I can read it,” Guinevere snapped. “I don’t want to touch it, or
you.”

She looked. It was a bank credit authorisation good for a thousand dollars
at sight of bearer. But that wasn’t what shook her to the core. It was the
name neatly printed across the bottom, under the picture of a much younger
man with his moustache and beard trimmed into Louis-Napoleon elegance.

“But he’s dead!” she said faintly. “Danny-boy! Surely Chad C. Mulligan is
dead!”

“Who?” Danny-boy looked blank for a moment. Then: “Did you say Chad
Mulligan?”

“Dead?” said the filthy stranger. “Christ, no. And if you make me stand
around much longer I’ll prove it conclusively. Come on, come on!”

The clock crept towards the final five minutes of the current session. Any
second now the first of the clients being attended to would leave the
shelter of the curtains. Guinevere swallowed hard. Which of her assistants
could be persuaded to handle this job for a hundred-dollar bonus?

“Danny-boy,” she whispered, “take Mr. Mulligan in charge and do whatever he
wants.”

“But, Gwinnie—!”

“Do as I tell you!” She stamped her foot.

After all, he is a considerable celebrity …

Forcing herself to overcome her nausea, she said, “Forgive me, won’t you,
Mr. Mulligan? But—well, this is rather an incongruous guise to find you in!”

“Incongruous my insalubrious hole,” Chad Mulligan grunted. “It’s the same
way I’ve been looking for the past two years or more. What I’m going to find
incongruous is what I’ll be like after your mechanics have overhauled me.
But I’m giving up. I’m quitting. The sheer God-blasted inertia of this
asinine species has defeated me. I can’t make people pay me attention
whether I argue, or bellow, or daub myself with shit. I propose to pretty
myself up and join the rest of you Gadarene swine in debauching myself
magnificently to death. All right, where do you want to put me so your other
customers won’t see the state I’m in?”

And he added over his shoulder as Danny-boy led him away: “Send someone out
for a quart of liquor, will you? I need something to nerve me for this.”


*** BE KIND TO YOUR FORFEITED FRIENDS

LOCALE: since it was illegal by city ordinance to occupy that much space by
herself what Guinevere had done was to make a settlement on her husband whom
she was divorcing largely because his name was Dwiggins and get him to buy
with it the vacant apartment below her penthouse and then lease it to her
for an indefinite period at a peppercorn rent which was not illegal and the
chief method by which the ostentatiously wealthy in the modern super-crowded
city secured for themselves that ultimate in contemporary status symbols a
home many times larger than one person could reasonably require—to wit two
rooms one above the other forty-eight feet by thirty-two, two (ditto) thirty
by eighteen, two (ditto) twenty-one by eighteen, four bathrooms en suite and
two not, four additional toilets, two kitchen-eateries, and a roof-garden
which Guinevere had had as it were hollowed out by an ingenious architect so
that it became a bower with its main level corresponding to the lower
apartment and the upper containing the automatic watering and fertilising
sprays together with the artificial sunlight lamps required to keep the
plants and flowers healthy.

CONTENTS (PERMANENT): the largest unit-based suite of polyform furniture
ever manufactured for a private customer including large tables convertible
into desks or screens and small tables convertible into book-racks or
trolleys and chairs upright convertible into chairs relaxing and chairs
relaxing convertible into lounges and lounges convertible into sofas and
sofas convertible into beds and beds convertible for single or double or
multiple occupation and so on—in theory capable of adapting the apartment
for everything from a well-attended political meeting with everyone sitting
around paying serious attention to the subject in hand to a party like the
present one with everyone paying serious attention to the subject hoped to
be in hand eventually.

CONTENTS (TRANSIENT IMMOBILE NON-PERISHABLE): the latest decorations and
pictures and ornaments and models of phone and TV and polyformer and
holographic record reproducer and cosmoramic projector and even books—though
the latter were hanging in the balance as potentially non-fashionable.

CONTENTS (TRANSIENT IMMOBILE PERISHABLE): an assortment of seven dozen
different kinds of foodstuffs guaranteed by the catering company to be
accurately twentieth-century in substance and appearance but not necessarily
in flavour—certain essential compounds in such items as free-ranged chicken
and slow-smoked bacon being no longer reproducible under modern
manufacturing conditions—plus bottles and cases and barrels and boxes and
jars and cans and packs of liquor and incense and wine and marijuana and
beer and even tobacco to give the guests a decadent life-in-my-hands thrill
that would also be properly in period.

CONTENTS (TRANSIENT MOBILE BUT IN A SENSE EQUALLY PERISHABLE): a hundred
fifty people including the hostess and her guests and many human staff from
the catering company which had a good reputation among the new poor of the
happening world for concealing payments to waiters and cleaners by inflating
their charges for purchase of goodies and thus enabling them to escape the
moonlighting tax supposed to wipe out the profit a fully-supported recipient
of welfare might derive from odd jobs like these.

EXCUSE AND REASON: making the guests pay forfeits which if she chose she
could make so hideously embarrassing the victims would never want to see her
again.

COST: about three thousand dollars.

VALUE RECEIVED: that would have to wait until the end of the party to be
assessed.

Click and cram the elevators cycling, splash and crash the guzzling well

AUDIO: the most bearable re-made recordings from the latter part of last
century, not the most recent (stuff from the nineties was intolerably
vieux-jeu). No, it had to be from the seventies, endowed now with a certain
quaint charm, and on top of that it had to be the kind of music which led
most directly to what was currently acceptable in the real world
outside—chants sans paroles in the rather bland monotonous rhythms of five
against four and seven against eight. The quality of the recordings was
lousy and the divisible-by-two rhythms seemed banal and boring after
subtleties like five against eleven. But each of the records allegedly had
sold a million.

If someone comes in wearing Arpège Twenty-first Scentury or anything else
like that what shall I make her—or him—do?

COSMORAMIC: mostly the fashionable colours of the nineties because they were
currently bearable—apple-green, sour lemon-yellow, and the inevitable pale
blues—but changeochrome was newer than the century and there wasn’t a moiré
setting on the projector which would have been marginally allowable, so it
was all stark flat colours and rather drab.

Come to think of it, that stuff of Mel Ladbroke’s is new, so what if someone
drecky claims forfeit off him for bringing it? The hole; it’s my party and I
say what’s allowed.

GUSTATORY: likely to be the biggest success of the party, no whistlers or
moonjuice or any other this-very-instant drinks, but that weird cocktail
chart dug up from about 1928 and programmed specially into the
consoles—things called “Old-Fashioned” and “Bosom-Caresser” ought to appeal
if only for their amusing silly names. Also the food exotic. Out of period,
but absolutely unavoidable, generous supplies of antalc, disgorgeant and
counter-agents to the most popular lifters, Yaginol, Skulbustium and
Triptine. Not permitted at the party, all too new, all post-turn-of-century,
but people would certainly turn up orbiting on one or two or maybe all of
them.

Snff…? That’s Dior Catafalque, I swear it is! Whereinole did she dredge it
up? It’s been off the market for twenty years! Make a point of asking her
what it is; recognising it would date me …

SARTORIAL: the most incredible, the most phenomenal mish-mash assembled
under one roof this generation except maybe in the General Assembly of the
UN.

That girl’s wearing Nipicaps. I can tell—who better? Bit early to start
imposing forfeits but that will be a lovely lovely start. Something
mild—after all, they’re one of my own products—but something forceful enough
to make people realize I mean business. One moment: girl? That’s no shiggy!
Well, that forfeit defines itself, doesn’t it? Yum!



1969: the hostess in an outfit of PVC which was about as near as they were
coming in those days to the stark sleek mechanical styles of the current
trend, regrettably needing to be underpinned with the badly engineered and
somewhat uncomfortable brassière and girdle appropriate to it—a discovery
she had made too late, not having obtained and tried on the costume until it
was too close to the start of the party to change her mind. But at least the
slick surface was a kind of foreshadowing of 2010; she hated the idea of fur
or velvet or one of those other crudely textured fabrics women used to stuff
themselves into.

“My dear, haven’t seen you in lightyears! That’s a most marvellous rig
you’re sailing under—did it belong to your grandmother?”

19??: Norman House in a full set of jet-black evening dress with a genuine
stiff shirt and white bow-tie and even shoes of that revolting stuff called
“patent leather”—a hundred per cent genuine to judge from the cracks in
them. Guinevere gave him a venomous smile for not allowing her an instant
opening for attack and wished that he didn’t look so inarguably magnificent
in the sombre garb.

“You mean this is really tobacco? Cigarettes of that stuff that was supposed
to cause so much cancer? My dear, I must try some—my parents didn’t smoke it
ever and I hardly believe I saw the stuff before!”

1924: Sasha Peterson in a softly draped tea-gown of semi-translucent chiffon
hanging almost to her ankles but slashed behind to the waist, invoking an
old-fashioned air called “elegance”. Guinevere thought of what the
mode-masters were saying about a swing back to a more natural look in
shiggies and wished she had never dreamed up this sheeting party.

“Well, if I can’t have a whistler whatinole can I have? Oh, give me some
bourbon on the rocks, then—I take it that’s allowed? I mean, if they had
cold drinks at the court of Emperor Nero they had them in the last century?”

1975: a very young shiggy with a beautiful bosom wearing a niltop over a
minisarong. Can’t legislate for that—any girl who’s recently discovered that
her body attracts men will go the available limit to display it to them.

“Are we not even supposed to talk about the real scene? I mean, I don’t know
whatinole people did talk about at parties in the last century—I wasn’t old
enough to go to them.

1999 and only scraping under the limit by a chronological accident: Donald
Hogan in a curiously antique-seeming brown and green totalsuit with a spiral
zipper going from right ankle twice around to the left shoulder, face
flushed and apparently worried about something but ascribing it for official
purposes to the fact that if Norman hadn’t remembered to book him whatever
was available from the rental agency he’d have had to turn up in the only
universally acceptable costume—his skin.

“I shouldn’t hope for too much, darling. All tobacco ever did to me was make
me throw up. I don’t know whatinole people used it for. No, darling, you
can’t take it in like the smoke from a joint, you have to sort of puff it in
straight and then accustom yourself to inhaling it without dilution.”

1982 or thereabouts: a positive travesty in the literal sense, in one of
these ghastly outfits with five or six layers of mesh in contrasting colours
hanging from the hips and shoulders, and shoes of enormous size sticking out
below.

“One of the reasons I come to Gwinnie’s parties is she doesn’t feel
obligated to ask all these sheeting brown-noses you keep treading on
everywhere else, but there are too many of them here for my liking tonight!”


Right. Find out who they are and why.



“Of course the whole thing is sheeting crazy. That was the wildest
roller-coaster of a century the human race has ever lived through, if you
can call it living—hey, notice that good in-period catchphrase I used?”

Any time: Elihu Masters in a regal suit of Beninian robes, a loose
red-and-white top over baggy pants and open sandals his round balding head
framed in a kind of crown of upright feathers varnished into brown rigidity
around a velvet skullcap.

“Yes, but what kind of a twentieth-century party? One of those stiff soirées
you read about in old magazines dating back to 1901, or something right up
close to our own day like a Sexual Freedom League meeting? I don’t know
whatinole I’m supposed to be doing and Gwinnie has that forfeit light in her
eye. Maybe it’s safest to tag along after her and be in the support group
when she picks on someone.”

1960: Chad Mulligan perspiring in a hound’s-tooth check tweed suit which was
all the costume rental agency had left in his size when he shrugged and let
Guinevere persuade him to attend.

“Yes, of course I’m nervous. I hate to miss these parties of Gwinnie’s
because normally I make out fine and she’s never picked on me yet, but this
time I’m violating the conditions so flagrantly—I mean, this isn’t a
last-century costume, it’s all I could dig out from my father’s wardrobe and
it says right on the label ‘Summer collection 2000’ but there wasn’t
anything older.”

1899: an incredible multi-caped garment vainly hauled in around a large
waist and a skirt dangling to the ground and a silly bonnet on top of it all
and the excuse prepared that there was no reason in those days why a dress
shouldn’t have been worn for two years or even longer.

“When Gwinnie gets really nasty I’m going to blast off. I know another party
which ought to be humming by then.”

Any time: Gennice, Donald’s one-time shiggy, in a minor stroke of genius, an
undatable Japanese happi-coat and traditional slippers to match.

“Must have been funny living in those days. I know someone who rebuilds and
runs cars for a hobby, for instance, but for all he can do to the—what’s it
called? Exhaust?—they stink worse than a barrel of whaledreck. Makes my eyes
water just to go near one when he’s got it running!”

1978: Horace, a friend of Norman’s, in a ventilated parka with contrasting
hood over jodhpurs, a perfect memorial to the way men’s fashions were going
over the edge into pure schizophrenia in that hysterical epoch.



SITUATION: a lot of people drifting about and looking each other over
covertly or sometimes overtly, knotting gradually into groups of former
acquaintances separated by strands of people who never met before and who
haven’t yet softened their self-consciousness to the point of blending in.
In short, as was probably the case in Pharaonic Egypt where they first
established the tradition of giving parties, a party that hasn’t jelled.



“That’s a very curious perfume you’re wearing, darling.”

Nervous laugh. “Of course, you’re an expert on that, aren’t you? Do you like
it? It’s a bit musty, isn’t it? It’s something called Dior Catafalque that
my mother gave me when she heard I was coming to your party.”

“Catafalque? Really? Isn’t that the thing they lay out corpses on when
they’re lying in state?”

“Yes—I think that’s the idea. It’s supposed to be sort of musty and
decaying.” Shudder. “Actually it’s pretty horrible, but it is in period,
isn’t it?”

“Goodness, I wouldn’t know for certain. I’ll take your word for it, though.”



SITUATION: same.



“Don! Don!”

“Oh—hullo, Gennice. Nice to see you again.”

“Don, this is Walter that I’m living with now—Don Hogan that I was with
before, Walter. Don, you don’t look as if you’re enjoying yourself at all.”

It shows that much? But they said keep on with your ordinary life until you
leave, so … Wish I had the guts to back down. I’m frightened!

“I need a lift, I think. Don’t suppose Guinevere would approve, though.”

“There’s plenty of pot. And someone did say that that codder there—I think
the name’s Ladbroke—was from Bellevue. He may have something.”



SITUATION: same.



“You’re Chad Mulligan? Prophet’s beard, I thought you were dead!”

“Might as well be. Intend to be. Just think I might as well take a lazy
man’s way out. Get me another drink.”

“Elihu, here’s a man you ought to meet! I saw one of his books in your room
when I called the other night!”



SITUATION: same.


“I say, someone told me you were from Bellevue and … Oh. Excuse me. I just
saw somebody I know.”

“Yes, that’s right. My name’s Schritt—Mister—Helmut Schritt.” A quick glance
around and an insincere smile. “Routine precaution. There’s a vanishing
chance that someone might try to foul up your—uh—business along the lines I
recall being mentioned last time we met. Act as normally as you can and
avoid any entanglements that would prevent you leaving a bit earlier than
the mass, okay?”

“Act normally!”

“That’s what I said. Like keep your voice down when you talk about
the—uh—subject of importance, hm?” Another of the insincere smiles.



SITUATION: same.



“Darling, that’s a wild rig you’re sailing under!”

“Gwinnie, I’m so glad you like it!”

“But aren’t those Nipicaps a trifle out of period…?”



Sudden tension. A personal silence for all the screaming of the records in
the background. A shifting of several of Guinevere’s closest sparewheels to
encircle the victim and savour the inaugural forfeit of the evening.

“I—uh—I…”

“Well, I mean, I should know, darling, since I have them made specially for
the Beautique and sell them by the literally thousands! And they only made
their splash two years ago.”

“Forfeit!” someone said decisively, and there were grins.

“Ye-es, I think so. And it sort of writes itself, doesn’t it? Take it off,
darling, from there”—shoulder—“to there”—waist.

Sickly embarrassed but complying: result, the strange hermaphrodite. Scalp
to neck, elaborate coiffure, immaculately painted face with eyebrows arched
and lashes lengthened and lips clear red and earrings jangling; waist to
floor, skirt and hose and jewelled 1988-style boots; between them, that
incongruous bare male chest with good solid muscle and hair in concentric
curves swirling out from the nipples.

“I think that’ll do nicely,” Guinevere said with satisfaction, and those
around chortled and clapped her and each other on the back and those as yet
out of range of her decisions relaxed and began to chatter loudly again.



SITUATION: same but with an admixture of high nervous laughter.


“Darling, of course I’m only really well grounded in feminine fashions, but
I do seem to detect something a teeny bit incongruous in that outfit you’re
wearing…?”

“Well”—swallow hard—“ah … as a matter of fact—”

“Darling, don’t prevaricate. You know how much I detest prevarication.”

“Forfeit! Forfeit!”

“Well, Gwinnie dear, it’s as old as I could lay hands on, honestly it is.”

“No doubt, darling, but you’ve been to lots of my parties and I’m sure
you’ve had as much fun out of seeing other people pay forfeits as they’re
going to get out of you. Now let’s see. What would be appropriate? Bearing
in mind that it’s early yet, so because of that and because we like you a
whole great slobbering lot we’ll want to keep it a mild one, won’t we?”



SITUATION: less laughter, more tension.



“Sadistic bitch, isn’t she?”

“You should see her when she gets on to an Afram, Mr. Mulligan.”

“If you call me ‘Mr. Mulligan’ one more time I’ll throw this liquor all over
your smart period-piece.” Gulp. “Cancel that—I’ll break the glass on your
ought-to-be-nappy skull. Anyway, she’s wrong.”

“What?”

“She’s wrong. But that’s irrelevant, I guess. If that’s the way her guests
like her to run her parties I’ll just sit quietly here and give thanks to
any deity who may exist that I ran into intelligent company. Elihu, I’d like
to know something more about this place Beninia. There are some highly
anomalous factors in what you’ve been telling me—”

“Excuse me, Chad, please. How did you mean, ‘she’s wrong’?”

“Norman, you do have eyes, hm? And you’re blessed with a reliable memory,
hm? The hole, then! What were you wearing in the summer of 2000? Something
like that, I’ll wager.”

“The summer of—? Prophet’s beard, of course! I’m an idiot.”

“You belong to an idiotic species. I even wrote a book to draw attention to
the fact. I was idiotic myself to think it would do any good.”

He turned back to Elihu and waved his empty glass without looking away to
his right, hoping that a passing waiter would take it in exchange for a full
one.

Norman shouldered his way through the people crowding close around Guinevere
and her intended victim. He heard suggestions: “Take it off and put it back
to front! Take off everything that’s newer than the century! Make it look a
bit older—like by tearing a few holes in it at the right places!”

“Just a second, Gwinnie,” he said boredly, triumphantly.

“What do you want to do, Norman—arbitrate?”

“As a matter of fact, yes. That looks like a year 2000 garment to me. How
about it, friend?”

“Why, it says right here on the label that it is, but—”

“Twentieth century, then.”

“What? Norman, you’re spouting dreck. Go away. Now I think what we ought to
do is—”

“The twenty-first century didn’t begin until a minute past midnight January
first 2001.”

Awkward pause. Someone: “Sheeting hole, I think he’s right.”

“Dreck. I recall distinctly on New Year’s 2000 we all—”

“And the commentators did say that wasn’t right, it comes back to me now.”

“The hole, let’s make him do it anyway.”

“No, got to fly by the course we set in the first place.”

Silence in the immediate vicinity.

“Gwinnie, I’m dreadfully afraid he’s right. He is, you know.”

Nods.

“Well, how funny! Lucky for him you came along, isn’t it, Norman? Never
mind, sparewheels, there’s bound to be someone else. Break it up and let it
fall free, hm?”

And, as she contrived to brush against Norman on her way to match orbits
with a circulating waiter: “Fix you later, you clever brown-nose!”

“You’re welcome to try, darling,” Norman said. “You’re welcome to try.”



SITUATION: suddenly and to Guinevere’s enormous chagrin, a real party flying
high and free in a genuine party-type orbit.



“Chad Mulligan? Never in a million lightyears!”

“I so testify.”

“Not the fat Afram?”

“No, the one with the beard.”

“The lean Afram?”

“Sheeting hole! No! The WASP talking to both of them.”

“Christ, everybody’s been saying he was dead!”



“Mel, I think some time later on we might break out a few caps of that stuff
I asked you to bring. There’s a too-clever bleeder here I’d like to fetch
down from orbit.”



“Hi, Don. Elihu, this is my roomie Donald Hogan—Chad Mulligan, Don.”

“Hi. Now, as I was saying, what McLuhan didn’t foresee although he came
sheeting close to it was—”

“I’m delighted to meet you, Mr. Masters, but this is about the last place
I’d have expected to run into you.”

“When Norman called on me the other night he mentioned this party and said I
should come if I wanted to see the kind of problems Aframs still have to
cope with in this country, so I thought it over and decided he was probably
right, I ought to.”

“You won’t get the full measure of Guinevere’s ingenuity just standing by
and watching, sir. You need to be someone like Norman, who’s about on her
own level, not someone with cachet like yours.”

“Why?”

“If you’d turned up wearing your ordinary street-clothes she’d only have
made you pay some kind of nominal forfeit—standing on your head for ten
seconds, or singing a song, or taking off your shoes. Something that
wouldn’t have interfered with your enjoyment of the rest of the party, I
mean.”

“That’s what one generally expects at a forfeits party, isn’t it?”

“There’s been a change since you went abroad, sir.” Why all this “sirring”?
Must be a subconscious response to the fact that as of this morning I’m
officially Lieutenant Hogan! “A few years ago that was true. Not any more.”

“I see. I think. Give me examples.”

“Oh … Well, I’ve seen her compel guests to daub themselves all over with
ketchup—and shave their heads bald—and crawl around the floor on hands and
knees for an hour, until she got tired of enforcing that—and, if you’ll
forgive me going into such details, to piss themselves. That comes later and
is used to get rid of people she doesn’t want to stay around when the orgy
starts.”

“That goes without saying, does it?”

“Oh yes.”

“Is that why people stand for such treatment?”

Chad Mulligan broke in; for the past few moments, unnoticed, he had
abandoned the conversation he was having with Norman and had been listening
to Donald and Elihu.”

“Sheeting hole, no! At least I’ll wager it’s not why Norman keeps coming,
unless you’ve got a well-concealed masochistic streak—hey, Norman?”

“Some people come out of masochism, definitely,” Norman shrugged. “They like
to be publicly humiliated. You can generally spot them; they’re blatantly
infringing whatever the rule of the evening is, but steering clear of
Guinevere’s direct attention until fairly late when they’ve drunk enough or
smoked or ingested whatever they need to give them sufficient offyourass for
the show-down. Then they go in for cringing and begging to be let off and
being jeered at for spoilsports—the whole shtick—and generally they come
while they’re getting the treatment. Which of course makes everything
free-falling for them and that’s why they accepted the invitation anyway.
Harmless, mostly.”

“I was asking about you, not them,” Chad said impatiently.

“Me? I keep coming here because—okay, I’ll open up wide. It’s a constant
challenge. She’s a mean bitch, but she’s never yet caved me in on one single
forfeit, and there have been times when there were thirty or forty of her
pet sparewheels yelling for me to pay one. That’s why I keep on accepting.
And frankly it seems to me like a damned stupid reason. This one is going to
be my last, and if you weren’t here, Chad, and if I hadn’t conned Elihu into
coming, I’d have left already.”

Donald looked at Chad Mulligan. He still only half-believed that this was
the genuine article, but the resemblance to the pictures on the jackets of
Mulligan’s books was unmistakable—the keen eyes peering out from under heavy
brows, the hair combed diagonally back, the neatly trimmed moustache and
beard setting off the cynical line of the mouth. There was a more dissipated
look to the face in reality than there had been in the publicity shots, but
maybe that was due to age rather than actual surrender.

He hoped so.



“Darling, you do the zock marvellously! You have the genuine free-fall
touch!”

“Why, Gwinnie, that’s sweet of you.”

“There’s just one trouble, darling. The zock is strictly a this-minute
dance, isn’t it?”

“Forfeit! Forfeit!”

“I’m afraid they’re right, darling, much as it pains me to insist. Don’t you
know any of the old dances? How about the shaitan? That goes to this kind of
rhythm, I think.”

“Of course it does, Gwinnie. I’m terribly sorry, I should have thought. You
want me to do the shaitan for my forfeit?”

“That’s right. But—somebody hand me that dish of honey from the table there?
Thank you, lover-girl. Hold this in between your elbows while you’re
demonstrating it.”

“But—Gwinnie! It’ll get all over everything!”

“That’s the idea, darling. Come on now, and make with the whole bit. I want
to see you touch the floor with the back of your head.”



“Well, yes, I am a bit out of sorts, I guess. You see, I’m taking this
metabolic-rebalancing course that the Orbital Clinic provides for people who
don’t respond to Triptine—you’ve heard about that? Uh-huh. And there’s one
drecky drawback, which is it makes you much more susceptible to colds, so
I’m full to here with counteragents and what with one thing and another my
hormones and enzymes are going over Niagara in a barrel. I say, is that
twentieth-century or nineteenth?”

“Of course, it’s public knowledge that if the Nark Force was given the funds
and support it needs to enforce the legislation it’s supposed to the
government would be out on its ear tomorrow. But the discontent needed for a
genuine revolution is being drained off into orbit somewhere and that suits
Washington fine.”

“So they got these two volunteers, you see, this codder and this shiggy who
didn’t give a pint of dreck about doing it in public, and they laid on this
exhibition of human reproductive processes for Shalmaneser.”

“No matter what they say I can’t tolerate adherents to a cult which doesn’t
respect the human rights of non-members. That’s bigotry irrespective of what
verbal haze you generate around it. And these Right Catholics with their
insistence on unrestricted breeding are trespassing on the human rights of
everyone else’s children. They sheeting well ought to be banned.”

“Right across the block from where my brother-in-law lives. And such a
mild-mannered old codder too, he said. Just picked up this butcher’s cleaver
and chopped the heads off the kids he was looking after, then went up on the
roof with this crate of empty bottles, and started hurling them down on the
people below. Killed one, blinded another, had to be fused by a police
copter. Could be anybody, you see—and without universal
personality-profiling how can one be sure who’s going to turn mucker?”

“Well, we’re pretty lucky, you see. We managed to get into a club—about
fifteen couples, all celebrated their twenty-first, very nice people—and
there’s a sitting rota so we get to look after the prodgies of members who
have clean genotypes. There are nearly a dozen altogether and one of the
shiggies is supposed to be preg with twins. Marvellous. We can reckon on
having prodgies around the place at least one night a week. It’s not like
having one’s own, but—well, there’s no help for it. We have schizophrenia on
both sides of the marriage and the risk is far too great.”

“Oh no. Philip is much too young to come along to a party like this. Time
enough later on to become sophisticated and cynical and debauched like us
oldsters, that’s what I keep telling him. Of course he doesn’t like it—goes
on all the time about what other parents allow their prodgies to do at his
age—but one doesn’t want to see the bloom of innocence rubbed off too soon,
does one? You’re only young once, after all.”

“Frank and Sheena? Oh, they went to Puerto Rico. Didn’t have any
choice—they’d sold the apt, bought the tickets, got jobs out there … But
they were furious! Said they were going to get out of the States altogether
as soon as possible so they could after all have their own prodgies. But
lord knows where they can go. Can’t see them roughing it in some benighted
backwater country for long, myself, and of course they’d never be allowed
back if they did start a family after being forbidden to do so here.”

“You heard what happened? Thought they were being clever. Found someone in
the Eugenics office who was open to—ah—persuasion and got themselves a
forged genalysis. Went to a private clinic, and the karyotype said they were
going to have a mongoloid idiot. Twenty-five thousand buckadingdongs it cost
them to get that gene certificate, and they had to have the kid aborted
after all!”

“We got ours through the Olive Almeiro Agency. Very big operation. Naturally
it can’t be passed off as our own—my wife is even fairer than I am and the
kid is dark, hair, skin, eyes, the whole shtick—but we could have waited
five, six years for a baby to match our own genotype and then not been able
to afford the cost.”

“So when these two had finished Shalmaneser said where’s the baby? And they
said oh, you have to wait nine months for that.”

“Look, I don’t mind panhandlers as such—in fact I think it’s a damned good
idea to license them because at least that gives you the option of choosing
whether you’re going to support a given individual case instead of simply
taxing you and passing the money on in welfare allotments to wastrels and
vagabonds. But the way the union has got whole districts of the city sewn up
now and insists on kickbacks and drives non-members out of the area—that’s
more than I can swallow!”

“Oh, are those the new Too Much joints? May I try one? I heard very good
things about the strain. Thanks. I hope Gwinnie doesn’t recognise them or
she’ll make us pay forfeit on them and I don’t like the look in her eye.
She’s building up to something really nasty, I suspect.”

“The draft got his balls. They’re cracking down very hard at the moment. Did
everything he could—turned up for the board with mother in tow, wearing one
of her dresses, orbiting like crazy, and they took him anyway. He’s in that
horrible army hospital St. Faith’s right this minute undergoing aversion
therapy for ambivalence and tripping both at once. It’s absolutely inhuman,
and of course if it works when he comes back he won’t want to know any of
his old friends, he’ll be one of their automatic push-button people, a good
solid respectable citizen. Doesn’t it make you want to weep?”

“One thing about this crazy party, I do depose—I never expected to see so
many shiggies at Guinevere’s place looking like shiggies instead of like
sterile-wrapped machines. Do you suppose she’s testing the temperature to
see if she should move the Beautiques over to the natural trend?”

“Happened all in a moment. One second, just a bunch of people walking down a
street, not going any place in particular, and the next, these brown-noses
clanging on big empty cans with sticks like drummers leading an army and all
sorts of dreck flying through the air and windows being smashed if they
weren’t out already and screaming and hysteria and the stink of panic. Did
you know you can actually smell terror when people start rioting?”

“Louisiana isn’t going to last much longer, you know. There’s a bill up for
next session in the state legislature which will ban child-bearing by anyone
who can’t prove three generations of residence. And what’s worse they’re
only offering five to two against it being passed. The governor has his two
prodgies now, you see.”

“I was in Detroit last week and that’s the most eerie place I ever did set
foot. Like a ghost town. All those abandoned factories for cars. And
crawling with squatters, of course. Matter of fact I went to a block party
in one of them. You should hear a zock group playing full blast under a
steel roof five hundred feet long! Didn’t need lifting—just stand and let
the noise wipe you out.”

“It’s more than a hobby, it’s a basic necessity for modern man. It fulfils a
fundamental psychological urge. Unless you know that if you have to you can
kill someone who gets in your way, preferably with your bare hands, the
pressure from all these people is going to cave you in.”

“I graduated with a master’s rating on throwing knives and a grade one
rating on hand-to-hand. I already have a marksman certificate on bolt-guns,
and next I’m intending to collect one for projectile weapons—rifles, pistols
and crossbows.”

“Sure you can come around, but don’t hope for too much. I’m living in a
group, you see, and there are eight of us, so I don’t feel much need for
variety. Also we have two kids and our shrinker says they have positively
Polynesian emotional stability so the last thing I want is to interfere with
a setup that’s paying such fine dividends. It’s the extended family bit, of
course.”

“Nevada’s mavericking again, did you hear? There’s a bill up for next
session to recognise polygamy and institute proper marriage and divorce laws
to cover it. Up to groups of ten, I think it says in the draft.”

“Don’t lie to me, darling. I saw that codder’s blip go up on your screens
the moment he asked you to dance. I’ve told you before and I’m telling you
again, I don’t mind you bivving it privately but I won’t stand for it in
public. So I’m an old-fashioned block, so I’m still your wife and if you
want me to stay that way you behave when you’re in company—catch me?”

“So Shalmaneser said well, if it takes nine months, why were you in such a
sheeting hurry at the end? Haw-haw-haw!”

“I’ve been hoping to have a word with Chad Mulligan, but I can’t pry him
away from those Aframs he’s talking to. I want to ask him whyinole when all
our dreams are about wide-open spaces and room to move and breathe we like
to cram ourselves together at parties till we can’t hardly cross the floor
of a room without shoving aside twenty other people.”

“Look, lover, you carry it off very well but I fly a perfectly straight
orbit and what’s more I’m married so why don’t you find someone who likes to
biv and stop harassing me?”

“I got one of these super disposalls, too, because the garbage clearance
down our block is five weeks—catch me, five!—overdue. And the first day I
try to use it comes in this sheeting little pest and says I’m violating the
clean-air laws. Great balls of dreck, clean air! There hasn’t been any clean
air in our neighbourhood for sheeting weeks because of rotting dreck all
over the streets and now it’s beginning to block the passages!”

“Yes, but what’s the use of arguing about politics these days? Isn’t such a
thing as politics. There’s just a choice between the ways you’re going to
cave in through force of circumstances. Look at Common Europe, look at
Russia, look at China, look at Africa. The sheeting pattern’s the same
except in some places it’s gone further than others.”

“Look, Schritt—all right! Look, Helmut! If you don’t get off my orbit and
let me fall free for a bit I’m going to stand right up where everyone can
hear me and pull rank, do you hear me? I don’t give a pint of whaledreck if
Chad Mulligan does sound subversive to you—he happens to be talking to our
ambassador to Beninia and I’m interested in what they’re saying. I was told
to carry on with my ordinary activities and if you’ve read my original brief
you sheeting well ought to know that it includes being interested in
everything relevant or not relevant to my assignment. Now go dig a hole and
lie down in it!”

“Things are getting tough again in India, apparently. It’s the protein that
was lost when the slit-eyes poisoned the Indian Ocean. And by the way, I
hear the containment programme is running behind—a current spilled over past
one of the barrages and they’ve been hauling out contaminated fish as far
north as Angola.”

“I have this new autoshout of GT’s that programmes itself on a signal from
the satellite. Haven’t missed a show in three weeks through rescheduling.
Should get one.”

“I use nothing but Kodak Wholopan R myself. The rating is 2400, to start
with, which means there’s practically nothing you can’t catch, and there’s
ninety-five per cent recovery on a division factor of twenty, which means
you never need more than one print and a pair of scissors.”

“No, that’s what’s so extraordinary. Freefly-suiting is terrific exercise, a
sort of dynamic tension method because all your muscles are working against
each other. Of course, you have to watch your calcium balance like a spy,
but there are treatments which actually improve it over normal Earthside
levels now.”

“The acceleratube makes commuting perfectly possible. I can get to work
quicker from Buffalo than I used to when I lived in Elizabeth.”

“I think I’ll have to take copter lessons.”

“You know that magnificent new block in Delaware that we spotted from the
plane as we were coming in and thought what a great place it could be to
live? Well, I just met someone who told me what it’s meant for, and unless
you feel like going out and shooting a fuzzy-wuzzy we can kiss the dream
goodbye. It’s a sheeting jail, that’s what it is—a new maxecurity jail!”

“We’re going to have to do as they’ve done in London and Frankfurt. We’re
going to have to make better use of the space already enclosed by the cities
we have. In London they’ve more or less given up the idea of streets except
for arterial throughways. They’re building over them and leaving nothing but
tubeways for passenger transit.”

“It just sort of folded like a leaky accordion, all thirty storeys of it.
Girders bulged outwards, floors lay down on top of each other, and squelch,
all the people who were living in it—I think they said nine hundred—were
flattened out like sardines in a sandwich. Apparently when they programmed
the computer which designed it they forgot to instruct it to allow for the
weight of the occupants.”

“Exceptionally good freevent the other night. It was literally indescribable
because it was so abstract. I still haven’t got over it.”

“What it does is sort of invert the responses—for example I never found
anything in my life quite so funny as the B Minor Mass. And let’s face it,
you know, in the ultimate analysis that’s a proper response in contemporary
terms.”

“Yes, I knew somebody who applied to them. Wanted to go out being gored by a
bull in front of a big cheering audience, believe it or not. So they fixed
it, got the setup from Mexico, wrung the buckadingdongs out of him and the
cost ran to plenty, of course, and he had a heart attack from overexcitement
before they turned the bull loose, so back he went to hospital to be revived
and he ran out of funds while he was getting better and in the end he just
signed an ordinary release and they withdrew his prosthetics. A débâcle on a
grand scale, but still a débâcle!”

“He and his sister joined the Mrs. Grundy Memorial Foundation and some
sheeting little prig turned up some forgotten ordinance and the case comes

“Skiing in Patagonia, I think. We were going to spend it under the
Caribbean, but Mr. and Mrs. Everywhere go there such a lot we’re afraid

“She’s quite marvellous. All I did was give her that lock of my mother’s

and I will take her out there ourselves.”

“Makes you wonder how our ancestors ever managed to breed such a sheeting
horde of human beings when every time you felt like it you had to take off
all these layers and layers of cloth.”

“I think I’m going to sue them even though they didn’t give me a guarantee.
I mean, eight thousand isn’t to be dropped like an empty pack of reefers, is
it? And all the pup did when we got it home was sit around snivelling and
pee on the floor every half-hour. The prodgies were heart-broken, of course,
because they did so much want a green dog and they just wept and wept so I’m
sure it was traumatic for them. Edna says I should have gone to some other
company who’ve cut down the side-effects, but believe me I’m not going to
risk another gene-moulded pet. They can make do with a regular cat next
time.”

“I never took to polyforming. Rather stay with my old hobby of vicarious

“Thinking of cutting out to join one of these communities in Arizona.”

“Dead set on going into the space service but I guess he’ll grow out of it

“Sold my shares in Hitrip like a sheeting idiot and then two months later
they announced the Too Much strain and I guess I lost fifty thousand

“So they programmed Shalmaneser with the formula for Triptine, you see, and
then these jokers fed in the question How Hi is a Chinaman.”

“I think instead of increasing it to four months’ vacation they should
operate two shifts on monthly rotation. Of course it would cost but the
degree to which it would increase the self-respect of the employees would
more than make up for it.”

“Most of them seem to be at it in the roof-garden. Want to go and watch, get
some pressure up for later?”

“I think these cigarettes are horrible. Made my throat so sore. And my guts
are all sour and nasty. Did people really use twenty in a day?”

“They call it streamlining, of course, but what it comes down to is they’re
undermining my responsibility in the firm and I’m going to fight tooth and
claw to hang on to what I’ve got. If I have to play it dirty that’ll be
their fault, not mine.”

“Of course I don’t love Henry the way I love you but the shrinker did tell
me I ought to occasionally.”

“I’m just cutting jets for a prayer or two but I’ll be back—don’t get
involved with anyone else.”

“That makes seventeen different mixtures I’ve tried, and I’d better have
some antalc, right away.”

“I think it was bitchy not to tell Miriam it was pig-meat.”

“They’re trying to ranch the orange ones in Kenya but apparently so far only
the pale-blue ones will breed true in the wild state.”

“I think I’m going to shake off my holding in MAMP. It’s been years after
all and by this time I’m wondering if the rumours about the big strike were
just propaganda.”

“Had a chance to talk to Chad Mulligan? Nor have I. I was wondering whether
to be really twentieth-century and go ask for his autograph.”

“Campaign to get whales back by breeding up from smaller aquatic mammals but
the cost is astronomical!”

“Blew up three bridges before the fuzzy-wuzzies fused them and one of them
turned out to be in the same class as my son Hugh.”

“I’m sorry to snivel like this but it’s damned unfair having him killed in a
stupid sheeting accident like that and now being married to someone who’s
not allowed to father prodgies. And he was only six, he couldn’t even read
yet!”

“Watch out for Guinevere—I think she’s building up to the big staged ones.
I’m going up to the other floor for a bit. Some of the things she does when
she’s in that mood don’t strike me as funny.”

“I got on fine with Don and to be quite honest I half-hoped he’d ask me to
make it permanent. But I couldn’t stand his roomie.”

“Of course it can’t be the Chinese who supply them with sabotage equipment.
Explosives and thermite maybe, but not the tailored bacteria they used to
bring down that apartment building in Santa Monica.”

“So Shalmaneser said how high is a Chinaman? I don’t know, but if he’s any
higher than I am we might as well quit because they have us beat.”

“Accused of reviving thuggee—you know, Kali-worship?—and the crowd stormed
the court and set them free.”

“Wanted to be burned alive in protest against the draft but the directors of

Going to jail for ten years, I gather. Evasion.”

“A totally corrupt police-force is the next best to a perfectly honest one.
Ours is quite livable with. Mark you, it takes a bit of time occasionally
finding out who’s bidding against you, but there are only a few
possibilities in a small community like ours.”

“So when he said he had a clean genotype but he was going to be sterilised
anyway I lost my temper—can you blame me?”

“It’s twentieth-century for me to be jealous, isn’t it? You keep away from
my wife or I’ll get Gwinnie to make you pay forfeit for behaving in a
twenty-first century manner!”

“I’m going to have to find out more about Beninia, Elihu. I can’t really
believe what you say is true.”

“I got two glasses of the ’98 Château Lafite before it ran out and believe
me it was quite an experience.”

“Have you tried it intravenously? You can get diadermic guns for about forty
or fifty bucks, and it makes a galaxy of difference to the lift.”

“Talking about clearing the old Renault factory but it’ll be like civil
war—there are sixty thousand squatters on the ground and apparently some of
them have bolt-guns and the place is crawling with old projectile weapons of
course because they went over to sporting guns when they closed.”

“Told me about this public execution he went to in Algeria and it got me so
excited I just couldn’t help myself. Why don’t you ask him about it? He did
say he bivs occasionally.”

“So she told her to smear her belly with apple-butter and let the sparewheel
lick it off. She’s getting nasty, darling. Next time it won’t be licking,
it’ll be biting. Want to blast off for home?”

“Look out, he’s got a knife!”

GRAPH GUINEVERE: an early peak followed by a flat low line marked at its
inception by Norman’s correction of her judgment regarding the man in the
year 2000 suit. Since then, a state of suppressed anger, punctuated by only
enough minor forfeits to keep that hard core of her sparewheels contented.
Saving up the remainder—all noted with sharp eyes and double-checked
mentally to avoid a second similar gaffe—for an unusually extensive series
of set-piece forfeits at the end of the evening. Included with
question-marks, people like the ambassador who has completely wasted his
cachet and Chad Mulligan’s into the bargain by talking together non-stop
throughout the evening despite several attempts to make them circulate.
Trust a brown-nose to foul things up, ambassador or no.

GRAPH DONALD HOGAN: a jagged line varying between sick dismay masked with
polite and occasionally quite interesting chat to Elihu, Chad, Gennice and
other acquaintances, and raw fury at being dogged by Sergeant Schritt. Four
separate attempts to corner the man from Bellevue privately and perform that
quasi-suicidal act of obtaining from him some sort of lifter or whatever
that would enable him to break his cover under the pretence of being slipped
a cap by someone unknown. Shortly, the line due to snap up into the
unknowable hyperbolic future course of the activated spy.

GRAPH GENNICE: a high-level curve with a lot of peaks of amusement and
enjoyment because she’s very fond of her new man, but with occasional
wistful dips caused by wondering whether it’s her departure that made that
nice Don Hogan feel so low tonight.

GRAPH CHAD AND ELIHU: an early plateau low on the scale, then a simultaneous
rise and a long, long parallel run not across the regular chart of the party
but away from it at an angle of their own, pacing each other and still
rising.

GRAPH NORMAN: an early peak caused by so successfully scoring off Guinevere,
followed by a slow decline with occasional bumps tending towards
determination to see her look equally foolish if she tries to involve him in
a set-piece forfeit or towards self-disgust because he prizes such a petty
achievement.

GRAPH THE PARTY: a planar representation hillocking over the roof-garden
where those interested mostly in sex congregated early and heavily indented
in the vicinity of Donald, Norman, Guinevere herself and one or two more,
otherwise generally on an acceptably high level although a good many people
have had the edge taken off their enjoyment by the aura radiating from
Guinevere by now consulting in whispers with certain chosen sparewheels and
who can be sure what infelicity, what incongruity, as minor as having
referred to a post-turn-of-century artwork has given her the opening for
another arrowed forfeit?



“If Gwinnie picks on me I’m going to give her a present. From this firm that
sends people around to invade your apt and wreck the furniture!”

Now I can get the two shiggies, the fat and the thin ones, to change
clothes, which ought to be good for five minutes and a few giggles, and
during that time slip Norman a cap of …



“What was that?”

“That girl with the hideous caped outfit, I think—I saw Gwinnie consulting a
history of costume in the other room just now.”

“Excuse me, do you mind saying that again?”



Like a cool breeze soughing through the room: a wave of interest and
curiosity.



“No, that weird codder Lazarus hasn’t been through the mill yet and I never
knew him to miss. He loves being humiliated, gives him the strangest kind of
lift, apparently.”

“Are you sure? Who told you?”

“I made a wager with myself that she’d pick on Renée—you know, the fat
shiggy with the glandular thing they can’t cure, like a big sagging jelly?
She always gets hit hard.”

And what I’m going to do to Norman will make history. Not this time the
cunning brown-nose doesn’t get off lightly! That codder with the Black Belt
in case he tries to duck out, to be safe. Where is he? Not involved with
another shiggy!

“But it must be pure propaganda! I mean, so far not even the dogs and cats
and bushbabies they’ve made over for pets are…”

“Is something going on over there?”

“Let’s find out, shall we?”

“Darlings, how convenient for me to have caught you talking to each other!
You see, I’m terribly afraid that—”

“If SCANALYZER carried it the news must have been processed by Shalmaneser
so it’s at least possible. Unless they carried it in the rumour slot, was
that it?”



It began to dawn on Guinevere by slow degrees that for the first time ever
since she took to throwing forfeits parties the arrival of her well-briefed
gang of sparewheels in the neighbourhood of the victims chosen for the first
of the grand forfeits, the set-pieces that would include dialogue and climax
in acts of maximum humiliation to get rid of people she was tired of
knowing, had not signalled silence and giggling and craning of necks and
climbing on furniture for a better view. Instead, on the far side of the
room, a large number of the guests were talking to each other with serious
faces, apparently sceptical but not scoffing. She waited a moment. A few
people drifted away from the unidentified focus of attention and others
joined; somebody hurried out of the room and came back with half a dozen
friends also to be told—whatever the news might be.

“Hullo!” Norman said softly. “What’s going on? Guinevere isn’t getting the
rapt audience she counts on.”

“Think war’s broken out?” Chad muttered and grabbed a fresh drink from a
passing tray.

Alarm transfixed Donald like a lightning strike. The randomness of his
activating this morning, unaccountable in terms of what the news channels
were carrying, made him think for a moment that it could all too easily be
war.

“Chad, what did you say about crying wolf in The Hipcrime Vocab?”

“Howinole do you expect me to remember? I’m drunk!”

“Wasn’t it something about—?”

“Ah, sheeting hole! I said it was an ad-hoc form of Pavlovian conditioning
adopted by those with a lust for power to prevent the people due to be
slaughtered in the next war from taking them out and humanely drowning them.
Okay?”

“Why do you hate Miss Steel so much?” Elihu asked Norman under his breath.

“I don’t hate her personally, though if she were enough of a person to be
worth such a strong emotion I think I easily could. What I hate is what she
represents: the willingness of human beings to be reduced to a slick visual
package, like a new television set—up-to-the-minute casing, same old works.”

“I hope I can believe that,” Elihu said unhappily.

“Why?”

“People who hate in concrete terms are dangerous. People who manage to hate
only in abstracts are the only ones worth having for your friends.”

“Plagiarist!” Chad threw at him.

“Did you say that?”

“Christ yes. Put it in a book.”

“Someone quoted it to me once.” A look of wonder crossed Elihu’s face. “As a
matter of fact it was Zad Obomi.”

“Profit but no honour in my own country,” Chad grunted.

“What’s she going to do now?” Norman said, watching Guinevere intently. They
all turned to look; they were in a good spot from which to see what
happened, able to view it along a sort of alley between the clump of people
who had congregated to witness the humiliation of the fat girl and the thin
one, and the other group worriedly muttering to each other about the as yet
mysterious news.

“Shelley-lover,” Guinevere said to the man at the centre of the latter
assembly, “if the news you’re spreading is so millennially important don’t
you think you should share it with everybody rather than letting it wander
around on its own, suffering the folk-process? What is it—have the Chinese
towed California out to sea, possibly, or has the Second Coming been
announced?”

“Second!” someone unidentifiable said within earshot of Don. “Prophet’s
beard, you should try that new stiffener Ralph’s been feeding me!”

Guinevere looked for him with a glare of murderous ferocity and failed to
locate him.

“Well, it’s something that was on SCANALYZER earlier this evening, Gwinnie,”
the man she had addressed as Shelley explained in an apologetic manner.
“Apparently the government of Yatakang has announced a two-generation
programme based on a new breakthrough in tectogenetics. First off they’re
going to optimise their population by making sure that only children of
first-class heredity get born, and later, when they’ve done that, they’re
going to start improving the genalysis and—well, I guess the only way you
can put it is to say they propose to breed supermen.”

    What is the most important network security spend: Sensor
    appliances? SIEM? Threat intelligence feeds? It's your analyst
    team.

    Defenders, you're not stopping attacks. You're increasing attacker
    requirements. 'Stopping' breeds a mindset ignorant of
    countermoves.

    Your network is a directed graph of credentials. Hacking is graph
    traversal. See the graph or all you'll see is exfil.

    Things go wrong right here. Admins focus on control to possess
    secrets. Hackers focus on secrets to possess control. Hackers are
    right.

    On vulns: You can argue over exposure, difficulty, and
    likelihood. Security researchers write exploits because they like
    the truth.

    Pentest is the most misused security practice. Pentest is
    diagnostic. Go from treating the bugs as output, to treating them
    as input.

    Software engrs hide reality by using architecture over
    implementation. Hackers reveal reality by using implementation
    against architecture

    Do security jobs need a degree? Remember self-taught hackers made
    most of our progress. When academia sits out, autodidacts show the
    way.

    If you shame attack research, you misjudge its
    contribution. Offense and defense aren't peers. Defense is
    offense's child.

    Biggest problem with network defense is that defenders think in

You introduced intersectionality more than 30 years ago. How do you explain what it means today?

These days, I start with what it’s not, because there has been distortion. It’s not identity politics on steroids. It is not a mechanism to turn white men into the new pariahs. It’s basically a lens, a prism, for seeing the way in which various forms of inequality often operate together and exacerbate each other. We tend to talk about race inequality as separate from inequality based on gender, class, sexuality or immigrant status. What’s often missing is how some people are subject to all of these, and the experience is not just the sum of its parts.

Atwater: Y'all don't quote me on this. You start out in 1954 by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger". So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the back-burner.

"My decision to leave Spitzer after less than a year is fairly straightforward: I was not able to build enough support to be able to deliver on either my promise of change, or my vision of it. The reasons why are more complex. Part of it has to do with COVID-19 and the rapid lockdown, which occurred after only three months in post. It's hard enough to build social capital in a new place without having to do it over Zoom. Part of it too has to do with the wider inflexibility of U.S. academic structures. In an incredibly bureaucratic and highly-regulated context, change is as much administrative as it is conceptual. The lack of meaningful support—not lip service, of which there's always a surfeit—meant my workload was absolutely crippling. No job is worth one's life and at times I genuinely feared for my own. Race is never far from the surface of any situation in the U.S. Having come directly from South Africa, I wasn't prepared for the way it manifests in the U.S. and quite simply, I lacked the tools to both process and deflect it. The lack of respect and empathy for Black people, especially Black women, caught me off guard, although it's by no means unique to Spitzer. I suppose I'd say in the end that my resignation was a profound act of self-preservation."

Q: Hate the house rules: What are your thoughts on people who have “house rules” for commonly played board or card games? My in-laws have some for Gin Rummy that are terribly irritating, and people all seem to have their own rules for Monopoly. Am I allowed to insist on the real rules being played at my own house? I hate to be a stickler, but who just makes up rules for board games?

A: All rules for board games are made up. All games were, at some point, made up; there is no natural, immutable way to play Gin Rummy. The original rules of Monopoly only exist because someone in the early 1900s wanted to explain the tax theories of Henry George via a board game; there is no objective version of Monopoly. Moreover, the worst sort of argument one can have with relatives is one where the stakes are low but the sense of grievance is high. You will likely never convince your in-laws that their game rules are irritating, no matter how passionately you argue your case. Cheerfully embrace your in-laws’ ridiculous house rules (or politely decline to play and read a book instead), and feel free to make up your own rules at home, although if you find yourself at a point where every time you play a game you have to insist that everyone else follow “the real rules,” you might want to do something besides play board games with your guests. (There are no real rules. There are no real games, only endless variations on an arbitrary theme. Embrace chaos.)

Live a good life.
If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been,
but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.
If there are gods, but unjust, then tyou should not want to worship them.
If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

*** Sim city essay
Cities are not people. But, like people, cities have their own personalities: in some cases one city has many different personalities -- there are a dozen Londons, a crowd of different New Yorks.

A city is a collection of lives and buildings, and it has identity and personality. Cities exist in location, and in time.

There are good cities -- the ones that welcome you, that seem to care about you, that seem pleased you're in them. There are indifferent cities -- the ones that honestly don't care if you're there or not; cities with their own agendas, the ones that ignore people. There are cities gone bad, and there are places in otherwise healthy cities as rotten and maggoty as windfall apples. There are even cities that seem lost -- some, lacking a centre, feel like they would be happier being elsewhere, somewhere smaller, somewhere easier to understand.

Some cities spread, like cancers or B-movie slime monsters, devouring all in their way, absorbing towns and villages, swallowing boroughs and hamlets, transmuting into boundless conurbations. Other cities shrink -- once prosperous areas empty and fail: buildings empty, windows are boarded up, people leave, and sometimes they cannot even tell you why.

Occasionally I idle time away by wondering what cities would be like, were they people. Manhattan is, in my head, fast-talking, untrusting, well-dressed but unshaven. London is huge and confused. Paris is elegant and attractive, older than she looks. San Francisco is crazy, but harmless, and very friendly.

It's a foolish game: cities aren't people.

Cities exist in location, and they exist in time. Cities accumulate their personalities as time goes by. Manhattan remembers when it was unfashionable farmland. Athens remembers the days when there were those who considered themselves Athenians. There are cities that remember being villages. Other cities -- currently bland, devoid of personality -- are prepared to wait until they have history. Few cities are proud: they know that it's all too often a happy accident, a mere geographical fluke that they exist at all -- a wide harbour, a mountain pass, the confluence of two rivers.

At present, cities stay where they are.

For now cities sleep.

But there are rumblings. Things change. And what if, tomorrow, cities woke, and went walking? If Tokyo engulfed your town? If Vienna came striding over the hill toward you? If the city you inhabit today just upped and left, and you woke tomorrow wrapped in a thin blanket on an empty plain, where Detroit once stood, or Sydney, or Moscow?

Don't ever take a city for granted.

After all, it is bigger than you are; it is older; and it has learned how to wait...

Man, like the universe, is a machine.
Nothing enters our minds or determines our actions which is not
directly or indirectly a response to stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without.
** Noam Chomsky
In my own professional work I have touched on a variety of different fields. I've done my work in mathematical linguistics, for example, without any professional credentials in mathematics; in this subject I am completely self-taught, and not very well taught. But I've often been invited by universities to speak on mathematical linguistics at mathematics seminars and colloquia. No one has ever asked me whether I have the appropriate credentials to speak on these subjects; the mathematicians couldn't care less. What they want to know is what I have to say. No one has ever objected to my right to speak, asking whether I have a doctor's degree in mathematics, or whether I have taken advanced courses in the subject. That would never have entered their minds. They want to know whether I am right or wrong, whether the subject is interesting or not, whether better approaches are possible - the discussion dealt with the subject, not with my right to discuss it.

But on the other hand, in discussion or debate concerning social issues or American foreign policy, Vietnam or the Middle East, for example, the issue is constantly raised, often with considerable venom. I've repeatedly been challenged on the grounds of credentials, or asked, what special training do you have that entitles you to speak of these matters. The assumption is that people like me, who are outsiders from a professional standpoint, are not entitled to speak on such things.

Compare mathematics and the political sciences -- it's quite striking. In mathematics, in physics, people are concerned with what you say, not with your certification. But in order to speak about social reality, you must have the proper credentials, particularly if you depart from the accepted framework of thinking. Generally speaking, it seems fair to say that the richer the intellectual substance of a field, the less there is a concern for credentials, and the greater is concern for content.

** Norbert Wiener
If man were to adopt this community as a pattern, he would live in a fascist
state, in which ideally each individual is conditioned from birth for his proper
occupation: in which rulers are perpetually rulers, soldiers perpectually soldiers,
the peasant is never more than a peasant, and the worker is doomed to be a
worker.

It is a thesis of this chapter that this aspiration for a human state based on the model of the ant results from a profound misapprehension both of the nature
of the ant and the nature of man.

Clearly, these new jobs would not replace the old ones, and nor should they.
Get rid of all the cleaners, rubbish collectors, bus drivers, supermarket
checkout staff and secretaries, for example, and society will very quickly grind
to a halt.
On the other hand, if we woke up one morning to find that all the highly paid
advertising executives, management consultants, and private equity directors had
disappeared, society would go on much as it did before: in a lot of cases,
probably quite a bit better.  So, to begin with, workers need to reclaim a sense
of pride and social worth.
Doing so would be a big step forward in making the case that the wages and
conditions of low-paid jobs must be improved in order to reflect the importance
they have in all of our lives.

Charm and charisma in fact designate the power, which certain people
have, to impose their own self-image as the objective and collective image of

object, who thereby becomes an absolute subject, without an exterior (being his
own Other), fully justified in existing, legitimated.

The union is an expression of the prophetic profile of society. The union is born and reborn every time that, like the biblical prophets, it gives a voice to those who have none, denounces those who would “sell the needy for a pair of sandals” (cf. Amos 2: 6), unmasks the powerful who trample the rights of the most vulnerable workers, defends the cause of the foreigner, the least, the discarded.

The capitalism of our time does not understand the value of the trade union, because it has forgotten the social nature of the economy, of the business. This is one of the greatest sins. Market economy: no. Let us say, social market economy, as St. John Paul II taught: social market economy. The economy has forgotten the social nature that it has as a vocation, the social nature of business, of life, of bonds and pacts. But perhaps our society does not understand the union also because it does not fight enough in terms of the “not yet rights”: of the existential peripheries, among those rejected from work.

“We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.”

It is now highly feasible to take care of everybody on Earth at a ‘higher standard of living than any have ever known.’ It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary and henceforth unrationalizable as mandated by survival. Most importantly we have learned that from here on it is success for all or none, for it is experimentally proven by physics that “unity is plural and at minimum two” – the complementary but not mirror-imaged proton and neutron. You and I are inherently different and complimentary. Together we average as zero – that is, as eternity.

"We can now take care of everybody at a higher standard of living than anybody has ever known. It does not have to be “you or me,” so selfishness is unnecessary and war is obsolete. This has never been done before.“

You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that
makes the existing model obsolete.

*** Law 1: Never Outshine the Master

   Always make those above you feel comfortably
   superior.  In your desire to please or impress
   them, do not go too far in displaying your talents
   or you might accomplish the opposite – inspire
   fear and insecurity.  Make your masters appear
   more brilliant than they are and you will attain
   the heights of power.

*** Law 2: Never put too Much Trust in Friends, Learn how to
   use Enemies

   Be wary of friends-they will betray you more
   quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy.
   They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire
   a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a
   friend, because he has more to prove.  In fact,
   you have more to fear from friends than from
   enemies.  If you have no enemies, find a way to
   make them.

*** Law 3: Conceal your Intentions

   Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never
   revealing the purpose behind your actions.  If
   they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot
   prepare a defense.  Guide them far enough down the
   wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by
   the time they realize your intentions, it will be
   too late.

*** Law 4: Always Say Less than Necessary

   When you are trying to impress people with words,
   the more you say, the more common you appear, and
   the less in control.  Even if you are saying
   something banal, it will seem original if you make
   it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.  Powerful
   people impress and intimidate by saying less.  The
   more you say, the more likely you are to say
   something foolish.

*** Law 5: So Much Depends on Reputation – Guard it with your Life

   Reputation is the cornerstone of power.  Through
   reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once
   you slip, however, you are vulnerable, and will be
   attacked on all sides.  Make your reputation
   unassailable.  Always be alert to potential
   attacks and thwart them before they happen.
   Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by
   opening holes in their own reputations.  Then
   stand aside and let public opinion hang them.

*** Law 6: Court Attention at all Cost

   Everything is judged by its appearance; what is
   unseen counts for nothing.  Never let yourself get
   lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion.
   Stand out.  Be conspicuous, at all cost.  Make
   yourself a magnet of attention by appearing
   larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the
   bland and timid masses.

*** Law 7: Get others to do the Work for you, but Always Take the Credit

   Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other
   people to further your own cause.  Not only will
   such assistance save you valuable time and energy,
   it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and
   speed.  In the end your helpers will be forgotten
   and you will be remembered.  Never do yourself
   what others can do for you.

*** Law 8: Make other People come to you – use Bait if Necessary

   When you force the other person to act, you are
   the one in control.  It is always better to make
   your opponent come to you, abandoning his own
   plans in the process.  Lure him with fabulous
   gains – then attack.  You hold the cards.

*** Law 9: Win through your Actions, Never through Argument

   Any momentary triumph you think gained through
   argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The
   resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger
   and lasts longer than any momentary change of
   opinion.  It is much more powerful to get others
   to agree with you through your actions, without
   saying a word.  Demonstrate, do not explicate.

*** Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky

   You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional
   states are as infectious as disease.  You may feel
   you are helping the drowning man but you are only
   precipitating your own disaster.  The unfortunate
   sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will
   also draw it on you.  Associate with the happy and
   fortunate instead.

*** Law 11: Learn to Keep People Dependent on You

   To maintain your independence you must always be
   needed and wanted.  The more you are relied on,
   the more freedom you have.  Make people depend on
   you for their happiness and prosperity and you
   have nothing to fear.  Never teach them enough so
   that they can do without you.

*** Law 12: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim

   One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens
   of dishonest ones.  Open-hearted gestures of
   honesty and generosity bring down the guard of
   even the most suspicious people.  Once your
   selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you
   can deceive and manipulate them at will.  A timely
   gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same
   purpose.

*** Law 13: When Asking for Help, Appeal to People’s Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy or Gratitude

   If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not
   bother to remind him of your past assistance and
   good deeds.  He will find a way to ignore you.
   Instead, uncover something in your request, or in
   your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and
   emphasize it out of all proportion.  He will
   respond enthusiastically when he sees something to
   be gained for himself.

*** Law 14: Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy

   Knowing about your rival is critical.  Use spies
   to gather valuable information that will keep you
   a step ahead.  Better still: Play the spy
   yourself.  In polite social encounters, learn to
   probe.  Ask indirect questions to get people to
   reveal their weaknesses and intentions.  There is
   no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful
   spying.

*** Law 15: Crush your Enemy Totally

   All great leaders since Moses have known that a
   feared enemy must be crushed completely.
   (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.)
   If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly
   it smolders, a fire will eventually break out.
   More is lost through stopping halfway than through
   total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and
   will seek revenge.  Crush him, not only in body
   but in spirit.

*** Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor

   Too much circulation makes the price go down: The
   more you are seen and heard from, the more common
   you appear.  If you are already established in a
   group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you
   more talked about, even more admired.  You must
   learn when to leave.  Create value through
   scarcity.

*** Law 17: Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability

   Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable
   need to see familiarity in other people’s actions.
   Your predictability gives them a sense of control.
   Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable.
   Behavior that seems to have no consistency or
   purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will
   wear themselves out trying to explain your moves.
   Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate
   and terrorize.

*** Law 18: Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself – Isolation is Dangerous

   The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere
   – everyone has to protect themselves.  A fortress
   seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to
   more dangers than it protects you from – it cuts
   you off from valuable information, it makes you
   conspicuous and an easy target.  Better to
   circulate among people find allies, mingle.  You
   are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.

*** Law 19: Know Who You’re Dealing with – Do Not Offend the Wrong Person

   There are many different kinds of people in the
   world, and you can never assume that everyone will
   react to your strategies in the same way.  Deceive
   or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the
   rest of their lives seeking revenge.  They are
   wolves in lambs’ clothing.  Choose your victims
   and opponents carefully, then – never offend or
   deceive the wrong person.

*** Law 20: Do Not Commit to Anyone

   It is the fool who always rushes to take sides.
   Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself.
   By maintaining your independence, you become the
   master of others – playing people against one
   another, making them pursue you.

*** Law 21: Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker – Seem Dumber than your Mark

   No one likes feeling stupider than the next
   persons.  The trick, is to make your victims feel
   smart – and not just smart, but smarter than you
   are.  Once convinced of this, they will never
   suspect that you may have ulterior motives.

*** Law 22: Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power

   When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake;
   choose surrender instead.  Surrender gives you
   time to recover, time to torment and irritate your
   conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane.  Do
   not give him the satisfaction of fighting and
   defeating you – surrender first.  By turning the
   other check you infuriate and unsettle him.  Make
   surrender a tool of power.

*** Law 23: Concentrate Your Forces

   Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them
   concentrated at their strongest point.  You gain
   more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper,
   than by flitting from one shallow mine to another
   – intensity defeats extensity every time.  When
   looking for sources of power to elevate you, find
   the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you
   milk for a long time to come.

*** Law 24: Play the Perfect Courtier

   The perfect courtier thrives in a world where
   everything revolves around power and political
   dexterity.  He has mastered the art of
   indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and
   asserts power over others in the mot oblique and
   graceful manner.  Learn and apply the laws of
   courtiership and there will be no limit to how far
   you can rise in the court.

*** Law 25: Re-Create Yourself

   Do not accept the roles that society foists on
   you.  Re-create yourself by forging a new
   identity, one that commands attention and never
   bores the audience.  Be the master of your own
   image rather than letting others define if for
   you.  Incorporate dramatic devices into your
   public gestures and actions – your power will be
   enhanced and your character will seem larger than
   life.

*** Law 26: Keep Your Hands Clean

   You must seem a paragon of civility and
   efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by
   mistakes and nasty deeds.  Maintain such a
   spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats
   and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement.

*** Law 27: Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cultlike Following

   People have an overwhelming desire to believe in
   something.  Become the focal point of such desire
   by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow.
   Keep your words vague but full of promise;
   emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear
   thinking.  Give your new disciples rituals to
   perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your
   behalf.  In the absence of organized religion and
   grand causes, your new belief system will bring
   you untold power.

*** Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness

   If you are unsure of a course of action, do not
   attempt it.  Your doubts and hesitations will
   infect your execution.  Timidity is dangerous:
   Better to enter with boldness.  Any mistakes you
   commit through audacity are easily corrected with
   more audacity.  Everyone admires the bold; no one
   honors the timid.

*** Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End

   The ending is everything.  Plan all the way to it,
   taking into account all the possible consequences,
   obstacles, and twists of fortune that might
   reverse your hard work and give the glory to
   others.  By planning to the end you will not be
   overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know
   when to stop.  Gently guide fortune and help
   determine the future by thinking far ahead.

*** Law 30: Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless

   Your actions must seem natural and executed with
   ease.  All the toil and practice that go into
   them, and also all the clever tricks, must be
   concealed.  When you act, act effortlessly, as if
   you could do much more.  Avoid the temptation of
   revealing how hard you work – it only raises
   questions.  Teach no one your tricks or they will
   be used against you.

*** Law 31: Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards you Deal

   The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give
   the other person a choice: Your victims feel they
   are in control, but are actually your puppets.
   Give people options that come out in your favor
   whichever one they choose.  Force them to make
   choices between the lesser of two evils, both of
   which serve your purpose.  Put them on the horns
   of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.

*** Law 32: Play to People’s Fantasies

   The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and
   unpleasant.  Never appeal to truth and reality
   unless you are prepared for the anger that comes
   for disenchantment.  Life is so harsh and
   distressing that people who can manufacture
   romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in
   the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is
   great power in tapping into the fantasies of the
   masses.

*** Law 33: Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew

   Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall.
   That weakness is usual y an insecurity, an
   uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a
   small secret pleasure.  Either way, once found, it
   is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.

*** Law 34: Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated like one

   The way you carry yourself will often determine
   how you are treated; In the long run, appearing
   vulgar or common will make people disrespect you.
   For a king respects himself and inspires the same
   sentiment in others.  By acting regally and
   confident of your powers, you make yourself seem
   destined to wear a crown.

*** Law 35: Master the Art of Timing

   Never seem to be in a hurry – hurrying betrays a
   lack of control over yourself, and over time.
   Always seem patient, as if you know that
   everything will come to you eventually.  Become a
   detective of the right moment; sniff out the
   spirit of the times, the trends that will carry
   you to power.  Learn to stand back when the time
   is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it
   has reached fruition.

*** Law 36: Disdain Things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best Revenge

   By acknowledging a petty problem you give it
   existence and credibility.  The more attention you
   pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a
   small mistake is often made worse and more visible
   when you try to fix it.  It is sometimes best to
   leave things alone.  If there is something you
   want but cannot have, show contempt for it.  The
   less interest you reveal, the more superior you
   seem.

*** Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles

   Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures
   create the aura of power – everyone responds to
   them.  Stage spectacles for those around you, then
   full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that
   heighten your presence.  Dazzled by appearances,
   no one will notice what you are really doing.

*** Law 38: Think as you like but Behave like others

   If you make a show of going against the times,
   flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox
   ways, people will think that you only want
   attention and that you look down upon them.  They
   will find a way to punish you for making them feel
   inferior.  It is far safer to blend in and nurture
   the common touch. Share your originality only with
   tolerant friends and those who are sure to
   appreciate your uniqueness.

*** Law 39: Stir up Waters to Catch Fish

   Anger and emotion are strategically
   counterproductive.  You must always stay calm and
   objective.  But if you can make your enemies angry
   while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided
   advantage.  Put your enemies off-balance: Find the
   chink in their vanity through which you can rattle
   them and you hold the strings.

*** Law 40: Despise the Free Lunch

   What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually
   involves either a trick or a hidden obligation.
   What has worth is worth paying for.  By paying
   your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt,
   and deceit.  It is also often wise to pay the full
   price – there is no cutting corners with
   excellence.  Be lavish with your money and keep it
   circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet
   for power.

*** Law 41: Avoid Stepping into a Great Man’s Shoes

   What happens first always appears better and more
   original than what comes after.  If you succeed a
   great man or have a famous parent, you will have
   to accomplish double their achievements to
   outshine them.  Do not get lost in their shadow,
   or stuck in a past not of your own making:
   Establish your own name and identity by changing
   course.  Slay the overbearing father, disparage
   his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own
   way.

*** Law 42: Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep will Scatter

   Trouble can often be traced to a single strong
   individual – the stirrer, the arrogant underling,
   the poisoned of goodwill.  If you allow such
   people room to operate, others will succumb to
   their influence.  Do not wait for the troubles
   they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate
   with them – they are irredeemable.  Neutralize
   their influence by isolating or banishing them.
   Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep
   will scatter.

*** Law 43: Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others

   Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually
   work against you.  You must seduce others into
   wanting to move in your direction.  A person you
   have seduced becomes your loyal pawn.  And the way
   to seduce others is to operate on their individual
   psychologies and weaknesses.  Soften up the
   resistant by working on their emotions, playing on
   what they hold dear and what they fear.  Ignore
   the hearts and minds of others and they will grow
   to hate you.

*** Law 44: Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect

   The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the
   perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your
   enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot
   figure out your strategy.  The Mirror Effect mocks
   and humiliates them, making them overreact.  By
   holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce
   them with the illusion that you share their
   values; by holding up a mirror to their actions,
   you teach them a lesson.  Few can resist the power
   of Mirror Effect.

*** Law 45: Preach the Need for Change, but Never Reform too much at Once

   Everyone understands the need for change in the
   abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are
   creatures of habit.  Too much innovation is
   traumatic, and will lead to revolt.  If you are
   new to a position of power, or an outsider trying
   to build a power base, make a show of respecting
   the old way of doing things.  If change is
   necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement
   on the past.

*** Law 46: Never appear too Perfect

   Appearing better than others is always dangerous,
   but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no
   faults or weaknesses.  Envy creates silent
   enemies.  It is smart to occasionally display
   defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to
   deflect envy and appear more human and
   approachable.  Only gods and the dead can seem
   perfect with impunity.

*** Law 47: Do not go Past the Mark you Aimed for; In Victory, Learn when to Stop

   The moment of victory is often the moment of
   greatest peril.  In the heat of victory, arrogance
   and overconfidence can push you past the goal you
   had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more
   enemies than you defeat.  Do not allow success to
   go to your head.  There is no substitute for
   strategy and careful planning.  Set a goal, and
   when you reach it, stop.

*** Law 48: Assume Formlessness

   By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you
   open yourself to attack.  Instead of taking a form
   for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable
   and on the move.  Accept the fact that nothing is
   certain and no law is fixed.  The best way to
   protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as
   water; never bet on stability or lasting order.
   Everything changes.

** Roger Fisher
My favorite activity is inventing.  An early arms control proposal
dealt with the problem of distancing that the President would
have in the circumstance of facing a decision about nuclear war.
There is a young man, probably a Navy officer, who accompanies
the President.    This young man has a black attache case which
contains the codes that are needed to fire nuclear weapons.
I could see the President at a staff meeting considering nuclear
was as an abstract question.  He might conclude: "On SIOP Plan
One, the decision is affirmative.  Communicate the Alpha line
XYZ."  Such jargon holds what is involved at a distance.

My suggestion was quite simple: Put that needed code number in
a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to
the heart of a volunteer.  The volunteer would carry with him
a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President.
If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only
way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands,
to kill one human being.  The President says, "George, I'm sorry
but tens of millions must die."  He has to look at someone and
realize what death is -- what an innocent death is.  Blood on
the White House carpet.  It's reality brought home.

What I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon, they said,
"My God, that's terrible.  Having to kill someone would distort
the President's judgment.  He might never push the button."

It is not necessary for the public to know whether I am joking or whether I am serious,

A photographer went to a socialite party in New York.

"Sankara: Yes. You cannot carry out fundamental change without a certain amount of madness.
In this case, it comes from noncomformity, the courage to turn your back on the old formulas,

extreme clarity today. I want to be one of those madmen.

When wealth is passed off as merit, bad luck is seen as bad character.

about being murdered. But I worked on an operating principle of not letting these people steal my
right to speak out of fear, and that's how I'm continuing to operate. On the balance of things
I'd prefer not to be murdered, but if I have to go somehow, I guess standing up against Nazis in
2020 America isn't the worst reason.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

It is ironic that philosophy so easily arouses the fury of common sense by being mistaken for the very abstractness it struggles against. It is certainly better—as in prephilosophical knowledge so in philosophy—not to proceed without a measure of autonomy of thought in relation to its subject matter. The logical apparatus owes its immeasurable improvement beyond primitive consciousness to this autonomy. It contains, intensified, at the level of content, the force of enlightenment that marks the historical development of philosophy. Yet as it became autonomous and developed into an apparatus, thinking also became the prey of reification and congealed into a high-handed method. Cybernetic machines are a crude example of this. They graphically demonstrate to people the nullity of formalized thinking abstracted from its contents insofar as such machines perform better than thinking subjects much of what used to be the proud achievement of the method of subjective reason. Should thinking subjects passively transform themselves into the instruments of such formalization, then they virtually cease being subjects. They approach the machine in the guise of its imperfect replica. Philosophical thinking begins as soon as it ceases to content itself with cognitions that are predictable and from which nothing more emerges than what had been placed there beforehand. The humane significance of computers would be to unburden the thinking of living beings to the extent that thought would gain the freedom to attain a knowledge that is not already implicit.

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and
again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does
actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the
end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least
fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."

I expect that the House has heard of the little document, which is circulating, about the boat race between the NHS and a Japanese crew. Both sides tried hard to do well, but the Japanese won by a mile. The NHS was very discouraged and set up a consultancy. The consultancy came to the conclusion that the Japanese had eight people rowing and one steering, whereas the NHS had eight people steering and one rowing. The NHS appointed people to look at the problem and decided to reorganise the structure of the team so that there were three steering managers, three assistant steering managers and a director of steering services, and an incentive was offered to the rower to row harder. When the NHS lost a second race, it laid off the rower for poor performance and sold the boat. It gave the money it got from selling the boat to provide higher than average pay awards for the director of steering services.

 “With the myth of the State out of the way, the real mutuality and reciprocity of society and individual became clear. Sacrifice might be demanded of the individual, but never compromise: for though only the society could give security and stability, only the individual, the person, had the power of moral choice - the power of change, the essential function of life. The Odonian society was conceived as a permanent revolution, and revolution begins in the thinking mind.”

Nor do we have much else. We are sharers, not owners. We are not prosperous. None of us is rich. None of us is powerful. If it is Anarres you want, if it is the future you seek, then I tell you that you must come to it with empty hands. You must come to it alone, and naked, as the child comes into the world, into his future, without any past, without any property, wholly dependent on other people for his life.

"Commodified fantasy takes no risks: it invents nothing, but imitates and trivializes. It proceeds by depriving the old stories of their intellectual and ethical complexity, turning their action to violence, their actors to dolls, and their truth-telling to sentimental platitude. Heroes brandish their swords, lasers, wands, as mechanically as combine harvesters, reaping profits. Profoundly disturbing moral choices are sanitized, made cute, made safe. The passionately conceived ideas of the great storytellers are copied, stereotyped, reduced to toys, molded in bright-colored plastic, advertised, sold, broken, junked, replaceable, interchangeable.
What the commodifiers of fantasy count on and exploit is the insuperable imagination of the reader, child or adult, which gives even these dead things life - of a sort, for a while."
