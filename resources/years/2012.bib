 abstract = {Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the causal effect of health insurance on the utilization of care. Most studies cannot determine whether the large differences in healthcare utilization between the insured and the uninsured are due to insurance status or to other unobserved differences between the two groups. In this paper, we exploit a sharp change in insurance coverage rates that results from young adults “aging out” of their parents' insurance plans to estimate the effect of insurance coverage on the utilization of emergency department (ED) and inpatient services. Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and a census of emergency department records and hospital discharge records from seven states, we find that aging out results in an abrupt 5 to 8 percentage point reduction in the probability of having health insurance. We find that not having insurance leads to a 40 percent reduction in ED visits and a 61 percent reduction in inpatient hospital admissions. The drop in ED visits and inpatient admissions is due entirely to reductions in the care provided by privately owned hospitals, with particularly large reductions at for profit hospitals. The results imply that expanding health insurance coverage would result in a substantial increase in care provided to currently uninsured individuals.},

@book{Angus2012,
 abstract = {The Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse (18981979) studied with Martin Heidegger at Freiburg University from 1928 to 1932 and completed a dissertation on Hegels theory of historicity under Heideggers supervision. During these years, Marcuse wrote a number of provocative philosophical essays experimenting with the possibilities of Heideggerian Marxism. For a time he believed that Heideggers ideas could revitalize Marxism, providing a dimension of experiential concreteness that was sorely lacking in the German Idealist tradition. Ultimately, two events deterred Marcuse from completing this program: the 1932 publication of Marxs early economic and philosophical manuscripts, and Heideggers conversion to Nazism a year later. Heideggerian Marxism offers rich and fascinating testimony concerning the first attempt to fuse Marxism and existentialism.These essays offer invaluable insight concerning Marcuses early philosophical evolution. They document one of the centurys most important Marxist philosophers attempting to respond to the crisis of Marxism: the failure of the European revolution coupled with the growing repression in the USSR. In response, Marcuse contrived an imaginative and original theoretical synthesis: existential Marxism.},

Then, we illustrate important aspects of these pitfalls using examples from applying simulation modeling to military and managerial decision making and present possible solutions to them. Finally, we discuss how our suggestions for avoiding them relate to current methodological discussions found in the social simulation community.},

@article{Bengio2012,
 abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cumulative proportion of youth who self-report having been arrested or taken into custody for illegal or delinquent offenses (excluding arrests for minor traffic violations) from ages 8 to 23 years. METHODS: Self-reported arrest history data (excluding arrests for minor traffic violations) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (N = 7335) were examined from 1997 to 2008. RESULTS: By age 18, the in-sample cumulative arrest prevalence rate lies between 15.9% and 26.8%; at age 23, it lies between 25.3% and 41.4%. These bounds make no assumptions at all about missing cases. If we assume that the missing cases are at least as likely to have been arrested as the observed cases, the in-sample age-23 prevalence rate must lie between 30.2% and 41.4%. The greatest growth in the cumulative prevalence of arrest occurs during late adolescence and the period of early or emerging adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Since the last nationally defensible estimate based on data from 1965, the cumulative prevalence of arrest for American youth (particularly in the period of late adolescence and early adulthood) has increased substantially. At a minimum, being arrested for criminal activity signifies increased risk of unhealthy lifestyle, violence involvement, and violent victimization. Incorporating this insight into regular clinical assessment could yield significant benefits for patients and the larger community.},

 abstract = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

 abstract = {Scientific social trends ranging from dynamical systems theories to postmodernism have called into question whether the apparent hierarchical structure of naturally occurring intelligent behaviour actually derives from structured intelligence. These questions and perspectives overlook substantial evidence from both neuroscience and biology more broadly that behaviour really is organised utilising both modularity and hierarchy. In mammal brains, modular structure starts from cellular composition, and continues conspicuously through the existence of discrete regions with differing processing capacities (Badre, 2008). We can discriminate a brain region by its consistent and regular pattern of nerve-cell type and intercell connectivity, while these same features vary between regions. Hierarchy derives from the interaction between these modules. This is particularly apparent when we can produce complex movements such as the production of particular words (Mateer et al., 1990) or grasping and transfer gestures (Graziano et al., 2002) by directly stimulating single cells.},

@article{Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil2012,
 abstract = {Many online human activities leave digital traces that are recorded in natural-language format. The exploitation of this unprecedented resource under a computational frame- work can bring a phase transition in our understanding of human social behavior and shape the future of social media systems. This thesis describes a computational ap- proach to an intriguing aspect of conversational behavior, linguistic style coordination: conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles; a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance. We develop a probabilistic framework that can model and quantify this phenomenon and apply it to four different conversational settings: Twitter conversations, discussions betweenWikipedia editors, oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court and movie script dialogs. We are able to examine linguistic style coordination in large scale settings for the first time, and by doing so, to reveal important properties that were never observed in previous studies, which were conducted mainly in small and controlled environments. The resulting new understanding of conversational behavior bears practical impor- tance in the task of uncovering key properties of social relations. We present an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power re- lationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power — including a more “static” form of power based on status differences, and a more “situational” form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Finally, our computational framework can be employed to gain insight into the causal mechanism behind coordination behavior. It was previously hypothesized in the psycho-linguistic literature that coordination has arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status. But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to be- come a reflex? We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imag- ined characters do). Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus. We thereby provide evidence that lan- guage coordination is so implanted within our conception of conversational behavior that, even if such coordination is socially motivated, it is exhibited even when the per- son generating the language in question is not receiving any of the presumed social advantages.},

 abstract = {Kevin.Dill@lmco.com Eugene.Pursel@usmc.mil Pat.Garrity@us.army.mil Gino.Fragomeni@us.army.mil ABSTRACT There is an ongoing need for improved autonomous virtual characters for military training, particularly in areas such as squad-level scenarios for the Army and Marines. In the past, simulations have often used techniques such as scripting or Finite State Machines for Artificial Intelligence (AI) control of non-player characters. These approaches allow the scenario creator to have precise control over the actions of the characters, but the cost of configuration and the quality of the result scale poorly as the complexity of the AI grows. As a result, they tend to lead to AI behaviors that are rigid and predictable, and thus are insufficiently reactive to unexpected situations and not suitable for replay or repeated use. In previous papers we have endorsed utility-based AI as our preferred alternative. This approach enables the developer to think in terms of heuristic equations rather than simple black-and-white decisions, and thus to create an AI which can examine the subtle nuance of the situation and select actions accordingly. The resulting characters retain the strong authorial control of previous approaches, but they can be far more believable, adaptable, and reactive to the situation around themselves.},

This analysis contrast with the traditional lattice Boltzmann work, where complex fluids are considered with extended properties. Focus of the current thesis is on the validation and use of lattice Boltzmann method for traditional fluid dynamics. In first part of the document a historical and theoretical background of lattice Boltzmann method is presented. In this part some conclusions are drawn about the stability and other physical characteristics of the lattice Boltzmann method. Second part deals with the computer implementation of the LBM. It also discusses some aspect about practical usage of this method as a CFD tool. Boundary conditions are discussed in the same sections. Different method for boundary conditions and their numerical characteristics are presented. In the last section two numerical case studies are given for the lattice Boltzmann. Purpose of these numerical studies is to validate lattice Boltzmann method for traditional CFD application. Results of this numerical studies also reveals some facts about the physical aspect of lattice Boltzmann method.},

@article{Herley2010,
 abstract = {False positives cause many promising detection technologies to be unworkable in practice. Attackers, we show, face this problem too. In deciding who to attack true positives are targets successfully attacked, while false positives are those that are attacked but yield nothing. This allows us to view the attacker's problem as a binary classiﬁcation. The most proﬁtable strategy requires accurately distinguishing viable from non-viable users, and balancing the relative costs of true and false positives. We show that as victim density decreases the fraction of viable users than can be proﬁtably attacked drops dramatically. For example, a 10× reduction in density can produce a 1000× reduction in the number of victims found. At very low victim densities the attacker faces a seemingly intractable Catch-22: unless he can distinguish viable from non-viable users with great accuracy the attacker cannot ﬁnd enough victims to be proﬁtable. However, only by ﬁnding large numbers of victims can he learn how to accurately distinguish the two. Finally, this approach suggests an answer to the question in the title. Far-fetched tales of West African riches strike most as comical. Our analysis suggests that is an advantage to the attacker, not a disadvantage. Since his attack has a low density of victims the Nigerian scammer has an over-riding need to reduce false positives. By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select, and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favor.},

@article{High2012,
 abstract = {IBM Watson represents a first step into cognitive systems, a new era of computing. Watson builds on the current era of programmatic computing but differs in significant ways. The combination of the following capabilities makes Watson unique: (1) Natural language processing by helping to understand the complexities of unstructured data, which makes up as much as 80 percent of the data in the world today. (2) Hypothesis generation and evaluation by applying advanced analytics to weigh and evaluate a panel of responses based on only relevant evidence. (3) Dynamic learning by helping to improve learning based on outcomes to get smarter with each iteration and interaction Although none of these capabilities alone are unique to Watson, the combination delivers a powerful solution: (1) To move beyond the constraints of programmatic computing (2) To move from reliance on structured, local data to unlock the world of global, unstructured data (3) To move from decision tree-driven, deterministic applications to probabilistic systems that co-evolve with their users (4) To move from keyword-based search that provides a list of locations where an answer might (or might not) be located, to an intuitive, conversational means of discovering a set of confidence-ranked responses Cognitive systems, such as IBM Watson, can transform how organizations think, act, and operate in the future. This IBM Redguide publication describes how Watson combines natural language processing, dynamic learning, and hypothesis generation and evaluation to give direct, confidence-based responses.},

 abstract = {Level designers create gameplay through geometry, AI scripting, and item placement. There is little formal understanding of this process, but rather a large body of design lore and rules of thumb. As a result, there is no accepted common language for describing the building blocks of level design and the gameplay they create. This dissertation presents a set of level design patterns for first-person shooter (FPS) gaproviding cause-effect relationships between level design patterns and gameplay. These relationships are explored through analysis of data gathered in an extensive user study. This work is the first scientific study of level design, laying the foundation for further work in this area. Data driven approaches to understand gameplay have been attempted in the past, but this work takes it to a new level by showing specific cause- effect relationships between the design of the level and player behavior. The result of this dissertation is a resource for designers to help them understand how they are creating gameplay through their art. The pattern collection allows them to explore design space more fully and create richer and more varied experiences.},

 abstract = {Dance choreography is an intense, creative and intuitive process. A choreographer has to finalize appropriate dance steps from amongst millions of possibilities. Though it is not impossible, the choreographer being human cannot explore, analyze and remember all these variations among steps due to large scale of available options. Hence, we propose to simplify the problem of exploring and selecting dance steps from amongst the huge set of all possible variations for an Indian Classical Dance, BharataNatyam (BN). Based on a computational model developed by Jadhav et al. [13], we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) driven automatic system that would provide a list of unexplored novel dance steps to choreographers. We have incorporated certain measures to ensure that the proposed dance steps should be feasible and appropriate. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach to obtain unexplored dance steps using a proposed fitness function for a single beat/count. The details of experimental study performed for the Genetic Algorithm based art to SMart (System Modelled art) system along with the results obtained are also presented in this paper.},

 abstract = {Massively Multiplayer Online (Role-Playing) Games (MMORPGs and MMOs) are highly complex socio-technical distributed systems. The thickly knitted web of relations among players is the backbone upon which their success (or failure) lies. For this reason, both game designers and managers should be aware of how - even the thinnest - features of the environment will impact on players. We can enlist among these apparently "minor" aspects Looting Systems (LSs), which help allocating valuable in-game objects, as fairly as possible, among the players. In the present work, we try to cast some light on the medium/long term effects of the adoption of different LSs on players' satisfaction (and hence on their "fidelity" to a specific game service). We adopt an agent-based approach to simulate the effects and drawbacks of LSs on different player bases (according to Bartle's player types), demonstrating that a relation among LSs and players' satisfaction with the game service could really exists, and that an appropriate choice of the LS could affect the distribution of player types in the game community, thus offering hints for reflection and further investigation to MMOs/MMORPGs developers. © 2012 IEEE.},

@phdthesis{MitchellAlexa2012,
 abstract = {There are very particular reasons why people want to go back to reexperience stories, reasons which are not necessarily applicable to stories that change as the result of reader choice. This raises the question: what is known about re-reading – especially rereading in the context of interactive stories? Although there have been some discussions of rereading in non-interactive stories, and some implementations of interactive stories which are intended to be reexperienced, there has been very little work which directly addresses the nature of rereading in the context of interactive stories. Work on rereading in interactive stories tends to argue that people reread either to experience variation or to look for closure. Implementation efforts generally follow the former perspective. Previous work has not, however, investigated how rereading actually changes in the context of interactive stories. To address this issue, implementations of prototype hypertext stories were created, empirical studies were carried out on these stories, and critical analyses of existing theories and creative works were conducted. Based on an analysis of existing stories, a classification of motivations for rereading and a categorization of techniques for encouraging and rewarding rereading in interactive stories were developed. This was followed by two empir- ical studies of rereading of procedural hypertext fiction. The first study showed that, when rereading, readers are looking for some form of closure. The second study showed that readers have difficulty deciding whether or not what they are doing as they go back over an interactive story can be called “rereading”. From the insights gained in these studies, a new model of rereading in in- teractive stories is proposed. The model focuses on what the reader is doing when rereading. In this model, readers who are rereading to find closure are rereading to complete a “first” reading. It is only when readers achieve this closure that they can potentially shift to either rereading to reexperience the story, or rereading reflectively or analytically. This involves a change from doing the same thing each time the story is read, to doing something different. This shift highlights the paradoxical nature of rereading. Rereading, rather than in- volving reading something again, actually involves reading anew. This paradox is foregrounded in interactive stories, where what is being “reread” may literally be different on each rereading. This thesis contributes to the literature on interactive storytelling by a) ex- panding the research field to include study of the phenomenon of rereading, b) providing a model by which to both analyze and design interactive stories which are intended to be reread, and c) suggesting new ways to approach inter- active stories in general. In addition, this thesis contributes to the literature on rereading by a) extending the concept of rereading to interactive stories, and b) suggesting new ways of thinking about rereading in all forms of stories, whether static or interactive. Finally, the thesis contributes to methodology, by intro- ducing an approach to studying interactive stories using a modified Piagetian “clinical interview” combined with the creation of stories specifically designed to investigate reader behaviour.},

 abstract = {Since the advent of computers, the natural and engineering sciences have enormously progressed. Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction 1, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far 210. In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web},

@article{Monner2012,
 abstract = {The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a second-order recurrent neural network architecture that excels at storing sequential short-term memories and retrieving them many time-steps later. LSTM's original training algorithm provides the important properties of spatial and temporal locality, which are missing from other training approaches, at the cost of limiting its applicability to a small set of network architectures. Here we introduce the Generalized Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM-g) training algorithm, which provides LSTM-like locality while being applicable without modification to a much wider range of second-order network architectures. With LSTM-g, all units have an identical set of operating instructions for both activation and learning, subject only to the configuration of their local environment in the network; this is in contrast to the original LSTM training algorithm, where each type of unit has its own activation and training instructions. When applied to LSTM architectures with peephole connections, LSTM-g takes advantage of an additional source of back-propagated error which can enable better performance than the original algorithm. Enabled by the broad architectural applicability of LSTM-g, we demonstrate that training recurrent networks engineered for specific tasks can produce better results than single-layer networks. We conclude that LSTM-g has the potential to both improve the performance and broaden the applicability of spatially and temporally local gradient-based training algorithms for recurrent neural networks. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The intentional binding effect refers to the subjective compression of the temporal interval between a voluntary action and its external sensory consequence. Since the first report, considerable interest has been generated and a fascinating array of studies has accumulated. Much of the interest in intentional binding comes from the promise to shed light on human agency. In this review we survey studies on intentional binding, focusing, in particular, on the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency (the experience of controlling action to influence events in the environment). We suggest that, whilst it is yet to be fully explicated, the link between intentional binding and the sense of agency is compelling. We conclude by considering outstanding questions and future directions for research on intentional binding.},

 abstract = {World of Warcraft (WoW) is a popular Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) that requires gamers to play in one of two factions: the Horde or the Alliance. Although deemphasized in more recent versions of the game, the Horde has traditionally been considered the "evil" faction, whereas the Alliance has been considered the "good" faction. Researchers have identified differences between these two factions with respect to gameplay, although the mechanisms for these differences are unclear. The present study investigated whether faction-based differences extend to psychological traits and symptoms. The results indicated that members of the Horde obtained higher scores on measures of interpersonal dependency and three measures of problematic WoW use. Obsession with World of Warcraft was particularly salient in predicting faction membership, with higher scores on the obsession variable predicting membership to the Horde. Possible explanations for the observed differences are suggested, limitations are reviewed, and directions for future research are indicated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Agents that interact in complex social situations need to take the social context in consideration in order to perform believably. We argue that social identity is an important factor; therefore, agents should incorporate social identity theory in their behaviour, which implies the ability to cat- egorize others (and themselves) into social groups. In ad- dition, social situations often present social dilemmas with expected rational choices. Social identity may in uence the agent to deviate from the rational choice. However, in some situations the rational choice may be the expected, and be- lievable, behaviour. In fact, we argue that nding the dy- namics between the social bias induced by social identity and the rational motivation is one of the challenges of building believable agents. In all this, anticipation takes an impor- tant role, as it is important to understand the others to cope well with a social situation.},

@article{Schwartz2012,
 abstract = {This article presents an overview of the Schwartz theory of basic human values. It discusses the nature of values and spells out the features that are common to all values and what distinguishes one value from another. The theory identifies ten basic personal values that are recognized across cultures and explains where they come from. At the heart of the theory is the idea that values form a circular structure that reflects the motivations each value expresses. This circular structure, that captures the conflicts and compatibility among the ten values is apparently culturally universal. The article elucidates the psychological principles that give rise to it. Next, it presents the two major methods developed to measure the basic values, the Schwartz Value Survey and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Findings from 82 countries, based on these and other methods, provide evidence for the validity of the theory across cultures. The findings reveal substantial differences in the value priorities of individuals. Surprisingly, however, the average value priorities of most societal groups exhibit a similar hierarchical order whose existence the article explains. The last section of the article clarifies how values differ from other concepts used to explain behavior—attitudes, beliefs, norms, and traits},

 abstract = {You've experienced the shiny, point-and-click surface of your Linux computer—now dive below and explore its depths with the power of the command line. The Linux Command Line takes you from your very first terminal keystrokes to writing full programs in Bash, the most popular Linux shell. Along the way you'll learn the timeless skills handed down by generations of gray-bearded, mouse-shunning gurus: file navigation, environment configuration, command chaining, pattern matching with regular expressions, and more. In addition to that practical knowledge, author William Shotts reveals the philosophy behind these tools and the rich heritage that your desktop Linux machine has inherited from Unix supercomputers of yore. As you make your way through the book's short, easily-digestible chapters, you'll learn how to: Create and delete files, directories, and symlinks Administer your system, including networking, package installation, and process management Use standard input and output, redirection, and pipelines Edit files with Vi, the world's most popular text editor Write shell scripts to automate common or boring tasks Slice and dice text files with cut, paste, grep, patch, and sed Once you overcome your initial "shell shock," you'll find that the command line is a natural and expressive way to communicate with your computer. Just don't be surprised if your mouse starts to gather dust. Amazon.com Review Praise for The Linux Command Line "I can honestly say I have found THE beginner's guide to Linux." —Linux Journal "Anyone who reads this book and makes use of the examples provided will not be able to avoid becoming a Unix command line pro by the time they've hit the end of the book." —ITworld "The most approachable tome on the subject." —Linux Magazine "If you're new to the command line there is definitely a lot that you can learn from this book." —Ubuntu Musings "This is exactly what a Linux beginner needs to get up to speed quickly. The book goes beyond simply walking through all of the command line utilities, and ventures into the realm of theory and how things work together." —Nicholas C.

With the increased popularity of large story-driven interactive games, the demand for truly dynamic narrative systems has grown, while the number of cross-disciplinary experts that can both design compelling plots and utilize the underlying computational power has stayed relatively small. This work aims to develop a series of complete, publicly releasable authoring interfaces that allow novice, non- technical writers and game designers to easily author plan-based interactive stories, and thereby more closely connect these creative minds to concrete implementation of their ideas. Through a process of iterative development driven by constant evaluation and lessons learned from each subsequent system, we hope to develop a series of truly usable, writer-friendly, and powerful interactive story authoring environments, and at the same time gather valuable and widely applicable insight into the requirements of interfaces aimed at novice-oriented authoring.},

 abstract = {Games are shaped by the tools we use to make them and our ability to model the concepts they address. Vast improvements in computer graphics technology, processing power, storage capacity, and physics simulations have driven game design for the past forty years, leading to beautiful, spacious, detailed, and highly immersive worlds supporting games that are, for the most part, fundamentally about movement, collision, and other physics-based concepts. Designers use increasingly complex tools that support the creation of these worlds. The games industry is undoubtedly thriving on these technologies, but what comes next? The tools that game designers use today are highly complex--too complex for a growing population of novice designers, and offering little support for reasoning about gameplay--and there are entire genres of games that cannot be made using the tools available to us now. This dissertation presents the use of procedural content generation to create \textlessbold\textgreaterexpressive design tools\textless/bold\textgreater: content generators that are accessible to designers, supporting the creation of new kinds of design tools and enabling the exploration of a new genre of game involving the deep integration of procedural content generation into game mechanics and aesthetics. The first of these tools is Tanagra, the first ever AI-assisted level design tool that supports a designer creating levels for 2D platforming games. Tanagra guarantees that levels created in the tool are playable, and provides the designer with the ability to modify generated levels and directly control level pacing. The second tool is Launchpad, which supports a designer controlling both component and pacing features of generated levels; its companion game \textlessitalic\textgreaterEndless Web\textless/italic\textgreater uses the generator to create an infinite world for players to explore and alter through their choices. \textlessitalic\textgreaterEndless Web\textless/italic\textgreater is one of a handful of games in a new genre enabled by content generation: PCG-based games. Finally, this dissertation presents a novel method for understanding, visualizing, and comparing a generator's expressive range, thus allowing designers to understand the implications of decisions they will make during the design process.},

 abstract = {Some problems in procedural content generation for games involve hard constraints (e.g. that a generated puzzle is necessarily solvable). Common techniques for generator design lack a way to specify crisp (yes/no) constraints on what counts as a valid content artifact and guarantee these constraints are satisfied in the generator's output. In this paper we present two independent implementations of three diverse level design automation tools for the popular online educational game Refraction. All of the systems guarantee key properties of their output. Applying a constraint-focused generator design perspective in depth, we found that even emergent aesthetic style properties were straightforward to directly control. Our results with Refraction provide further concrete evidence for the claim that the expressive power of constraints and the ease with which they can be incorporated into suitably designed generative processes makes them a powerful tool for producing reliably-controllable generators for game content.},

 abstract = {Game design is an art form that deals with inherently interactive artifacts. Game designers craft games (assembled from rule systems and content), but they really seek to manipulate play: the interaction between games and players. When developing new games that are similar to past games, a designer may rely on previous experience with related designs and relatively easy access to players familiar with conventional design choices. When exploratorily venturing into uncharted territory, uncovering games that afford novel modes of play, there is a need for practical and technological interventions that improve a designer's access to feedback from the unfamiliar design scenario. In the interdisciplinary space between game design, design studies, computational creativity, and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), my program of mechanizing exploratory game design aims to amplify human creativity in game design; enable new game designs through deep, play-time design automation; and demonstrate novel tools that respect the concerns of design problems.},

 abstract = {Haskell is a language that differs greatly from the mainstream languages of today. An emphasis on pure functions, a strong typing system, and a lack of loops and other conventional features make it harder to learn for programmers familiar only with imperative programming. One particular problem I faced during my initial contact with Haskell was unclear error messages. Later, seeing some discussions on #haskell, I noticed that I wasn't the only one. Correcting a program without understanding error messages is not an easy task. In this tutorial, I aim to remedy this problem by explaining how to understand Haskell's error messages. I will present code snippets that generate errors, followed by explanations and solutions. I used GHC 7.4.1 and Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0 [1] for demonstration. I assume reader's working knowledge of GHCi. I also assume that reader knows how data types are constructed, what type classes are and how they are used. Knowledge of monads and language extensions is not required},

 abstract = {Design patterns have proven useful in many creative fields, providing content creators with archetypal, reusable guidelines to leverage in projects. Creating such patterns, however, is a time-consuming, manual process, typically relegated to a few experts in any given domain. In this paper, we describe an algorithmic method for learning design patterns directly from data using techniques from natural language processing and structured concept learning. Given a set of labeled, hierarchical designs as input, we induce a probabilistic formal grammar over these exemplars. Once learned, this grammar encodes a set of generative rules for the class of designs, which can be sampled to synthesize novel artifacts. We demonstrate the method on geometric models and Web pages, and discuss how the learned patterns can drive new interaction mechanisms for content creators. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

@article{Thorisson2012,
 abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has to date been largely one of manual labor. This constructionist approach to AI has resulted in systems with limited-domain application and severe performance brittleness. No AI architecture to date incorporates, in a single system, the many features that make natural intelligence general-purpose, including system-wide attention, analogy-making, system-wide learning, and various other complex transversal functions. Going beyond current AI systems will require significantly more complex system architecture than attempted to date. The heavy reliance on direct human specification and intervention in constructionist AI brings severe theoretical and practical limitations to any system built that way. One way to address the challenge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is replacing a top-down architectural design approach with methods that allow the system to manage its own growth. This calls for a fundamental shift from hand-crafting to self-organizing architectures and self-generated code – what we call a constructivist AI approach, in reference to the self-constructive principles on which it must be based. Methodologies employed for constructivist AI will be very different from today's software development methods; instead of relying on direct design of mental functions and their implementation in a cognitive architecture, they must address the principles – the “seeds” – from which a cognitive architecture can automatically grow. In this paper I describe the argument in detail and examine some of the implications of this impending paradigm shift.},

@article{Tsai2012,
 abstract = {In social psychology, emotional contagion describes the widely observed phenomenon of one person's emotions mimicking surrounding people's emotions [10]. In this paper, we perform a battery of experiments to explore the existence of agent-human emotional contagion. The first study is a between-subjects design, wherein subjects were shown an image of a character's face with either a neutral or happy expression. Findings indicate that even a still image induces a very strong increase in self-reported happiness between Neutral and Happy conditions with all characters tested. In a second study, we examine the effect of a virtual character's presence in a strategic decision by presenting subjects with a modernized Stag Hunt game. Our experiments show that the contagion effect is substantially dampened and does not cause a consistent impact on behavior. A third study explores the impact of the strategic situation within the Stag Hunt and conducts the same experiment using a description of the same strategic situation with the decision already made. We find that the emotional impact returns, implying that the contagion effect is substantially lessened in the presence of a strategic decision.},

@article{VanBaar2012,
 abstract = {This paper discusses recent profound transformations in the post-socialist governance of welfare states and their impact on the Roma, Europe&#039;s most marginalised and vulnerable minority. Discussing the consequences of the recent transition of social policy in East Central Europe from the angle of a shift from Communist welfare societies to post-1989 active societies shows how these changes have simultaneously inaugurated new approaches to the region&#039;s Romani minorities. Through an analysis of how neo-liberal forms of governmentality have ambiguously been cross-fertilised with new and renewed patterns and techniques of welfare governance in Slovakia, this paper calls into question the current emphasis on activating supposedly &#039;inactive&#039; Roma. This examination reveals that the introduction of allegedly politically neutral technologies and forms of expertise to improve the Roma&#039;s socio-economic mobility has actually resulted in disputable forms of Romani minority governance, including the dehumanisation of some of the most marginalised members of this minority. To challenge these practices, this paper advocates a break with the persistent policy-centric trend in Roma-related research. Redirecting research beyond the dominant focus on discrepancies between policies and their implementation, it is argued, potentially offers valuable insights into our understanding of the complex relationship between policy failures and the revitalisation of marginalising practices.},
