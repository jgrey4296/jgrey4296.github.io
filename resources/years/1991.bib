 abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation. When intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict reliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and action, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline our approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures. The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate-everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments. ?? 1991.},

@article{Shivers1991,
 abstract = {Programswritten in powerful, higher-order languages like Scheme,ML, and CommonLisp should run as fast as their FORTRAN and C counterparts. They should, but they don't. A major reason is the level of optimisation applied to these two classes of languages. Many FORTRAN and C compilers employ an arsenal of sophisticated global optimisations that depend upon data-flow analysis: common-subexpression elimination, loop-invariant detection, induction-variable elimination, and many, many more. Compilers for higher- order languages do not provide these optimisations. Without them, Scheme, LISP and ML compilers are doomed to produce code that runs slower than their FORTRAN and C counterparts. The problem is the lack of an explicit control-flow graph at compile time, somethingwhich traditional data-flow analysis techniques require. In this dissertation, I present a technique for recovering the control-flowgraph of aScheme programat compile time. I give examples of how this information can be used to perform several data-flow analysis optimisations, including copy propagation, induction-variable elimination, useless-variable elimination, and type recovery. The analysis is defined in termsof a non-standard semantic interpretation. The denotational semantics is carefully developed, and several theorems establishing the correctness of the semantics and the implementing algorithms are proven.},

@book{Stolfo1991,
 abstract = {Although the problem of increasing the speed of rule-based programs has been studied for a long while, so far the level of parallelism achieved under various parallel processing schemes fails to meet expectations of high performance gains. Most of the work has focused on manipulating existing rule programs to accommodate parallel architectures. However, without changing the inherently sequential algorithms encoded in rule form and without using intrinsic parallel rule languages to exploit parallelism, speedup is severely limited. In this paper we demonstrate that to maximize parallelism, manipulations must take place at the algorithmic level in addition to the program level. However, traditional rule languages are not equipped to easily express parallel algorithms. Thus, an inherently parallel rule language must be devised to enable maximum parallelism. We present our initial specification of such a language, named PARULEL. Preliminary performance results are detailed for one test case program. PARULEL is one part of a larger research effort that considers four key approaches to parallel rule processing: inherently parallel execution semantics; the use of redaction meta-rules to allow programmer control of the set of parallel instantiations; an incremental evaluation algorithm that incorporates, in an efficient manner, updates to the initial set of assumptions; and an algorithm that maps a program to a parallel architecture. © 1991.},
