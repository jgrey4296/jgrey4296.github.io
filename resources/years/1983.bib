@article{Clark1983,
 abstract = {Most theories of comprehension assume that every word in an utterance is comprehended by selecting its intended sense from a short exhaustive list of potential senses in the mental lexicon. This assumption is challenged by novel words based on proper nouns, as in After Joe listened to the tape of the interview, he did a Richard Nixon to a portion of it i.e., erased. Experiment 1 demonstrated that people interpret verb phrases like do a Nixon against a hierarchy of information assumed to be shared by the speaker and his addressees: Nixon's identity; acts associated with Nixon; types of acts appropriate to the utterance; and the type of act specifically intended. Experiment 2 demonstrated that people expect the intended type of act to be coherent, and to be salient among the acts associated with Nixon. It is argued that creating senses, as with do a Nixon, works differently from selecting senses, and that many words require a mixture of both. © 1983 Academic Press, Inc.},

@article{Gentner1983,
 abstract = {A theory of analogy must describe how the meaning of an analogy is derived from the meanings of its parts. In the structure-mapping theory, the interpretation rules are characterized as implicit rules for mapping knowledge about a base domain into a target domain. Two important features of the theory are (a) the rules depend only on syntactic properties of the knowledge representation, and not on the specific content of the domains; and (b) the theoretical framework allows analogies to be distinguished cleanly from literal similarity statements, applications of abstractions, and other kinds of comparisons. Two mapping principles are described: (a) Relations between objects, rather than attributes of objects, are mapped from base to target; and (b) The particular relations mapped are determined by systematicity, as defined by the existence of higher-order relations.},

 abstract = {Ever since Descartes, philosophically minded people have wrestled with the question of whether it is possible for machines to think. As we interact more and more with computers -- both personal computers and others -- the questions of whether machines can think and what kind of thoughts they can have become ever more pertinent. We can ask whether machines remember, believe, know, intend, like or dislike, want, understand, promise, owe, have rights or duties, or deserve rewards or punishment. Is this an all-or-nothing question, or can we say that some machines do some of these things and not others, or that they do them to some extent?},
