They are established tools in a wide range of industrial applications, including search engines, DNA sequencing, stock market analysis, and robot locomotion, and their use is spreading rapidly. People who know the methods have their choice of rewarding jobs. This hands-on text opens these opportunities to computer science students with modest mathematical backgrounds. It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

We argue that social simulation of this practice of cooperation can help in understanding further this new way of doing science, building on existing experience in simulation of knowledge flows as well as pragmatic approaches in social sciences.},

With an artful mixture of chatty style and interesting examples, the student's previous intuitive knowledge is placed on solid intellectual ground. The topics covered include: integers, induction, algorithms, real numbers, rational numbers, modular arithmetic, limits, and uncountable sets. Methods, such as axiom, theorem and proof, are taught while discussing the mathematics rather than in abstract isolation. The book ends with short essays on further topics suitable for seminar-style presentation by small teams of students, either in class or in a mathematics club setting. These include: continuity, cryptography, groups, complex numbers, ordinal number, and generating functions.},

@report{bittar11_unloc_gates_alexan_,
 abstract     = {New technologies can often disrupt the balance between public and private interests in copyright law. For example, the Internet has facilitated the dissemination of artistic works by allowing users to mass distribute files within seconds. In response, the entertainment industry has turned to digital rights management (DRM) as one way of combating piracy. DRM is a technique that allows copyright owners to enforce their rights by controlling what users can do with their digital files, such as by restricting the platform on which the file can be accessed. In addition, the DRM scheme is protected by anti-circumvention laws, which prevent users from "breaking" the DRM. Although the main goal of DRMs is to prevent piracy, this technique can adversely impact other interests, such as privacy and fair use. This result is apparent in the e-book market, where it affects competition. More specifically, since each bookseller uses a different proprietary DRM scheme on their ebooks, compatible with a limited number of reading platforms, consumers face problems with interoperability. For example, a Kindle owner cannot buy books from Barnes \& Noble, and a Nook owner cannot buy books from Apple. This lack of interoperability can increase barriers to entry, switching costs, and network effects. Consequently, consumers are often locked into an e-book ecosystem, which permits booksellers to act as gatekeepers of the e-book market. Moreover, this situation can undermine the potential of e-books to spread knowledge, promote literacy, and extend the reach of literature. Examining the effects of DRM in the e-book market, this paper will discuss the equilibrium between three different public policies: the protection of copyrighted works, the promotion of market competition and the fostering of a free and robust cultural environment.},

Cultural materials are presented in integrated ethnographic case studies organized by cultural and geographic areas to show how ideological, social organization, and material features fit together in specific sociocultural systems. Bodley explicitly seeks a balance between ecological-materialist and cultural-ideological explanations of sociocultural systems, while stressing the importance of individual power-seeking and human agency. Part One examines domestic-scale, autonomous tribal cultures. Part Two presents politically organized, class-based civilizations and ancient empires in the imperial world. Part Three surveys global, industrial, market-based civilizations in the contemporary commercial world. Cultural Anthropology uniquely challenges students to consider the big questions about the nature of cultural systems.},

@inproceedings{brown11_heter_paral_framew_domain_specif_languag_,
 abstract     = {Computing systems are becoming increasingly parallel and heterogeneous, and therefore new applications must be capable of exploiting parallelism in order to continue achieving high performance. However, targeting these emerging devices often requires using multiple disparate programming models and making decisions that can limit forward scalability. In previous work we proposed the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to provide high-level abstractions that enable transformations to high performance parallel code without degrading programmer productivity. In this paper we present a new end-to-end system for building, compiling, and executing DSL applications on parallel heterogeneous hardware, the Delite Compiler Framework and Runtime. The framework lifts embedded DSL applications to an intermediate representation (IR), performs generic, parallel, and domain-specific optimizations, and generates an execution graph that targets multiple heterogeneous hardware devices. Finally we present results comparing the performance of several machine learning applications written in OptiML, a DSL for machine learning that utilizes Delite, to C++ and MATLAB implementations. We find that the implicitly parallel OptiML applications achieve single-threaded performance comparable to C++ and outperform explicitly parallel MATLAB in nearly all cases.},

@report{budiu11_usabil_,
 abstract     = {It looks like a giant iPhone, is the first thing users say when asked to test an iPad. (Their second comment? Wow, its heavy.) But from an interaction design perspective, an iPad user interface shouldnt be a scaled-up iPhone UI. Indeed, one finding from our study is that the tab bar at the bottom of the screen works much worse on iPad than on iPhone. On the small phone, users are likely to notice the muted icons at the bottom of the screen, even if their attention is on content in the middle of the screen. But the iPads much bigger screen means that users are typically directing their gaze far from the tab bar and they ignore (and forget) those buttons. Another big difference between iPad and iPhone is that regular websites work reasonably well on the big tablet. In our iPhone usability studies, users strongly prefer using apps to going on the Web. Its simply too painful to use most websites on the small screen. (Mobile- optimized sites alleviate this issue, but even they usually have worse usability than apps.) The iPads bigger screen offers reasonable usability for regular Web pages. Of course, theres still the fat finger problem common to all touch screens, which makes it hard for users to reliably hit small targets. The iPad has a readtap asymmetry, where text big enough to be read is too small to touch. Thus, we definitely recommend large touch zones on any Web page hoping to attract many iPad users. Also, most Web pages offer a rich and overstuffed experience compared to the iPads sparse and regulated environment; when an iPad app suddenly launches users onto the Web, the transition can be jarring. For more than a decade, when we ask users for their first impression of (desktop) websites, the most frequently-used word has been busy. In contrast, the first impression of many iPad apps is beautiful. The change to a more soothing user experience is certainly welcome, especially for a device that may turn out to be more of a leisure computer than a business computer. Still, beauty shouldnt come at the cost of being able to actually use the apps to derive real benefits from their features and content.},

@article{burke11_hearin_school_47,
 abstract     = {In recent years sensory history has emerged as a research topic of growing interest to historians and has been accompanied by a call to incorporate the senses into our understanding of the past. Under modernity, social direction and control were built into the infrastructure of modern life as specialist institutions emerged and multiplied in the urban landscape; institutions which were designed to discipline, control and shape urban bodies - the prison, the workhouse, the asylum, the reformatory, the children's home and the school. This paper focuses on one of these sites of childhood control: the school. Historians of education and childhood have to date paid little attention to the sensory worlds of schooling and childhood. This study focuses on one sense - hearing. Hearing, sound and aurality have been shown to be deeply implicated in modernity's daily elaboration. The study explores the sounds of modern schooling; the culture of listening in modern schools; the materiality of the modern school "soundscape"; and the influence of architectural acoustics on the culture of listening. In doing so, the study addresses the problems, sources and methodologies involved in writing a history of the hearing school.},

This language has been used with success in industry to systematically translate large, complex, and often erroneous requirements documents into a structured model of the system. It contains a mixture of state-based manipulations, synchronisation, message passing, and parallel, conditional, and iterative control structures. The formal semantics of a Behavior Tree is given via a translation to a version of Hoare's process algebra CSP, extended with state-based constructs such as guards and updates, and a message passing facility similar to that used in publish/subscribe protocols. We first provide the extension of CSP and its operational semantics, which preserves the meaning of the original CSP operators, and then the Behavior Tree notation and its translation into the extended version of CSP. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Second, any mention of a myth should be preceded by explicit warnings to notify the reader that the upcoming information is false. Finally, the refutation should include an alternative explanation that accounts for important qualities in the original misinformation.},

@article{corapi11_normat_desig_using_induc_learn_11,
 abstract     = {\textlessp\textgreaterIn this paper we propose a use-case-driven iterative design methodology for normative frameworks, also called virtual institutions, which are used to govern open systems. Our computational model represents the normative framework as a logic program under answer set semantics (ASP). By means of an inductive logic programming approach, implemented using ASP, it is possible to synthesise new rules and revise the existing ones. The learning mechanism is guided by the designer who describes the desired properties of the framework through use cases, comprising (i) event traces that capture possible scenarios, and (ii) a state that describes the desired outcome. The learning process then proposes additional rules, or changes to current rules, to satisfy the constraints expressed in the use cases. Thus, the contribution of this paper is a process for the elaboration and revision of a normative framework by means of a semi-automatic and iterative process driven from specifications of (un)desirable behaviour. The process integrates a novel and general methodology for theory revision based on ASP.\textless/p\textgreater},

Our semantics captures the intuition that the fulfilment or violation of an expectation must be determined without recourse to information from later states. We define a means of updating expectations from one state to the next based on formula progression, and show how conformance checking was implemented by extending the MCLITE and MCFULL algorithms of the Hybrid Logics Model Checker. 1},

Focusing on contemporary first- and third-player video games, it examines how digital imagery inscribes bodily dimensions onto a nonindexical world and the different ways in which we inhabit cinematic and electronic space. More specifically, it draws upon the writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to build a phenomenological model of bodies in digital imagery and argues that video gaming is a fully embodied, sensuous, carnal activity.},

@article{cruces11_biased_percep_incom_distr_prefer_redis_98,
 abstract     = {Individual perceptions of income distribution play a vital role in political economy and public finance models, yet there is little evidence regarding their origins or accuracy. This study examines how individuals form these perceptions and explores their potential impact on preferences for redistribution. A tailored household survey provides original evidence on systematic biases in individuals' evaluations of their own relative position in the income distribution. The study discusses one of the mechanisms that may generate such biases, based on the extrapolation of information from endogenous reference groups, and presents some suggestive evidence that this mechanism has significant explanatory power. The impact of these biased perceptions on attitudes toward redistributive policies is studied by means of an experimental design that was incorporated into the survey, which provided consistent information on the own-ranking within the income distribution to a randomly selected group of respondents. The evidence suggests that those who had overestimated their relative position and thought that they were relatively richer than they were tend to demand higher levels of redistribution when informed of their true ranking. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@inproceedings{danescu-niculescu-mizil11_echoes_,
 abstract     = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

Using the case of Four Winds Festival Bermagui, New South Wales, the paper discusses our use of "sound diaries" as a means to better understand the role of sound in participants' understanding of place. Highlighted within our discussion is how our experimental methodology overcomes some of the inherent problems of researching so-called "sound geographies." Sound diaries provide a possible technique to provide partial insights into the embodied knowledge triggered by sounds and music. Woven within these personal interpretations and their attributed meanings are more general themes concerning the concept of soundscapes, practices of listening, the role of sound in the mutual constitution of place and identities, and the embodied underpinnings of place-making practices in relation to sound and music.},

In the past, technological advances such as improved graphics and new controllers have driven the creation of new forms of gameplay, but games have still not made great strides into new gameplay experiences. We argue that the development of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) systems plays a crucial role in the exploration of currently unreachable spaces. To aid in exploration, we suggest a practice called AI-based game design, an iterative design process that deeply integrates the affordances of an AI system within the context of game design. We have applied this process in our own projects, and in this paper we present how it has pushed the boundaries of current game genres and experiences, as well as discuss the future AI-based game design.},

@inproceedings{everaere11_contin_2,
 abstract     = {We have investigated the use of continuous alternatives for action selection by a behavior-oriented agent. Such an agent is made of concurrent "behaviors"; each of these behaviors reacts to specific stimuli and provides a response according to a low-level goal. Since the behaviors are specialized, they can provide concurrent responses and conflicts among them must be solved to perform a coherent global behavior of the agent. In this context, voting methods allow to select only one of the responses of the behaviors, while taking into account their preferences and respecting all of their constraints. Previous works are based on action spaces limited to few discrete values and have shown difficulties in determining the behaviors weights for the vote. Furthermore, these works generally not allow to express the indifference of a behavior on a alternative's component, i.e. the fact that a behavior has no preference on the value of one component of an alternative. We propose in this article a method to use continuous values for the alternatives and a fair vote based on one alternative proposition per behavior. Our framework also allows the expression of indifference between alternatives.

@article{falcone11_trust_relat_capit_17,
 abstract     = {Trust can be viewed at the same time as an instrument both for an agent selecting the right partners in order to achieve its own goals, and for an agent of being selected from other potential partners in order to establish with them a cooperation/collaboration and to take advantage from the accumulated trust. In this paper we will analyze trust as the agents' relational capital. Starting from the classical dependence network with potential partners, we introduce the analysis of what it means for an agent to be trusted and how this condition could be strategically used from it for achieving its own goals, that is, why it represents a form of power. The idea of taking another agent's point of view is especially important if we consider the amount of studies in social science that connect trust with social capital related issues. Although there is a big interest in literature about 'social capital' and its powerful effects on the wellbeing of both societies and individuals, often it is not clear enough what is it the object under analysis. Individual trust capital (relational capital) and collective trust capital not only should be disentangled, but their relations are quite complicated and even conflicting. To overcome this gap, we propose a study that first attempts to understand what trust is as capital of individuals. In which sense "trust" is a capital. How this capital is built, managed and saved. In particular, how this capital is the result of the others' beliefs and goals. Then we aim to analytically study the cognitive dynamics of this object.},

 abstract     = {Resistance training produces an array of health benefits, as well as the potential to promote muscular adaptations of strength, size, power and endurance. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) regularly publish a position stand making recommendations for optimal achievement of the desired training goals. However, the most recent position stand (as well as previous ones) has come under heavy criticism for misrepresentation of research, lack of evidence and author bias. Therefore this paper proposes a set of scientifically rigorous resistance training guidelines, reviewing and summarising the relevant research for the purpose of proposing more logical, evidence-based training advice. We recommend that appreciably the same muscular strength and endurance adaptations can be attained by performing a single set of ̃8-12 repetitions to momentary muscular failure, at a repetition duration that maintains muscular tension throughout the entire range of motion, for most major muscle groups once or twice each week. All resistance types (e.g. free-weights, resistance machines, bodyweight, etc.) show potential for increases in strength, with no significant difference between them, although resistance machines appear to pose a lower risk of injury. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that balance from free weights or use of unstable surfaces shows any transference to sporting improvement, and explosive movements are also not recommended as they present a high injury risk and no greater benefit than slow, controlled weight training. Finally, we consider genetic factors in relation to body type and growth potential.},

Improvised theatrical performance is an activity in which one or more individuals create a dramatic or comedic performance in real-time and is an interesting example of creative, real-time, collaborative problem solving. Unlike other forms of creative problem solving, improvisers are constrained from explicitly coordinating with the other improvisers on stage or revising their decisions after the fact. This article focuses on the means by which a group of improvisers converge on a shared understanding (i.e. a shared mental model) of what a scene is about and how it should proceed. We present our findings on how improvisers build shared mental models during a performance and discuss our applications of these findings to the design and development of improvisational intelligent agents.},

To address this challenge, we investigate a method to codify, analyze, and trace relationships among requirements from different regulations that share a common theme of data breach notification. To measure gaps and overlaps between regulations, we applied previously validated requirements metrics. Our findings include a formalization of the legal landscape using operational constructs for high- and low-watermark practices, which business analysts and system developers can use to reason about compliance trade-offs based on perceived businesses costs and risks. We discovered and validated these constructs using five U.S. state data breach notification laws that govern transactions of financial and health information of state residents.},

The participants comprised 16 adult female casual-gamers who completed two self-report online interviews (at the beginning and at the end of the study) and participated in an online blog/diary and discussion forum over a four-week period. The data were analysed for salient themes using Thematic Analysis. Results showed areas that were important to female casual-gamers included knowledge peripheral to games, domestic commitments and personal priorities influenced by gaming, and the social, financial, and emotional investment of games. By exploring the prominent themes underlying women&rsquo;s motivations to play casual games, the results provided potential new research directions for future research on women gamers from positively gendered perspectives.},

 abstract     = {It is important to develop an understanding of children's engagement and choices in learning experiences outside of school as this has implications for their development and orientations to other learning environments. This mixed-methods study examines relationships between the genres of video games children choose to play and the learning strategies they employ to improve at these games. It also explores students' motivations for playing the games they choose to play. One hundred eighteen fourth- and fifth-grade students participated in this study. Qualitative analyses of student responses resulted in a model for classifying motivation for game choices. Children primarily cite reasons that can be classified as psychological or cognitive reasons for choosing to play certain video games, and are motivated by the challenge and thinking required in the games. Analyses using Chi-square tests of association demonstrated significant relationships between video game genre and learning strategy used for two of the six learning strategies (p \textless .05). Children playing action games are more likely to use repetition to learn the game and children playing adventure games are more likely to use their imaginations to take on the role of the character in the game and think the way the character would to make decisions in the game. There were also several gender differences in learning preferences. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Previously we have reported on an engine that imbues game agents with socially reactive behavior based on a continuous steering framework and a model of human territoriality. However, some social action requires deliberation and planning. In this paper we describe an addition to our engine that provides dynamic social planning on top of the reactive layer. We propose a novel approach that considers both the emotional and social impact of events and actions on the agent. An implementation demonstrates the approach. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

 abstract     = {The ability to achieve ones goals is a defining characteristic of intelligent behaviour. A great many existing theories, systems and research programmes address the problems associated with generating behaviour to achieve a goal; much fewer address the related problems of how and why goals should be generated in an intelligent artifact, and how a subset of all possible goals are selected as the focus of behaviour. It is research into these problems of motivation, which this article aims to stimulate. Building from the analysis of a scenario involving a futuristic household robot, we extend an existing account of motivation in intelligent systems to provide a framework for surveying relevant literature in AI and robotics. This framework guides us to look at the problems of encoding drives (how the needs of the system are represented), goal generation (how particular instances of goals are generated from the drives with reference to the current state), and goal selection (how the system determines which goal instances to act on). After surveying a variety of existing approaches in these terms, we build on the results of the survey to sketch a design for a new motive management framework which goes beyond the current state of the art. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{helbing11_how_to_do_agent_based_simul_futur_,
 abstract     = {Since the advent of computers, the natural and engineering sciences have enormously progressed. Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction 1, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far 210. In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web},

 abstract     = {Why do members of the public disagree - sharply and persistently - about facts on which expert scientists largely agree? We designed a study to test a distinctive explanation: the cultural cognition of scientific consensus. The 'cultural cognition of risk' refers to the tendency of individuals to form risk perceptions that are congenial to their values. The study presents both correlational and experimental evidence confirming that cultural cognition shapes individuals' beliefs about the existence of scientific consensus, and the process by which they form such beliefs, relating to climate change, the disposal of nuclear wastes, and the effect of permitting concealed possession of handguns. The implications of this dynamic for science communication and public policy-making are discussed.

We present a minimal, mobile and fully functional lambent display that clips onto any shopping trolley handle, intended to nudge people when choosing what to buy. It provides salient information about the food miles for various scanned food items represented by varying lengths of lit LEDs on the handle and a changing emoticon comparing the average miles of all the products in the trolley against a social norm. When evaluated in situ, the lambent handle display nudged people to choose products with fewer food miles than the items they selected using their ordinary shopping strategies. People also felt guilty when the average mileage of the contents of their entire shopping trolley was above the social norm. The findings are discussed in terms of how to provide different kinds of product information that people care about, using simple lambent displays.},

@book{kassirer11_refer_manual_scien_eviden_,
 abstract     = {The Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, Third Edition, assists judges in managing cases involving complex scientific and technical evidence by describing the basic tenets of key scientific fields from which legal evidence is typically derived and by providing examples of cases in which that evidence has been used. First published in 1994 by the Federal Judicial Center, the Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence has been relied upon in the legal and academic communities and is often cited by various courts and others. Judges faced with disputes over the admissibility of scientific and technical evidence refer to the manual to help them better understand and evaluate the relevance, reliability and usefulness of the evidence being proffered. The manual is not intended to tell judges what is good science and what is not. Instead, it serves to help judges identify issues on which experts are likely to differ and to guide the inquiry of the court in seeking an informed resolution of the conflict. The core of the manual consists of a series of chapters (reference guides) on various scientific topics, each authored by an expert in that field. The topics have been chosen by an oversight committee because of their complexity and frequency in litigation. Each chapter is intended to provide a general overview of the topic in lay terms, identifying issues that will be useful to judges and others in the legal profession. They are written for a non-technical audience and are not intended as exhaustive presentations of the topic. Rather, the chapters seek to provide judges with the basic information in an area of science, to allow them to have an informed conversation with the experts and attorneys.},

@article{kim11_comput_model_worker_protes_14,
 abstract     = {This paper presents an agent-based model of worker protest. Workers have varying degrees of grievance depending on the difference between their wage and the average of their neighbors. They protest with probabilities proportional to grievance, but are inhibited by the risk of being arrested-which is determined by the ratio of coercive agents to probable rebels in the local area. We explore the effect of similarity perception on the dynamics of collective behavior. If workers are surrounded by more in-group members, they are more risk-taking; if surrounded by more out-group members, more risk-averse. Individual interest and group membership jointly affect patterns of workers protest: rhythm, frequency, strength, and duration of protest outbreaks. Results indicate that when wages are more unequally distributed, the previous outburst tends to suppress the next one, protests occur more frequently, and they become more intensive and persistent. Group identification does not seriously influence the frequency of local uprisings. Both their strength and duration, however, are negatively affected by the ingroup-outgroup assessment. The overall findings are valid when workers distinguish 'us' from 'them' through simple binary categorization, as well as when they perceive degrees of similarity and difference from their neighbors. },

@article{landesberger11_visual_analy_large_graph_30,
 abstract     = {The analysis of large graphs plays a prominent role in various fields of research and is relevant in many important application areas. Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand, and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques cover techniques that had been introduced until 2000 or concentrate only on graph layouts published until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as time-varying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graph-structured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this State-of-the-Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review firstly considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process. We also present main open research challenges in this field.},

@inproceedings{lehmann11_366,
 abstract     = {In species subject to individual and social learning, each individual is likely to express a certain number of different cultural traits acquired during its lifetime. If the process of trait innovation and transmission reaches a steady state in the population, the number of different cultural traits carried by an individual converges to some stationary distribution. We call this the trait-number distribution. In this paper, we derive the trait-number distributions for both individuals and populations when cultural traits are independent of each other. Our results suggest that as the number of cultural traits becomes large, the trait-number distributions approach Poisson distributions so that their means characterize cultural diversity in the population. We then analyse how the mean trait number varies at both the individual and population levels as a function of various demographic features, such as population size and subdivision, and social learning rules, such as conformism and anti-conformism. Diversity at the individual and population levels, as well as at the level of cultural homogeneity within groups, depends critically on the details of population demography and the individual and social learning rules.},

@article{lindemann11_bdsm_as_therap_14,
 abstract     = {While I was conducting field research on professional dominatrices ('pro-dommes'), an unexpected discourse emerged: respondents repeatedly characterized themselves as 'therapists', speaking about their work as a form of psychological treatment for their clients. This article examines the way they speak about BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism) as therapeutic. Data are derived from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 66 female pro-dommes. The rhetoric used by participants in this form of commercial eroticism 'on the ground' has implications for feminist theoretical claims about the potential value of classifying erotic labor as 'sex therapy' as well as resonance with other socially stigmatized erotic practices.},

@book{liu11_grey_system_,
 abstract     = {This book systematically presents the fundamental theory, methods, and techniques of practical application of grey systems theory. It stands for the crystallization of the authors' many years of theoretical exploration, real-life application, and teaching. It absorbs most of the recent theoretical and applied advances of the theory achieved by scholars from across the world so that it vividly presents the reader with the overall picture of this new theory and its frontal research activities. This book contains 10 chapters, including Introduction to Grey Systems Theory, Basic Building Blocks of Grey Systems Theory, Grey Relationships, Grey Systems Modeling, Discrete Grey Prediction Models, Combined Grey Models, Grey Models for Decision Making, Grey Game Models, Grey Control, and others. It includes a computer software package developed for grey systems modeling. The contents, such as the axiomatic system of buffer operators and a series of weakening and strengthening operators, the axioms for measuring the greyness of grey numbers, the general grey incidences (grey absolute incidence, grey relative incidence, grey comprehensive incidence, grey analogy incidence, grey nearness incidence), discrete grey models, fixed weight grey cluster evaluation and grey evaluation methods based on triangular whitenization weight functions, multiattribute intelligent grey target decision models, the applicable range of the G(1,1) model, grey econometric models (G-E), grey Cobb-Douglass model (G-C-D), grey input-output model (G-I-O), grey Markov models (G-M), grey game models (GG), etc., are introduced by the authors the first time. This book will be appropriate as a reference and/or textbook for graduate students or high level undergraduate students, majoring in areas of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, astronomy, earth science, economics, and management. It can also be utilized as a reference book by researchers and technicians in research institutions, business entities, and government agencies.},

@inproceedings{mcguinness11_incor_requir_struc_into_tiles_,
 abstract     = {Search based procedural content generation uses search techniques to locate high-quality content elements for use in games. This study extends an evolutionary-computation based system to generate tiles used to assemble floor plans for levels in a video game as well as evolving assembly plans. The separate evolution of assembly plans and tiles yields a decomposition of the level generation problem that saves substantial time. The tiles used in this study use a more sophisticated fitness function than earlier studies and also permit the user to specify features, e.g. rooms of a particular shape or short or long transit distances between two points in the tile. Evolutionary computation is used as an off-line tool to generate libraries of both tiles and assembly plans. Systems for rapidly assembling tile libraries can then be used to generate large levels on demand with combinatorially huge numbers of level plans available. The new fitness function can be used to control the topology of the tiles and optionally permits the incorporation of enforced symmetry in tiles. Symmetric tiles are found to have a visually striking appearance. Control is achieved by requesting that different pairwise distances between user-specified checkpoints be minimized, maximized, or left free. This study explores the new fitness functions and demonstrates the variety of tiles that can be generated as well as assembling exemplary level plans from those tiles.},

 abstract     = {We consider the artist-programmer, who creates work through its description as source code. The artist-programmer grandstands computer language, giving unique vantage over human-computer interaction in a creative context. We focus on the human in this relationship, noting that humans use an amalgam of language and gesture to express themselves. Accordingly we expose the deep relationship between computer languages and continuous expression, examining how these realms may support one another, and how the artist-programmer may fully engage with both. Our argument takes us up through layers of representation, starting with symbols, then words, language and notation, to consider the role that these representations may play in human creativity. We form a cross-disciplinary perspective from psychology, computer science, linguistics, human-computer interaction, computational creativity, music technology and the arts. We develop and demonstrate the potential of this view to inform arts practice, through the practical introduction of software prototypes, artworks, programming languages and improvised performances. In particular, we introduce works which demonstrate the role of perception in symbolic semantics, embed the representation of time in programming language, include visuospatial arrangement in syntax, and embed the activity of programming in the improvisation and experience of art.},

 abstract     = {By 2013, more than 800 million people worldwide will use GPS enabled devices. These devices are quickly making the concept of &#x201C;collective intelligence&#x201D; a reality - even more than the Internet - by enabling everyday experiences in the context of time and location. The wisdom of the crowd will benefit consumers through services that get better the more people use them. In his keynote, Dr. Tero Ojanper? will address the influence of Collective Intelligence today and in the future of mobile services. He will reflect on the opportunities for the industry and society, as well as the responsibilities for those offering mobile services.},

 abstract     = {Most powerful analytical tools used in the social sciences are well suited for studying static situations. Static and mechanistic analysis, however, is not adequate to understand the changing world in which we live. In order to adequately address the most pressing social and environmental challenges looming ahead, we need to develop analytical tools for analyzing dynamic situations - particularly institutional change. In this paper, we develop an analytical tool to study institutional change, more specifically, the evolution of rules and norms.We believe that in order for such an analytical tool to be useful to develop a general theory of institutional change, it needs to enable the analyst to concisely record the processes of change in multiple specific settings so that lessons from such settings can eventually be integrated into a more general predictive theory of change.},

 abstract     = {This work describes a computational model designed for emotional contagion simulation in societies of agents, integrating the influence of interpersonal relationships and personality. It models the fundamental differences in individual susceptibilities to contagion based on the psychology study of Emotional Contagion Scale. The contagion process can also be biased by inter-individual relationships depending on the intimacy and power difference aspects of relationships between agents. Individuals' expressiveness in a group is influenced by both the extroversion personality trait and power difference. Additionally, the computational model includes the process of mood decay, as usually observed in people, expanding its application domain beyond that of pure simulation, like games. In this paper we present simulation results that verify the basic emotional contagion behaviors. The possibility of more complex contagion dynamics depending on agent group relationships is also presented. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

First, this letter analyzes the unique properties of multicast video delivery, which is vulnerable to malicious video flooding attacks. Second, the effectiveness of the observation of bandwidth provisioning efficiency in the detection of anomalous patterns of multicast flooding is discussed and a traffic-sharing density-based flooding detection (TDFD) mechanism is proposed. Numerical analysis and simulation results are given to validate the performance of the TDFD. © 2010 IEEE.},

Eleven transgender people of color (6 African American, 3 Latino/a, 2 Multiracial) participated in semistructured interviews (60-90 minutes each) exploring their expression of resilience in response to traumatic life events. Findings included six major themes common among all participants: (a) pride in one's gender and ethnic/racial identity, (b) recognizing and negotiating gender and racial/ethnic oppression, (c) navigating relationships with family, (d) accessing health care and financial resources, (e) connecting with an activist transgender community of color, and (f) cultivating spirituality and hope for the future. Specific clinical and advocacy implications for trauma work with this group are provided.},

The domain we focus on is characterized by real-time move-ment through a continuous space in which the player and opposing boss damage each other through phys-ical collisions, and player and boss behavior is gov-erned primarily by finite state machines. Our program-ming model consists of primitive systems such as kine-matic physics to store object state and detect collisions paired with finite state machines to define behavior. We describe our model and demonstrate its expressiveness with examples of three classic boss fights from games in The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, and Sonic the Hedge-hog. Our future goals include procedural generation of boss encounters, and we report on the research chal-lenges involved in achieving this goal.},

@article{skanland11_use_mp3_as_copin_resour_3,
 abstract     = {A crucial aspect of maintaining good mental health is to cope successfully with everyday stressors. This article explores the MP3 player as a technology of coping related to the stress of everyday life, in particular two common stressors in the urban environment: crowding and noise. The MP3 player has become a prime medium for everyday music listening, as individuals can carry a vast amount of music with them wherever they go. This unprecedented availability of music raises questions about its impact on the listener, or, as I will refer to him/her, the music user. In order to better understand the effects of this use, this article asks: how are mobile music devices used as a coping resource or device? The research presented here is based on twelve interviews with regular users of MP3 players who live or work in an urban environment. In fusing research on portable music players with research on stress and coping, this article suggests that the MP3 player may be a valuable coping device, enabling music users to enhance their subjective well-being and mental health.},

@inproceedings{smith11_inclus_view_player_model_,
 abstract     = {"Player modeling" is a loose concept. It can equally apply to everything from a predictive model of player actions resulting from machine learning to a designer's description of a player's expected reactions in response to some piece of game content. This lack of a precise terminology prevents practitioners from quickly finding introductions to applicable modeling methods or determining viable alternatives to their own techniques. We introduce a vocabulary that distinguishes between the major existing player modeling applications and techniques. Four facets together define the kind for a model: the scope of application, the purpose of use, the domain of modeled details, and the source of a model's derivation or motivation. This vocabulary allows the identification of relevant player modeling methods for particular problems and clarifies the roles that a player model can take.},

This Virtual Cultural Laboratory (VCL) is developed using agent-based modeling technology. Individuals' tendencies and preferences as well as the behavior of cultural objects in the transformation of cultural information are taken into consideration. In addition, the effect of local interactions at different scales over time and space is visualized through the VCL interface. Information repositories, cultural items, borders, population size, individual' tendencies and other features are determined by the user. Finally, the researcher can also isolate specific factors whose effect on the global system might be of interest to the researcher. All the code can be found at http://projects.cultureplex.ca/},

 abstract     = {Agency, being one's ability to perform an action and have some influence over the world, is fundamental to interactive entertainment. Although much of the games industry is concerned with providing more agency to its players, what seems to matter more is how much agency each player will actually perceive. In this paper, we present a computational model of this phenomena, based on the notion that the amount of agency that one perceives depends on how much they desire the outcomes that result from their decisions. Using a structure for high-agency stories that we designed specifically for this intent, we present the results of a 141-participant user study that tests our model's ability to select subsequent events in an original interactive story. Using a newly validated survey instrument for measuring both agency and fun, we found with a high degree of confidence that event sequences selected by our model result in players perceiving more agency than players who experience event sequences that our model does not recommend.},

Af- ter drawing up some clear demarcations for what is and what is not PCG, we present two versions of a content genera- tion system for InfiniteMario Bros which is intentionally de- signed to question these same demarcations. We argue that, according to our own definition, one version of the system is an example of PCG while the other is not, even though they are mostly identical. We hope that this paper answers some questions but raises others, and inspires researchers and de- velopers to thread some less common ground in developing content generation techniques.},

On the basis of these examples we discuss some of the implications of this inter-enactive approach to agency for our understanding of social phenomena in a broader sense, and how the interenactive account provided here has to be taken alongside a theory of largerscale social processes.},

 abstract     = {Newsgames and artgames, two genres in which designers wish to communicate messages to players, often deploy procedural representation. Understanding these proceduralist games requires special attention to a game's processes as well as how these interact with its theme and aesthetics. In this paper we present a method for proceduralist readings of arcade-like 2D games so that players can determine their range of intended and unintended meanings, critics can assess the strengths and weaknesses of the presented arguments, and designers can identify ways to refine their rhetorical strategies. Through identifying the components of games that can be interpreted and emphasizing where cultural considerations influence interpretations, we present a framework for meaning derivations that strive to take the entirety of a game into consideration. As demonstrated by several examples, this framework requires much more explicit and formal arguments for why a game carries a meaning and precisely where each component of one's argument came from.},

In this paper, we distinguish between two enforcing mechanisms. i.e. punishment and sanction, focusing on the specificways in which they favor the emergence and maintenance of cooperation. The key research question is to find more stable and cheaper mechanisms for norm compliance in hybrid social environments (populated by humans and computational agents). To achieve this task, we have developed a normative agent able to punish and sanction defectors and to dynamically choose the right amount of punishment and sanction to impose on them (Dynamic Adaptation Heuristic). The results obtained through agent-based simulation show us that sanction is more effective and less costly than punishment in the achievement and maintenance of cooperation and it makes the population more resilient to sudden changes than if it were enforced only by mere punishment.},

In this paper we compare two kinds of models of character style: one based on models derived from the Big Five theory personality, and the other derived from a corpus-based method applied to characters and films from the IMSDb archive. We apply these models to character utterances for a pilot narrative-based outdoor augmented reality game called Murder in the Arboretum. We use an objective quantitative metric to estimate the quality of a character model, with the aim of predicting model quality without perceptual experiments. We show that corpus-based character models derived from individual characters are often more detailed and specific than personality based models, but that there is a strong correlation between personality judgments of original character dialogue and personality judgments of utterances generated for Murder in the Arboretum that use the derived character models.},

@book{webb11_statis_patter_recog_,
 abstract     = {Statistical pattern recognition relates to the use of statistical techniques for analysing data measurements in order to extract information and make justified decisions. It is a very active area of study and research, which has seen many advances in recent years. Applications such as data mining, web searching, multimedia data retrieval, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, all require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. This third edition provides an introduction to statistical pattern theory and techniques, with material drawn from a wide range of fields, including the areas of engineering, statistics, computer science and the social sciences. The book has been updated to cover new methods and applications, and includes a wide range of techniques such as Bayesian methods, neural networks, support vector machines, feature selection and feature reduction techniques.Technical descriptions and motivations are provided, and the techniques are illustrated using real examples.},

@article{whitty11_what_i_wont_do_pixel_27,
 abstract     = {This paper examined the emotional impact that engaging in or witnessing Symbolic Taboo Activities (STAs), as represented in MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing game), such as killing, torture and rape, has on adults. We focused our study on two games: World of Warcraft and Sociolotron. The study employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), which was chosen because of its emphasis on 'lived experienced' and how participants make sense of their experiences. Five participants, all over the age of 18 years, were interviewed via Instant Messenger, four of which were men. Most of our participants felt they could easily separate gamespace from the real world; however, when asked to examine specific actions in-depth, we found this was not the case for all STAs. Activities that did not have a sanctioned equivalence (e.g., rape) were found by most to be more difficult to separate, especially emotionally. However, this was not the case for all participants. The findings suggest that not all individuals can psychologically cope with engaging in and/or witnessing certain STAs in MMORPGs. The results, we believe are important for game designers, censoring bodies of video games and psychologists. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
