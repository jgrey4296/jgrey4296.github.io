 abstract     = {Photography of the Wall in Palestine is a site of visual and political struggle. Through conversations with Palestinian and Israeli photographers, I shed light on the visual and national anxiety that photography of the Palestinian land- scape produces in the shadow of the Wall's construction. Building on Gil Hochberg's conceptualization of visual poli- tics, through which the Israeli state dominates the visual field, I argue that the significance of Israeli photographers' work lies in visualizing what is made invisible by the state. For Palestinians, the significance of their photography of the landscape lies in resisting the visual politics dictated by the Israeli regime. I conclude by offering questions about the role of photography in subverting visual politics in Palestine and Israel.},

Agent-based simulation is a powerful tool for decision-makers to explore different strategies for managing such crisis, testing them on a simulated population; but valid results require realistic underlying models. It is therefore essential to be able to compare models using different architectures to represent the human behaviour, on ob-jective and subjective criteria. In this paper we describe two simulations of the Australian population's behaviour in bushfires: one with a finite-state machine architecture; one with a BDI architecture. We then compare these two models with respect to a number of criteria.},

However, without clearly-defined objectives, they often leave players without a sense of purpose. Most of the time, quests and objectives are hand-authored and overlaid atop an open world's mechanics. But what if they could be generated organically from the gameplay itself? The goal of our project was to develop a model of the mechanics in Minecraft that could be used to determine the ideal placement of objectives in an open world setting. We formalized the game logic of Minecraft in terms of logical rules that can be manipulated in two ways: they may be executed to generate graphs representative of the player experience when playing an open world game with little developer direction; and they may be statically analyzed to determine dependency orderings, feedback loops, and bottlenecks. These analyses may then be used to place achievements on gameplay actions algorithmically.},

 abstract     = {Given a tower of interpreters, i.e., a sequence of multiple interpreters interpreting one another as input programs, we aim to collapse this tower into a compiler that removes all interpretive overhead and runs in a single pass. In the real world, a use case might be Python code executed by an x86 runtime, on a CPU emulated in a JavaScript VM, running on an ARM CPU. Collapsing such a tower can not only exponentially improve runtime performance, but also enable the use of base-language tools for interpreted programs, e.g., for analysis and verification. In this paper, we lay the foundations in an idealized but realistic setting. We present a multi-level lambda calculus that features staging constructs and stage polymorphism: based on runtime parameters, an evaluator either executes source code [thereby acting as an interpreter] or generates code [thereby acting as a compiler]. We identify stage polymorphism, a programming model from the domain of high-performance program generators, as the key mechanism to make such interpreters compose in a collapsible way. We present Pink, a meta-circular Lisp-like evaluator on top of this calculus, and demonstrate that we can collapse arbitrarily many levels of self-interpretation, including levels with semantic modifications. We discuss several examples: compiling regular expressions through an interpreter to base code, building program transformers from modi ed interpreters, and others. We develop these ideas further to include reflection and reification, culminating in Purple, a reflective language inspired by Brown, Blond, and Black, which realizes a conceptually infinite tower, where every aspect of the semantics can change dynamically. Addressing an open challenge, we show how user programs can be compiled and recompiled under user-modified semantics.},

As a result, a fairly general programming scheme can be defined in order to specify, compose and render both spatial media objects (e.g. 3D drawings) and timed media objects (e.g. Animation or Mu-sic). Each of these constructs is specified in Haskell via an adequate type class definition and an associated uniform data type construct. A simple monoid based semantics model of the turtle command language of Logo is detailed and extended throughout the paper. This allows for providing step by step introductions and usage examples of the algebraic concepts and constructs our proposal is based on.},

Through attention to the ways that they are rendered doubly liminal and intersectionally impacted as a result of the prevalence of both anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, police violence as well as faith-based profiling and surveillance, I examine the fusion of spirituality and protest that informs the worship and activism of my interlocutors, the crafting of protest repertoires that draw upon the legacies of African American freedom struggles and Islamic mandates to social justice for the purposes of resisting, reimagining, and reshaping the marginalization that they experience.},

In this paper, we study whether and how much public safety improvements are capitalized by the housing market after an exogenous shock to the gentrification process. We use variation induced by the sudden end of rent control in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1995 to examine within-Cambridge variation in reported crime across neighborhoods with different rent-control levels, abstracting from the prevailing city-wide decline in criminal activity. Using detailed location-specific incident-level criminal activity data assembled from Cambridge Police Department archives for the years 1992 through 2005, we find robust evidence that rent decontrol caused overall crime to fall by 16 percent-approximately 1,200 reported crimes annually-with the majority of the effect accruing through reduced property crime. By applying external estimates of criminal victimization's economic costs, we calculate that the crime reduction due to rent deregulation generated approximately \$10 million (in 2008 dollars) of annual direct benefit to potential victims. Capitalizing this benefit into property values, this crime reduction accounts for 15 percent of the contemporaneous growth in the Cambridge residential property values that is attributable to rent decontrol. Our findings establish that reductions in crime are an important part of gentrification and generate substantial economic value. They also show that standard cost-of-crime estimates are within the bounds imposed by the aggregate price appreciation due to rent decontrol.},

Using the information collected from those records, we estimate a structural gravity model of long-distance trade in the Bronze Age. We find a distance elasticity for ancient trade close to modern estimates. We also use our structural gravity model to locate lost ancient cities. In many instances, our structural estimates confirm the conjecture of historians who followed a radically different method. In some instances, our estimates confirm one conjecture against others. Finally, using historical data on political centers, as well as modern data on regional trade and incomes, we document persistent patterns in cities' prominence across four millennia even after controlling for time-invariant geographic attributes such as agricultural suit-ability, mineral resources and defensive ability. Discussing related quantitative and qualitative evidence from historical geography, we argue that the locational advantage brought by natural transport routes dictated by topography is a key factor in explaining the persistence of city size distributions.},

For practitioners, a short term perspective uses the state of the art to define a three layered functional architecture for autonomous driv-ing, consisting of a vehicle platform, a cognitive driving intelligence, and off-board supervisory and monitoring services. The architecture is placed within a broader context of model based systems engineering (MBSE), for which we define four classes of models: Concept of Operations, Logical Architecture, Application Software Components, and Platform Components. These classes aid an immediate or subsequent MBSE methodology for concrete projects. Also for concrete projects, we propose an implementation setup and tech-nologies that combine simulation and implementation for rapid testing of au-tonomous driving functionality in physical and virtual environments. Future evolution of autonomous driving systems is explored with a long term per-spective looking at stronger concepts of autonomy like machine consciousness and self-awareness. Contrasting these concepts with current engineering prac-tices shows that scaling to more complex systems may require incorporating elements of so-called constructivist architectures. The impact of autonomy on systems engineering is expected to be mainly around testing and verification, while implementations shall continue experiencing an influx of technologies from non-automotive domains.},

Exploiting exogenous variations in world prices, we find a positive impact of mining on conflict at the local level. Quantitatively, our estimates suggest that the historical rise in mineral prices (commodity super-cycle) might explain up to one-fourth of the average level of violence across African countries over the period. We then document how a fighting group's control of a mining area contributes to escalation from local to global violence. Finally, we analyze the impact of corporate practices and transparency initiatives in the mining industry. (JEL C23, D74, L70, O13, Q34) Natural riches such as valuable minerals have often been blamed for fueling armed fighting. A case that recently made headlines is the heavy fighting that broke out between the Rizeigat and Bani Hussein, two Arab tribes, for territorial control of the Jebel Amer gold mine in Darfur region. The conflict has killed more than},

We also randomized \$200 grants. Cash alone and therapy alone initially reduced crime and violence, but effects dissipated over time.

 abstract     = {This article addresses contemporary concerns about critique through an interpretation of the ``writing prophets.'' This approach draws on Foucauldian genealogy and suggests that alongside Greek parrhesia, Old Testament prophecy is a key forerunner of contemporary critical discourses. Our analysis draws upon Weber's interpretative historical sociology and Gadamerian hermeneutics but shifts the emphasis from charisma to critique, through a direct engagement with prophetic texts. In particular, prophetic discourse claims to reveal injustice and idolatry and speaks from a position of transcendence within immanent historical moments. Prophets position their own era as a moment of crisis, and themselves as liminal figures, opposed to the delusion of others and ''false prophets'' which resonates with contemporary conceptions of ''ideology.'' Rather than focusing on historical individuals, we approach prophecy as a discourse, multiple and hybrid, discontinuous, and contradictory, yet constituting a distinctive precursor which informs contemporary critique. {\textcopyright}2017, {\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2017.},

 abstract     = {Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of fingerprint recognition systems to dictionary attacks based on MasterPrints. MasterPrints are real or synthetic fingerprints that can fortuitously match with a large number of fingerprints thereby undermining the security afforded by fingerprint systems. Previous work by Roy et al. generated synthetic MasterPrints at the feature-level. In this work we generate complete image-level MasterPrints known as DeepMasterPrints, whose attack accuracy is found to be much superior than that of previous methods. The proposed method, referred to as Latent Variable Evolution, is based on training a Generative Adversarial Network on a set of real fingerprint images. Stochastic search in the form of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy is then used to search for latent input variables to the generator network that can maximize the number of impostor matches as assessed by a fingerprint recognizer. Experiments convey the efficacy of the proposed method in generating DeepMasterPrints. The underlying method is likely to have broad applications in fingerprint security as well as fingerprint synthesis.},

In a storytelling context where the intent is to convey multiple narrative points, a richer set of timeline designs may be more appropriate than the narrow range that has been used for exploratory data analysis by the research community. Informed by a survey of 263 timelines, we present a design space for storytelling with timelines that balances expressiveness and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices characterized by three dimensions: representation, scale, and layout. Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories. Ultimately, this work is intended to inform and inspire the design of future tools for storytelling with timelines},

 abstract     = {Police violence against racial and ethnic minorities has been researched through the lens of multiple social science disciplines including psychology. Within psychology, the study of trauma lends itself to understanding the dynamics of unjustified violence perpetrated by some law enforcement agents. These acts of aggression are not only examples of interpersonal trauma but also the trauma of racism, which is examined through the lens of intergenerational trauma, racist incident-based trauma, and complex trauma. There is a history of violence against racial and ethnic minorities that contextualizes the traumatic experience of police violence. Additionally, the framework of trauma illuminates the causes and consequences of police brutality as a racist incident trauma. Finally, survivors of police violence targeting racial and ethnic minorities are often persons who have been exposed to multiple traumas resulting in a cumulative effect. Filling a current gap in the literature, we discuss the clinical implications of applying trauma theories to police violence, as well as diverse ways racially and ethnically marginalized persons have coped with and resisted these acts. There is attention given to the need to attend to the intersecting identities of persons who are targeted such as ethnic minority women. Finally, we describe the need for further study of this complex and devastating phenomenon.},

Extensive research has been carried out in centralised planning for single-agent systems, but so far decentralised multi-agent planning has not been fully explored. In this paper, we extend existing multi-agent platforms to enable decentralised planning at runtime. In particular, we put forward a planning and execution framework called Decentralised Online Multi-Agent Planning (DOMAP). Experiments with a planning domain we developed on flooding disaster scenarios show that DOMAP outperforms 4 other state-of-the-art multi-agent planners, particularly in the most difficult problems.},

Although several AOP frameworks exist for more renowned languages such as Java and C\#, little to no frameworks have been developed for actor oriented languages such as Erlang. We thus present eAOP, a new AOP framework specifically designed to instrument actororiented constructs in Erlang such as message sends and receives, along with other traditional constructs such as function calls.},

Our model builds upon three concepts from the Annales-mentalities, levels of time, and critical events-to explore how critical events affect different dimensions of institutional logics and exert short- or long-range influences. On these bases, organizations make choices, from decoupling to radical shifts in logics, leading to severe institutional changes that become the matter of history. As much as organizations are influenced by events and the prevalent institutional logics, their choices trigger macro-level changes in a recursive manner. More broadly, we comment on how fruitful is our approach to historicize organization studies.},

In this paper, we analyze how the BT representation increases the modularity of an HDS and how key system properties are preserved over compositions of such systems, in terms of combining two BTs into a larger one. We also show how BTs can be seen as a generalization of sequential behavior compositions, the subsumption architecture, and decisions trees. These three tools are powerful but quite different, and the fact that they are unified in a natural way in BTs might be a reason for their popularity in the gaming community. We conclude the paper by giving a set of examples illustrating how the proposed analysis tools can be applied to robot control BTs.},

This text shows how many up-to techniques can be framed as size-preserving functions, using sized types to keep track of sizes. Through a number of examples it is argued that this approach to up-to techniques is often convenient to use in practice. Some examples of functions that cannot be made size-preserving are also included, in order to illustrate the limits of the approach. On the more theoretical side a class of up-to techniques intended to capture a natural mode of use of size-preserving functions is defined. This class turns out to correspond closely to `` functions below the companion '' , a notion recently introduced by Pous.},

Our results can be applied to a variety of systems of two superconducting qubits coupled to resonators.},

Applications in such domains often depend on reflection over knowledge, including what an agent knows about what other agents know. We are interested in enabling formal specification of these systems which may be used for executable prototyping as well as verification and other formal reasoning. Dynamic Epistemic Logic provides a formal basis for such reasoning, but is often prohibitively cumbersome to use in practice. We present an implementation and macro system called Ostari, backed by a particular flavor of Dynamic Epistemic Logic, which allows us to scale the ideas to more realistic problems. We demonstrate how actions that manipulate agents' beliefs can be written concisely and how this capability can be applied to modeling a popular card game by utilizing our system's ability to execute action sequences, answer queries about knowledge states, and find action sequences to satisfy a particular goal.},

One thing that it can mean- and in the Palestinian case of nearly seventy years of displacement, what it necessarily has meant for many people-is to die as a refugee. This essay explores the conse- quences of the ways in which humanitarian work has been compelled to take up the end of life as a humanitarian concern. Drawing on fieldwork in the Burj al Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, it explores care for the aging and dying as a setting in which key aspects of the social world produced through humanitarianism are brought into existence and view. The problems of the end of life introduce ad- ditional challenges into the conundrums of long-term humanitarianism, occurring at the intersection of humanitarian practice and Palestinian experience. With the ques- tions of services for the aging and dying foregrounded, the possibility of the future becomes a site of confrontation among, and within, providers and recipients. Often, this future appears to be foreclosed.},

 abstract     = {Long-listed for the National Book AwardOne of The New York Times Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2017Short-listed for the Inaugural Goddard Riverside Stephan Russo Book Prize for Social JusticeIn recent years, America's criminal justice system has become the subject of an increasingly urgent debate. Critics have assailed the rise of mass incarceration, emphasizing its disproportionate impact on people of color. As James Forman, Jr., points out, however, the war on crime that began in the 1970s was supported by many African American leaders in the nation's urban centers. In Locking Up Our Own, he seeks to understand why. Forman shows us that the first substantial cohort of black mayors, judges, and police chiefs took office amid a surge in crime and drug addiction. Many prominent black officials, including Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry and federal prosecutor Eric Holder, feared that the gains of the civil rights movement were being undermined by lawlessness1em1ptand thus embraced tough-on-crime measures, including longer sentences and aggressive police tactics. In the face of skyrocketing murder rates and the proliferation of open-air drug markets, they believed they had no choice. But the policies they adopted would have devastating consequences for residents of poor black neighborhoods.A former D.C. public defender, Forman tells riveting stories of politicians, community activists, police officers, defendants, and crime victims. He writes with compassion about individuals trapped in terrible dilemmas1em1ptfrom the men and women he represented in court to officials struggling to respond to a public safety emergency. Locking Up Our Own enriches our understanding of why our society became so punitive and offers important lessons to anyone concerned about the future of race and the criminal justice system in this country.},

 abstract     = {The prevalence of several human morbid phenotypes is sometimes much higher than intuitively expected. This can directly arise from the presence of two sexes, male and female, in one species. Men and women have almost identical genomes but are distinctly dimorphic, with dissimilar disease susceptibilities. Sexually dimorphic traits mainly result from differential expression of genes present in both sexes. Such genes can be subject to different, and even opposing, selection constraints in the two sexes. This can impact human evolution by differential selection on mutations with dissimilar effects on the two sexes. We comprehensively mapped human sex-differential genetic architecture across 53 tissues. Analyzing available RNA-sequencing data from 544 adults revealed thousands of genes differentially expressed in the reproductive tracts and tissues common to both sexes. Sex-differential genes are related to various biological systems, and suggest new insights into the pathophysiology of diverse human diseases. We also identified a significant association between sex-specific gene transcription and reduced selection efficiency and accumulation of deleterious mutations, which might affect the prevalence of different traits and diseases. Interestingly, many of the sex-specific genes that also undergo reduced selection efficiency are essential for successful reproduction in men or women. This seeming paradox might partially explain the high incidence of human infertility. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the sex-differential transcriptome and its importance to human evolution and human physiology in health and in disease.},

 abstract     = {In postwar America, not everyone wanted to move out of the city and into the suburbs. For decades before World War II, New York's tenants had organized to secure renters' rights. After the war, tenant activists raised the stakes by challenging the newly-dominant ideal of homeownership in racially segregated suburbs. They insisted that renters as well as owners had rights to stable, well-maintained homes, and they proposed that racially diverse urban communities held a right to remain in place--a right that outweighed owners' rights to raise rents, redevelop properties, or exclude tenants of color. Further, the activists asserted that women could participate fully in the political arenas where these matters were decided. Grounded in archival research and oral history, When Tenants Claimed the City: The Struggle for Citizenship in New York City Housing shows that New York City's tenant movement made a significant claim to citizenship rights that came to accrue, both ideologically and legally, to homeownership in postwar America. Roberta Gold emphasizes the centrality of housing to the racial and class reorganization of the city after the war; the prominent role of women within the tenant movement; and their fostering of a concept of ``community rights'' grounded in their experience of living together in heterogeneous urban neighborhoods.},

By lodging an asylum claim, migrants enter into a system that will, in effect, produce them as legitimate refugees deserving of protection or as illegitimate, ``bogus'' asylum seekers in need of expulsion. In this way, asylum claimants inhabit a dual positionality of citizen-in-waiting/deportee-in-waiting, as they often spend many years waiting for the adjudication of their cases. This article ethnographically analyzes how this dual positionality is inhabited by asylum claimants, producing novel forms of suffering and being-in-the-world. More specifically, I argue that the asylum process evokes a sense of ''existential limbo'': a subjective and temporal state of being in which the asylum system, in the present moment, is understood as the locus of suffering and in which life and meaning making are defined by a sense of immobility.},

We explored the genetic architecture of the trait using data from over 52,000 male participants of UK Biobank, aged 40-69 years. We identified over 250 independent genetic loci associated with severe hair loss (P5x10-8). By splitting the cohort into a discovery sample of 40,000 and target sample of 12,000, we developed a prediction algorithm based entirely on common genetic variants that discriminated (AUC = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.74, specificity = 0.69, PPV = 59 },

Although there are many reasons to suspect that these laws could harm groups like racial minorities and the poor, existing studies have been limited, with most occurring before states enacted strict identification requirements, and they have uncovered few effects. By using validated voting data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study for several recent elections, we are able to offer a more definitive test. The analysis shows that strict identification laws have a differentially negative impact on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries and general elections. We also find that voter ID laws skew democracy toward those on the political right.},

It includes white nationalists and disillusioned right-wing dissidents who draw from theories like neoreaction, a political theory that is contemptuous of modernism, democracy, and egalitarianism, and favors a form of ''nondemocratic system with rule-driven succession.''ii As an online movement, it also has firm links with participatory media networks through websites such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit, along with meme and troll culture.iii The alt-right capitalized on the anti- immigration and anti-establishment campaign themes of Donald Trump to thrust its ideas into the political mainstream. Just as Trump made use of social media, the alt-right utilized memes-and like Trump, the movement attracted attention and visibility through provocations and sensationalism.},

Yet, they still face an important challenge, that of long-term structure, which is key to conveying a sense of musical coherence. We present the MorpheuS music generation system designed to tackle this problem. MorpheuS \& \#x0027; novel framework has the ability to generate polyphonic pieces with a given tension profile and long- and short-term repeated pattern structures. A mathematical model for tonal tension quantifies the tension profile and state-of-the-art pattern detection algorithms extract repeated patterns in a template piece. An efficient optimization metaheuristic, variable neighborhood search, generates music by assigning pitches that best fit the prescribed tension profile to the template rhythm while hard constraining long-term structure through the detected patterns. This ability to generate affective music with specific tension profile and long-term structure is particularly useful in a game or film music context. Music generated by the MorpheuS system has been performed live in concerts.},

These approaches focus on the decision-making process, and largely neglect the operationalization of norms. This omission leads to an analytical gap: a lack of attention to how the substance of abstract norms is transformed and constructed in the operationalization process. This article draws on the Foucauldian theme of governmentality to introduce a novel perspective on operationalizing norms. It focusses in particular on the role of techniques as understudied parts inherent to the reflexive processes of operationalization and meaning production. The article thereby contests the prevalence of fundamental norms in conventional IR theory. It demonstrates, instead, that global governance techniques do not simply translate rationalities into practice, but construct their very own normativities. These theoretical reflections are illustrated by analysing the operationalization of norms through indicators in the case of the European Union's human rights policy./p},

Refinement types distinguish different values of datatypes; if a program annotated with refinements passes type checking, pattern-matching failures become impossible. Unfortunately, refinement is a monolithic property of a type, exacerbating the difficulty of adding refinement types to nontrivial programs. Gradual typing has explored how to incrementally move between static typing and dynamic typing. We develop a type system of gradual sums that combines refinement with imprecision. Then, we develop a bidirectional version of the type system, which rules out excessive imprecision, and give a type-directed translation to a target language with explicit casts. We prove that the static sublanguage cannot have match failures, that a well-typed program remains well-typed if its type annotations are made less precise, and that making annotations less precise causes target programs to fail later. Several of these results correspond to criteria for gradual typing given by Siek et al. (2015).},

 abstract     = {Responding to the paucity of institutional literature which meaningfully distinguishes between emotional displays and the experience of emotions, I describe the process by which display rules are codified into the logics governing an institutional regime. I then theorize the role of feigning behaviors, or emotional displays which are decoupled from the physiological experience of emotion either in intensity or valence (positive/negative), in the higher-order dynamics of institutional logics. Specifically, I suggest that the two categories of feigning behavior (valence congruous feigning and diametric feigning) can play different roles in catalyzing the coexistence, blending, and contestation of logics. This research aids institutional theorists in understanding the local affairs and 'on-the-ground' lived experiences of logics through highlighting the role of feigned emotional display as the ubiquitous mechanism through which persons navigate and cope with institutional mandates.

Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to the intricate spatial infrastructures that give jurisdiction its form. In this article, I argue that the complex architectures that undergird various jurisdictional registers combine to segment material and virtual landscapes into historically specific, multilayered geographies of discretion, dictating where, when, and to whom various institutions are permitted to speak the law. Looking to politicized litigation and advocacy over the rights of Haitian asylum seekers in the United States, I demonstrate how battles over jurisdictional cartographies can both instantiate and remake the spatiality of nation-states and the cosmologies of liberal sovereignty on which they rest.},

An organisation's modus operandi is enacting and fulfilling contracts between itself and its participants. Yet, organisational contracts should respect external laws, such as those setting out data privacy rights and liberties. Contracts can only be enacted by following contract law processes, which often require bilateral agreement and consideration. Governments need to legislate whilst understanding today's context of national and international governance hierarchy where law makers shun isolationism and seek to influence one another. Governments should avoid punishment by respecting constraints from international treaties and human rights charters. Governments can only enact legislation by following their own, pre-existing, law making procedures. In other words, institutions, such as laws and contracts are designed and enacted under constraints.},

Machine-learning algorithms often have tests baked in, but they can't account for human errors in coding. Rather than blindly rely on machine-learning results as many researchers have, you can mitigate the risk of errors with TDD and write clean, stable machine-learning code. If you're familiar with Ruby 2.1, you're ready to start. {\textbullet}Apply TDD to write and run tests before you start coding {\textbullet}Learn the best uses and tradeoffs of eight machine learning algorithms {\textbullet}Use real-world examples to test each algorithm through engaging, hands-on exercises {\textbullet}Understand the similarities between TDD and the scientific method for validating solutions {\textbullet}Be aware of the risks of machine learning, such as underfitting and overfitting data {\textbullet}Explore techniques for improving your machine-learning models or data extraction},

It is assumed that you already know the basics of programming, but previous background on competitive programming is not needed. The book is especially intended for students who want to learn algorithms and possibly participate in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) or in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Of course, the book is also suitable for anybody else interested in competitive programming. It takes a long time to become a good competitive programmer, but it is also an opportunity to learn a lot. You can be sure that you will get a good general understanding of algorithms if you spend time reading the book, solving problems and taking part in contests. The book is under continuous development. You can always send feedback on the book to ahslaaks@cs.helsinki.fi.},

One of those components should be the complexity of information processing producing the knowing aspect of consciousness. The author introduces an approach to this aspect in the form of conceptual systems theory ( CST), a neo-Piagetian model of cognitive development, which has been used to good effect to explain information processing in social situations but heretofore neglected by anthropologists. The neuroanthropological underpinnings of CST are discussed, as is the range of potential applications to ethnological and ethnographic problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

 abstract     = {Extending the success of deep neural networks to natural language understanding and symbolic reasoning requires complex operations and external memory. Recent neural program induction approaches have attempted to address this problem, but are typically limited to differentiable memory, and consequently cannot scale beyond small synthetic tasks. In this work, we propose the Manager-Programmer-Computer framework, which integrates neural networks with non-differentiable memory to support abstract, scalable and precise operations through a friendly neural computer interface. Specifically, we introduce a Neural Symbolic Machine, which contains a sequence-to-sequence neural ``programmer'', and a non-differentiable ''computer'' that is a Lisp interpreter with code assist. To successfully apply REINFORCE for training, we augment it with approximate gold programs found by an iterative maximum likelihood training process. NSM is able to learn a semantic parser from weak supervision over a large knowledge base. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WebQuestionsSP, a challenging semantic parsing dataset, with weak supervision. Compared to previous approaches, NSM is end-to-end, therefore does not rely on feature engineering or domain specific knowledge.},

However, the costs that institutions can impose are limited, so that their commitment capacity is weak. Institutions can also impose costs as a condition of membership, allowing them to serve as costly signals. A model of weak commitment and costly signaling leads to a number of hypotheses about patterns of cooperation, institutional membership, and states' preferences over institutional design. For example, existing members of an institution should impose higher ante/italiccosts when a potential new member could either gain significant benefits from reneging on their commitments in the future, and when the new member expects to gain high benefits from future cooperation. These results are consistent with empirical work on institutions including peacekeeping and the World Trade Organization. /p},

This analysis contributes to anthropological literature on the state, and shows that state formation and state functions may take place outside of governmental institutions. The case of the Cerro de Oro hydroelectric plant project in Oaxaca, Mexico, reveals how rights are ignored by state officials and subordinated to powerful economic interests in a new phase of capitalist expansion. The main hypothesis here is that the neoliberal state generates a situation of tense contradictions by simultaneously trying to guarantee the economic interests of transnational enterprises and the rights of indigenous people. Within this contradiction, the Mexican government abandons the exercise of sovereignty, generating disputes among private enterprises and local communities as they attempt to assume the functions of state, or state-ness. {\textcopyright}2017 by the American Anthropological Association},

Examining two recent cases of what are defined as ``toxic technocultures'' (\#Gamergate and The Fappening), this work describes how Reddit's design, algorithm, and platform politics implicitly support these kinds of cultures. In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit's karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered. This research is informed by the results of a long-term participant-observation and ethnographic study into Reddit's culture and community and is grounded in actor-network theory.},

 abstract     = {Traditional saliency models usually adopt hand-crafted image features and human-designed mechanisms to calculate local or global contrast. In this paper, we propose a novel computational saliency model, i.e., deep spatial contextual long-term recurrent convolutional network (DSCLRCN) to predict where people looks in natural scenes. DSCLRCN first automatically learns saliency related local features on each image location in parallel. Then, in contrast with most other deep network based saliency models which infer saliency in local contexts, DSCLRCN can mimic the cortical lateral inhibition mechanisms in human visual system to incorporate global contexts to assess the saliency of each image location by leveraging the deep spatial long short-term memory (DSLSTM) model. Moreover, we also integrate scene context modulation in DSLSTM for saliency inference, leading to a novel deep spatial contextual LSTM (DSCLSTM) model. The whole network can be trained end-to-end and works efficiently when testing. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that DSCLRCN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on saliency detection. Furthermore, the proposed DSCLSTM model can significantly boost the saliency detection performance by incorporating both global spatial interconnections and scene context modulation, which may uncover novel inspirations for studies on them in computational saliency models.},

However, for agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical patterns is insufficient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a defined vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of non-verbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable.},

But prior studies cast doubt on whether police commanders can control officers, and offer few policy remedies because of their focus on potentially immutable officer traits like personality. I advance an alternative, institutional perspective and demonstrate that police officers-sometimes characterized as autonomous-are highly responsive to managerial directives. Using millions of records of police-citizen interactions alongside officer interviews, I evaluate the impact of a change to the protocol for stopping criminal suspects on police performance. An interrupted time series analysis shows the directive produced an immediate increase in the rate of stops producing evidence of the suspected crime. Interviewed officers said the order signaled increased managerial scrutiny, leading them to adopt more conservative tactics. Procedural changes can quickly and dramatically alter officer behavior, suggesting a reform strategy sometimes forestalled by psychological and personality-driven accounts of police reform.},

We find that program evaluation randomized controlled trials published in top journals over the last 15 years have typically been '' small '' in these senses, but also identify a number of examples - including from our own work - demonstrating that experimentation at much larger scales is both feasible and valuable.},

While rules certainly channel and constrain behavior, and in principle require some actions and prohibit others, deviations from these requirements and prohibitions do occur. In addition, rules may be '' interpreted, '' and the rules, themselves, do change - what humans devise they may revise. With all this conceptual movement, are the rules of the game too wobbly a foundation for the study of institutions? Note to Ostrom Workshop Colloquium Series readers: This is, indeed, a '' work in progress, '' inasmuch as potential blind alleys and false starts, as well as only the earliest version of a potential way forward, are in evidence in the present draft. The topic, moreover, is somewhat more abstract and foundational than is your normal fare. While I would welcome technical reactions and constructive advice, I am especially interested in the practical matter about how to wrap one's mind around '' the rules of the game. ''},

Ontogenetic approaches (i.e., that try to mimic the desired result, instead of generating it by simulating natural processes) are usually the best fit for most applications, usually involving altering a base character and/or combining sets of modular parts. This is, however, still a design, art and engineering challenge. This chapter covers procedural character generation, while pointing at character design fundamentals that should be kept in mind when designing these systems. Starting by reviewing state-of-the-art techniques from games that have them as a main feature, it then covers mesh generation, altering existing meshes and scaling bones to generate diverse silhouettes. It also proposes a technique for 3D mesh combi- nation that involves offline tagging of vertices in edges to create seamless joints between modules at runtime. Finally, it covers texture generation and combining texture channels in ways that allow even more varied characters.},

In June 2016 the United Kingdom decided to leave the EU invoking article 50 of the treaty. But is withdrawal democratically legitimate? In fact, the all-affected principle suggests that it is undemocratic for subunits to leave larger political units when it adversely affects other citizens without including them in the decision. However, it is unclear what the currency of this affectedness is and, hence, why withdrawal would be undemocratic. We argue that it is the effect of withdrawal on the status of citizens as free and equal that is decisive and that explains why unilateral withdrawal of subunits from larger units is democratically illegitimate. Moreover, on the 'all-affected status principle' that we develop, even multilaterally agreed withdrawal is undemocratic because the latter diminishes the future ability of citizens to make decisions together regarding issues that affect their status as free and equal. On this basis, we conclude that it is undemocratic for a member state such as the United Kingdom to withdraw from the EU./p},

We find no evidence that this slowdown is due to trade dynamics, Italy's inefficient governmental apparatus, or excessively protective labor regulations. By contrast, the data suggest that Italy's slowdown was more likely caused by the failure of its firms to take full advantage of the ICT revolution. While many institutional features can account for this failure, a prominent one is the lack of meritocracy in the selection and rewarding of managers. Familyism and cronyism are the ultimate causes of the Italian disease.},

This coupling can impose drawbacks such as arbitrary limitations to the aspect language. LARA is a DSL for source-to-source transformations inspired by AOP concepts, and has been designed to be independent of the target language. In this paper we propose techniques to overcome some of the challenges presented by a language-independent approach to source code transformations, and present and discuss possible solutions and their impact. Additionally, we present some of the benefits and opportunities of this approach. We present an evaluation of our approach, show that we can significantly reduce the effort to develop weavers for new target languages and that the proposed techniques contribute to more concise LARA aspects and safer semantics.},

 abstract     = {How might heteronormativity be reproduced and become internalized through biomedical practices? Based on in-depth, person-centered interviews, this paper explores the ways heteronormativity works into medical education through the hidden curriculum. As experienced by my informants, case studies often reinforce unconscious heteronormative orientations and heterosexist/homophobic stereotypes about queer patients among straight and queer medical students alike. I introduce the concept of the irrelevance narrative to make sense of how queer medical students take up a heteronormative medical gaze. Despite recognizing that being queer affects how they interact with patients, my informants describe being queer as irrelevant to their delivery of care. I conclude with a discussion of how these preliminary findings can inform research on knowledge production in biomedical education and practice with an eye toward the tensions between personal and professional identity among biomedical practitioners.

 abstract     = {The term ``post-factual politics'' (or ``post-truth politics'), which Wikipedia usefully defines as ``a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion disconnected from the details of policy, and by the repeated assertion of talking points to which factual rebuttals are ignored,'' has been widely employed in relation to Britain's EU referendum and the 2016 US presidential election. At issue here are not just particular lies, like the 350 million per week Leave campaigners in the UK falsely claimed went to the EU, but the whole spirit in which the debates were conducted. Warnings of negative economic consequences of a pro-Brexit vote were routinely dismissed as '' Project Fear '' -the implication being that is was unpatriotic even to question Britain's ability to prosper outside the EU. A will-ingness to ignore facts came close to being presented as a moral virtue. Michael Gove encapsulated this spirit in his claim that '' people in this country have had enough of experts '' -a remarkable statement to come from a former Sec-retary of State for Education. 1 On the other side of the Atlantic Donald Trump's contempt for facts scarcely needs documenting, but those interested might consult the Toronto Star's list of 560 falsehoods he uttered during the cam-paign on every conceivable topic from youth unemployment rates among African-Americans to the numbers of Syrian refugees admitted to the USA by the Obama administration. 2 On Trump's first day in office White House press sec-retary Sean Spicer berated the press for understating the size of the crowds at the inauguration, insisting that this was '' the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. '' 3 When challenged with evidence that clearly showed the contrary, presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway described Spicer's falsehoods as '' alternative facts. '' 4 Such abuses of truth by the powerful do not augur well for the future of democracy, which depends on an informed electorate. My concern here, however, is not primarily with Westminster and the White House. It is with the extent to which left- wing analysis of the Brexit and Trump victories has become clouded by the same post-factual fog. Perception of these victories as '' upsets '' or '' shocks '' is arguably itself a symptom of a political culture in which feeling and belief count for more than evidence or argument. No rational observer should have been surprised by these outcomes. In the British case, though most polls published during the last week of the campaign predicted a slender win for Remain, over the previous three weeks 17 out of 26 polls had predicted a Leave victory. 5 In the US, where most polls had shown a majority for Clinton for months, the gap sharply narrowed in the week before the election, leaving her with a bare 3.1 },

 abstract     = {This paper describes the METACOMPOSE music generator, a compositional, extensible framework for affective music composition. In this context 'affective' refers to the music generator's ability to express emotional information. The main purpose of METACOMPOSE is to create music in real-time that can express different mood-states, which we achieve through a unique combination of a graph traversal-based chord sequence generator, a search-based melody generator, a pattern-based accompaniment generator, and a theory for mood expression. Melody generation uses a novel evolutionary technique combining FI-2POP with multi-objective optimization. This allows us to explore a Pareto front of diverse solutions that are creatively equivalent under the terms of a multi-criteria objective function. Two quantitative user studies were performed to evaluate the system: one focusing on the music generation technique, and the other that explores valence expression, via the introduction of dissonances. The results of these studies demonstrate (i) that each part of the generation system improves the perceived quality of the music produced, and (ii) how valence expression via dissonance produces the perceived affective state. This system, which can reliably generate affect-expressive music, can sub-sequently be integrated in any kind of interactive application (e.g., games) to create an adaptive and dynamic soundtrack.},

We estimate that ex- prisoners comprise 2.2 percent of the U.S. voting age population and 10.4 percent of the African American male voting age population; ex-felons comprise 6.4 percent of the voting age population and 25.4 percent of the African American male voting age population. We then discuss the far-reaching consequences of the spatial concentration and enormous growth of these groups since 1980.},

 abstract     = {The article is concerned with the latest developments in Indonesia's Islamic field. Its focus is on the role of social media in exchange relationships between Islamic preachers and their constituency. The article first discusses economic exchanges between preachers and their followers, and then it concentrates on social exchanges and how they are mediated today. Empirically, the article delivers insight into the concerns of mostly female Indonesian middle-class Muslims and shows how preachers have to adjust to the needs of their followers who are regularly online. Theoretically, the article offers a rereading of Pierre Bourdieu's classic work on forms of capital and their conversion. It emphasizes the temporal dimension of capital accumulation and conversion and explores the temporalities of online exchanges that have become constitutive of preacher-follower relationships. In doing so, it shows how Indonesia's Islamic preacher economy is currently transformed by these online exchanges, resulting in preacher-follower relationships that are characterized by dialogic constructions of Islamic authority. Being part of Indonesia's Islamic field, these changes in the Islamic preacher economy point to a broader trend in Indonesia's Islamic field toward greater sensitivity to the needs and worries of Indonesian middle-class Muslims.},

Hence, there is a need for providing people who are not professional developers with the flexibility to pose relatively complex and ad hoc queries in an easy and intuitive way. In this respect, visual methods for query formulation undertake the challenge of making querying independent of users' technical skills and the knowledge of the underlying textual query language and the structure of data. An ontology is more promising than the logical schema of the underlying data for guiding users in formulating queries, since it provides a richer vocabulary closer to the users' understanding. However, on the one hand, today the most of world's enterprise data reside in relational databases rather than triple stores, and on the other, visual query formulation has become more compelling due to ever-increasing data size and complexity-known as Big Data. This article presents and argues for ontology-based visual query formulation for end-users; discusses its feasibility in terms of ontology-based data access, which virtualises legacy relational databases as RDF, and the dimensions of Big Data; presents key conceptual aspects and dimensions, challenges, and requirements; and reviews, categorises, and discusses notable approaches and systems.},

Using a case study conducted in Tatarstan, which included interviews with criminal gang members and representatives of law enforcement agencies and analysis of secondary data, it argues that instead of a pattern of elimination or subjugation of Russian organized crime by the state, we see a mutually reinforcing ensemble which reproduces the existing social order. While both the strengthening of the state and organized crime actors' own ambitions led to their increasing integration into political structures, a complex web of interdependencies emerged in which actors from criminal networks and political authorities collaborated using each other's resources. This fusion and assimilation of members of the governing bureaucracy and members of an aspiring bourgeoisie coming from criminal backgrounds were as much the result of consensus and cooperation as of competition and confrontation.},

The automatic anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies assay offered great advantages over traditional methods in terms of improved precision, reliability, technical simplicity, short turnaround time and high-speed throughput. In this study, we evaluated the main technical performance and diagnostic accuracy of the first automatic anti-CCP assay approved in China. Methods. The study comprised 106 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 203 non-RA rheumatic disease controls and 46 healthy persons. Anti-CCP, rheumatoid factor (RF),   1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were measured and compared. The precision, reference intervals for Chinese population and cut-off value for RA diagnosis, as well as the suitable diluent for anti-CCP were assessed. The positive rate and score of anti-CCP were compared with RF and acute-phase reactants, according to the new RA criteria. Results. Within- and between-run imprecision, expressed as the coefficient of variation, were 0.47-1.36 },

Qualitative findings construct a semiotic triangle in which: (i) Child rape and wealth reflect upon witchcraft by highlighting its accumulative rather than distributive nature; (ii) Child rape and witchcraft cast aspersions on power, including liberal governance and (iii) Rape is a metaphysical theft of power, a perspective that converges with some feminist analyses. Understanding this discourse can lead to better research on sexual violence in conflict-affected countries.},

 journal      = {Ssrn},
 tags         = {biophysics,buddhism,dysfunction,economics,large_scale,religion,socio_economic},
 abstract     = {Buddhist economics embodies a world view that is very different from the world views of Western economies. The world views of the latter are largely based on the tenets of mainstream economics. The world view of every society reflects its citizens' values, especially their values concerning how their economies should function. The functioning of all economies needs to be built on an explicit set of values related to the society's economic goals. The world views associated with Western or modern capitalist economies are typically narrowly oriented and emphasize growth of output. The world view of Buddhist economics, on the other hand, emphasizes a very broad view of what contributes to well-being. The latter world view emphasizes the ideal relationships that humans can develop with each other and with nature. This paper analyzes and outlines why a society adopting Buddhist economics can be expected to experience much less socio-economic and biophysical dysfunction than can be expected for conventionally oriented capitalist societies. Human activities are increasingly having massive negative consequences for both the biosphere and socio-economic relationships. Climate change is a prominent example of biophysical dysfunction, and obesity is an important example of socio-economic dysfunction. The world view and orientation of mainstream economics does little to help us understand the causes of these large dysfunctions, nor to understand what is necessary to resolve them. Mainstream economics does not provide the key insights into the socio-economic causes of the market failures involved. For example, it provides little appreciation of the tendency of businesses to be excessively self-interested, opportunistic, and exploitive in its relationships with consumers and others. The idea that businesses might embrace social responsibility and attempt to serve people's true preferences rather their actual preferences is foreign to mainstream economics. Mainstream economics also does not help us understand the excessive growth of the Earth's economic activity and the excessive use of fossil fuel energy. Further, it does not help us understand that consumers' ignorance and inability to find satisfaction with their consumption are principal factors in contemporary biophysical dysfunction. Because important, large scale dysfunctions such as climate change and obesity have been largely outside the scope of mainstream economics, the types of analysis most suitable for understanding them have not been developed. It follows that mainstream economists are unlikely to propose viable solutions for these dysfunctions. Interestingly, it turns out that many of the answers can be found by turning to the wisdom embodied in Buddhism. As Thich Nhat Hanh has stated, what is needed is a collective enlightenment. We need to draw on Buddhist teachings such as the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. These teachings can help us understand why dishonest businesses that are not concerned with the true well-being of their customers are part of the problem. It will also help us understand that ignorant, compulsive consumer behavior is an integral part of the dysfunctions. Ideally, people ought to consume mindfully and moderately, using intelligent reflection on their choices in order for their consumption to contribute to their true well-being. If a society were to adopt Buddhist economics, and if people and businesses were to behave in accord with the ideals articulated in Buddhist teachings, there is good reason to believe that the result would be sustainable use of the Earth's resources and that both biophysical and socio-economic dysfunctions would be avoided or resolved. Clearly, we need Buddhist economics.},

 abstract     = {Recently proposed techniques have finally made it possible for analysts to interactively explore very large datasets in real time. However powerful, the class of analyses these systems enable is somewhat limited: specifically, one can only quickly obtain plots such as histograms and heatmaps. In this paper, we contribute Gaussian Cubes, which significantly improves on state-of-the-art systems by providing interactive modeling capabilities, which include but are not limited to linear least squares and principal components analysis (PCA). The fundamental insight in Gaussian Cubes is that instead of precomputing counts of many data subsets (as state-of-the-art systems do), Gaussian Cubes precomputes the best multivariate Gaussian for the respective data subsets. As an example, Gaussian Cubes can fit hundreds of models over millions of data points in well under a second, enabling novel types of visual exploration of such large datasets. We present three case studies that highlight the visualization and analysis capabilities in Gaussian Cubes, using earthquake safety simulations, astronomical catalogs, and transportation statistics. The dataset sizes range around one hundred million elements and 5 to 10 dimensions. We present extensive performance results, a discussion of the limitations in Gaussian Cubes, and future research directions.},

 abstract     = {The 2001 Institute of Medicine report entitled Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care pointed out extensive healthcare disparities in the United States even when controlling for disease severity, socioeconomic status, education, and access. The literature identifies several groups of Americans who receive disparate healthcare: ethnic minorities, women, children, the elderly, the handicapped, the poor, prisoners, lesbians, gays, and the transgender population. Disparate healthcare represents an enormous current challenge with substantial moral, ethical, political, public health, public policy, and economic implications, all of which are likely to worsen over the next several decades without immediate and comprehensive action. A review of recent literature reveals over 100 general and specific suggestions and solutions to eliminate healthcare disparities. While healthcare disparities have roots in multiple sources, racial stereotypes and biases remain a major contributing factor and are prototypical of biases based on age, physical handicap, socioeconomic status, religion, sexual orientation or other differences. Given that such disparities have a strong basis in racial biases, and that the principles of racism are similar to those of other ``isms'', we summarize the current state of healthcare disparities, the goals of their eradication, and the various potential solutions from a conceptual model of racism affecting patients (internalized racism), caregivers (personally mediated racism), and society (institutionalized racism).},
