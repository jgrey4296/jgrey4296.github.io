 abstract     = {The purpose of this work is to introduce and experimentally validate a framework, based on statistical machine learning, for handling a broad range of problems in information retrieval (IR). Probably the most important single component of this framework is a parametric statistical model of word relatedness. A longstanding problem in IR has been to develop a mathematically principled model for document processing which acknowledges that one sequence of words may be closely related to another even if the pair have few (or no) words in common. The fact that a document contains the word automobile, for example, suggests that it may be relevant to the queries Where can I find information on motor vehicles? and Tell me about car transmissions, even though the word automobile itself appears nowhere in these queries. Also, a document containing the words plumbing, caulk, paint, gutters might best be summarized as common house repairs, even if none of the three words in this candidate summary ever appeared in the document.},

@article{brewka01_dynam_argum_system,
 abstract     = {We present a formal model of argumentation based on situation calculus which captures both the logical and the procedural aspects of argumentation processes. The logic is used to determine what is accepted by each agent participating in the discussion and by the group as a whole, on the basis of the speech acts performed during argumentation. Argumentation protocols, also called rules of order, describe declaratively which speech acts are legal in a particular state of the argumentation. We first discuss argumentation with fixed rules of order. Our model tolerates protocol violations but makes it possible to object to illegal actions. In realistic settings the rules of order themselves can at any time become the topic of the debate. We show how meta‚Äêlevel argumentation of this kind can be modelled in what we call dynamic argument systems. To illustrate the notions introduced in the paper we present a reconstruction of Rescher's theory of formal disputation and a dynamic argument system with three levels which we use to discuss a murder case.},

If more convincing evidence cannot be obtained, one solution might be to modify the current terminology.

@article{byrne01_act_r_menu_selec,
 abstract     = {Understanding the interaction of a user with a designed device such as a GUI requires clear understanding of three components: the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities of the user, the task to be accomplished and the artefact used to accomplish the task. Computational modeling systems which enable serious consideration of all these constraints have only recently begun to emerge. One such system is ACT-R/PM, which is described in detail. ACT-R/PM is a production system architecture that has been augmented with a set of perceptual-motor modules designed to enable the detailed modeling of interactive tasks. Nilsen's (1991) random menu selection task serves two goals: to illustrate the promise of this system and to help further our understanding of the processes underlying menu selection and visual search. Nilsen's original study, two earlier models of the task, and recent eye-tracking data are all considered. Drawing from the best properties of the previous models considered and guided by information from the eye-tracking experiment, a series of new models of random menu selection were constructed using ACT-R/PM. The final model provides a zero-parameter fit to the data that does an excellent, though not perfect, job of capturing the data. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.},

@article{castelfranchi01_social_trust,
 abstract     = {After arguing about the crucial importance of trust for Agents and MAS, we provide a definition of trust both as a mental state and as a social attitude and relation. We present the mental ingredients of trust: its specific beliefs and goals, with special attention to evaluations and expectations. We show the relation between trust and the mental background of delegation. We explain why trust is a bet, and implies some risks, and analyse the more complex forms of social trust, based on a theory of mind and in particular on morality, reputation and disposition, and authority (three party trust). We explain why promises, contracts, authorities can increase our trust by modifying our mental representations. We present a principled quantification of trust, based on its cognitive ingredients, and use this "degree of trust" as the basis for a rational decision to delegate or not to another agent. We explain when trust is rational, and why it is not an irrational decision by definition. We also criticise the economic and game-theoretic view of trust for underestimating the importance of cognitive ingredients of trust and for reducing it to subjective probability and risk. The paper is intended to contribute both to the conceptual analysis and to the practical use of trust in social theory and MAS.},

These are here defined as deliberative agents, representing norms and deciding upon them. Normative agents can use the norms to evaluate others' behaviours and, possibly, convince them to comply with norms. Normative agents contribute to the social dynamics of norms, and more specifically, of norm-based social control and influence. In fact, normative intelligence allows agents to Check the efficacy of the norms (the extent to which a norm is applied in the system in which it is in force), and possibly Urge their fellows to obey the norms. The following issues are addressed: What is norm-based control? Why and how do agents exercise control on one another? What role does it play in the spread of norms? },

Test scores representing seven distinct cognitive abilities were examined in relation to user performance. Results indicate that, when using VIRIs, visual-perceptual abilities account for significant amounts of within-subjects variance, particularly when the relevance criteria were highly specific. Visualisation ability also seemed to be a critical factor when users were required to change topical perspective within the visualisation. Suggestions are made for navigational cues that may help to reduce the effects of these individual differences.},

First, different levels of narrative intelligence are discussed in the context of human and robotic story-tellers. Then, we introduce a computational framework which is based on minimal definitions of stories, story-telling and autobiographic agents. An experimental test-bed is described which is used for the study of story-telling, using robotic agents as examples of situated, autonomous minimal agents. Experimental data is provided which support the working hypothesis that story-telling can be advantageous, i.e. increases the survival, of an autonomous, autobiographic, minimal agent. We conclude this paper by discussing implications of this approach for narrative and learning environments.},

@article{dignum01_model_agent_societ,
 abstract     = {Organisations can be defined as a set of entities regulated by mechanisms of social order and created by more or less autonomous actors to achieve common goals. Multi-agent systems are a natural choice to design organisational systems due to the proactive and autonomous behaviour of agents. However, in business environments it is necessary to consider the behaviour of the global system and the collective aspects of the domain. In this paper, we argue that multi-agent systems should be designed around organisational co-ordination frameworks that reflect the co-ordination structures of the particular organisation. As in human societies, we argue that norms and institutions are a way for agent societies to cope with the challenge of social order. Through institutions, conventions and interaction patterns for the co-ordination of agents can be specified, monitored and managed.},

@article{flentge01_model_emerg_posses_norms_using_memes,
 abstract     = {In this paper we study the emergence and the effects of a possession norm in an artificial society. We link the study of norms and the concept of memes as put forward by Richard Dawkins. Normative behaviour is modelled using memes as carriers for certain behaviours. For our simulations we extend the sugarscape model from Epstein and Axtell (1996) and give the agents the possibility to claim possession of a "plot" of land. Memes regulate the behaviour of the agents regarding the land claims of others. It turns out that the probability for the survival of the population is much higher when possession claims of others are respected. However, there exist short term disadvantages for agents respecting the possessions of others. Thus, the need for a possession norm arises. The introduction of sanctions provides a good possibility to enforce the norm as long as no costs arise for sanctioning agents. We also investigate different kinds of meme propagation and their effects on the establishment of the norm. },

@book{grosz01_archit_outsid,
 abstract     = {To be outside allows one a fresh perspective on the inside. In these essays, philosopher Elizabeth Grosz explores the ways in which two disciplines that are fundamentally outside each anotherarchitecture and philosophycan meet in a third space to interact free of their internal constraints. "Outside" also refers to those whose voices are not usually heard in architectural discourse but who inhabit its spacethe destitute, the homeless, the sick, and the dying, as well as women and minorities.Grosz asks how we can understand space differently in order to structure and inhabit our living arrangements accordingly. Two themes run throughout the book: temporal flow and sexual specificity. Grosz argues that time, change, and emergence, traditionally viewed as outside the concerns of space, must become more integral to the processes of design and construction. She also argues against architectures historical indifference to sexual specificity, asking what the existence of (at least) two sexes has to do with how we understand and experience space. Drawing on the work of such philosophers as Henri Bergson, Roger Caillois, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, and Jacques Lacan, Grosz raises abstract but nonformalistic questions about space, inhabitation, and building. All of the essays propose philosophical experiments to render space and building more mobile and dynamic.},

@article{grudin01_desit_action,
 abstract     = {Many psychological studies have shown that when we act, and especially when we interact, we consciously and unconsciously attend to context of many types. Sensors can pick up some but not all context that is acquired through our senses. Some context is lost, some is added, and captured context is presented in new ways. Digital aggregators and interpreters do not aggregate and interpret the same way we do. Missing or altered context disrupts our processing of information in ways that we may not recognize. To address the disruption we may use additional sensors to capture and deliver some of the missing context. Learning to handle these new conduits is then a further source of disruption, and on it can go. With greater knowledge of context, we can work and interact more efficiently, assuming that we can learn to take advantage of the information without being overwhelmed. However, converting contextual information to a digital format changes it in specific ways. Transient information becomes more permanent, local information is made available globally, and information that once spread slowly can spread much more quickly. The information can enable us to work more efficiently, but these changes in its nature have profound indirect effects. The potential loss of privacy is widely discussed, but other effects may be more significant. In particular, the loss of confinement and transience of information creates an environment that is fundamentally unnatural, in conflict with the one we evolved to live in.},

The results indicated that the GRE and UGPA are generalizably valid predictors of graduate grade point average, Ist-year graduate grade point average, comprehensive examination scores, publication citation counts, and faculty ratings. GRE correlations with degree attainment and research productivity were consistently positive; however, some lower 90 % credibility intervals included 0.

@article{leijen01_parsec,
 abstract     = {Despite the long list of publications on parser combinators, there does not yet exist a monadic parser combinator library that is applicable in real world situations. In particular naive implementations of parser combinators are likely to suffer from space leaks and are often unable to report precise error messages in case of parse errors. The Parsec parser combinator library described in this paper, utilizes a novel implementation technique for space and time efficient parser combinators that in case of a parse error, report both the position of the error as well as all grammar productions that would have been legal at that point in the input.},

@book{lessig01_futur_of_ideas,
 abstract     = {The Internet revolution has come. Some say it has gone. What was responsible for its birth? Who is responsible for its demise? In The Future of Ideas, Lawrence Lessig explains how the Internet revolution has produced a counterrevolution of devastating power and effect. The explosion of innovation we have seen in the environment of the Internet was not conjured from some new, previously unimagined technological magic; instead, it came from an ideal as old as the nation. Creativity flourished there because the Internet protected an innovation commons. The Internets very design built a neutral platform upon which the widest range of creators could experiment. The legal architecture surrounding it protected this free space so that culture and informationthe ideas of our eracould flow freely and inspire an unprecedented breadth of expression. But this structural design is changingboth legally and technically. This shift will destroy the opportunities for creativity and innovation that the Internet originally engendered. The cultural dinosaurs of our recent past are moving to quickly remake cyberspace so that they can better protect their interests against the future. Powerful conglomerates are swiftly using both law and technology to "tame" the Internet, transforming it from an open forum for ideas into nothing more than cable television on speed. Innovation, once again, will be directed from the top down, increasingly controlled by owners of the networks, holders of the largest patent portfolios, and, most invidiously, hoarders of copyrights. The choice Lawrence Lessig presents is not between progress and the status quo. It is between progress and a new Dark Ages, in which our capacity to create is confined by an architecture of control and a society more perfectly monitored and filtered than any before in history. Important avenues of thought and free expression will increasingly be closed off. The door to a future of ideas is being shut just as technology makes an extraordinary future possible. With an uncanny blend of knowledge, insight, and eloquence, Lawrence Lessig has written a profoundly important guide to the care and feeding of innovation in a connected world. Whether it proves to be a road map or an elegy is up to us.},

@inproceedings{parish01_proced_model_cities,
 abstract     = {Modeling a city poses a number of problems to computer graphics. Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

 abstract     = {This paper deals with the behavior of virtual environments from the collaboration point-of-view, in which actors (human or virtual beings) interact and collaborate by means of interdependent tasks. In this sense, actors may realize tasks that are dependent on tasks performed by other actors, while the interdependencies between tasks (through resource management and temporal relations) delineate the overall behavior of a virtual environment. Our main goal is to propose an approach for the coordination of those behaviors. Initially a generic study of possible interdependencies between collaborative tasks is presented, followed by the formal modeling (using Petri Nets) of coordination mechanisms for those dependencies. In order to implement such mechanisms, an architecture of reusable and pluggable coordination components is also introduced. These components are used in an implementation of a multi-user videogame. The presented approach is a concrete step to create virtual societies of actors that collaborate to reach common goals without the risk of getting involved in conflicting or repetitive tasks. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

 abstract     = {It is now generally recognised that emotions play an important functional role within both individuals and societies, thereby forming an important bond between these two levels of analysis. In particular, there is a bi-directional interrelationship between social norms and emotions, with emotions playing an instrumental role for the sustenance of social norms and social norms being an essential element of regulation in the individual emotional system. This paper lays the foundations for a computational study of this interrelationship, drawing upon the functional appraisal theory of emotions. We describe a first implementation of a situated agent architecture, TABASCOJAM, that incorporates a simple appraisal mechanism and report on its evaluation in a well-known scenario for the study of aggression control as a function of a norm, that was suitably extended. The simulation results reported in the original aggression control study were successfully reproduced, and consistent performances were achieved for extended scenarios with conditional norm obeyance. In conclusion, it is argued that the present effort indicates a promising lane towards the necessary abandonment of logical models for the explanation and simulation of human social behaviour. },

In general, there has been a great deal of consistency across studies within the eye-movement literature, and researchers have discovered and examined many variables involved in the reading process that affect the nature of readers' eye movements. Despite remarkable progress, however, there are still a number of issues to be resolved. In this article, we discuss three controversial issues: (1) the extent to which eye-movement behavior is affected by low-level oculomotor factors versus higher-level cognitive processes; (2) how much information is extracted from the right of fixation; and (3) whether readers process information from more than one word at a time.},

Protege is a general-purpose tool that allows domain experts to build knowledge-based systems by creating and modifying reusable ontologies and problem-solving methods, and by instantiating ontologies to construct knowledge bases. The SHriMP (Simple Hierarchical Multi-Perspective) visualization technique was designed to enhance how people browse, explore and interact with complex information spaces. Although SHriMP is information independent, its primary use to date has been for visualizing and documenting software programs. The paper describes how we have applied software visualization techniques to more general knowledge domains. It is hoped that the integrated environment (called Jambalaya) will result in an easier to use and more powerful environment to support ontology evolution and knowledge acquisition. An example scenario of how Jambalaya can be applied to knowledge acquisition is provided.},

@inproceedings{wang01_brain,
 abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The cerebral mechanisms underlying the behaviours that lead to pathological overeating and obesity are poorly understood. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that modulates rewarding properties of food, is likely to be involved. To test the hypothesis that obese individuals have abnormalities in brain dopamine activity we measured the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in brain. METHODS: Brain dopamine D2 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a radioligand for the dopamine D2 receptor). Bmax/Kd (ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum minus 1) was used as a measure of dopamine D2 receptor availability. Brain glucose metabolism was also assessed with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). FINDINGS: Striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the ten obese individuals (2.47 [SD 0.36]) than in controls (2.99 [0.41]; p \textless or = 0.0075). In the obese individuals body mass index (BMI) correlated negatively with the measures of D2 receptors (r=0.84; p \textless or = 0.002); the individuals with the lowest D2 values had the largest BMI. By contrast, neither whole brain nor striatal metabolism differed between obese individuals and controls, indicating that striatal reductions in D2 receptors were not due to a systematic reduction in radiotracer delivery. INTERPRETATION: The availability of dopamine D2 receptor was decreased in obese individuals in proportion to their BMI. Dopamine modulates motivation and reward circuits and hence dopamine deficiency in obese individuals may perpetuate pathological eating as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. Strategies aimed at improving dopamine function may be beneficial in the treatment of obese individuals.},

 abstract     = {The Liquid Narrative research group at North Carolina State University, a multidisciplinary group of faculty and students seeking to create interactive narrative environments. To do this, we are designing and building intelligent systems capable of creating structured interaction within virtual worlds that achieves the same kind of cognitive and affective responses to interactive stories as that seen in the participants of conventional narrative media such as the film or the novel. Our approach exploits a well-founded, declarative model of action and intention (Young, Pollack and Moore 1994, Young, Moore and Pollack, 1994) applied to virtual world contexts, in combination with new computational models of narrative structure. The intended result is the production of engaging, story-based interactive applications for education, training and entertainment.},
