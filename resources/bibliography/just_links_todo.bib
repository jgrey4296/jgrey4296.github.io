Extensive research has been carried out in centralised planning for single-agent systems, but so far decentralised multi-agent planning has not been fully explored. In this paper, we extend existing multi-agent platforms to enable decentralised planning at runtime. In particular, we put forward a planning and execution framework called Decentralised Online Multi-Agent Planning (DOMAP). Experiments with a planning domain we developed on flooding disaster scenarios show that DOMAP outperforms 4 other state-of-the-art multi-agent planners, particularly in the most difficult problems.},

These platforms typically provide various mechanisms for runtime coordination, which are often useful in online planning. In this context decentralised multi-agent planning can be efficient as well as effective, especially in loosely-coupled domains, whilst also ensuring important properties in agent systems such as privacy and autonomy. In this paper, we describe the DOMAP planning framework and its integration with a multi-agent programming platform to support the achievement of social goals. Our planning framework has separate phases for goal allocation and individual HTN planning, whilst relying on available runtime coordination.

The recent focus on hypermedia-driven APIs together with initiatives such as the Web of Things and Linked Data are now promoting and advancing the development of a new generation of dynamic, open, and long-lived systems on the Web. These systems require agent-based solutions to the point that Web researchers have started to build autonomous systems on their own. It is thus both timely and necessary to investigate and align the latest developments in Web research and multi-agent systems (MAS) research. We argue that the answer lies equally in a lack of practical use cases as well as the premature development and alignment of Web and agent technologies. We then present our vision for a new generation of autonomous systems on the Web, which we call hypermedia MAS, together with the research opportunities and challenges they bring.},

  abstract  = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) have long been envisioned as a key enabling technology in manufacturing, but this promise is yet to be realized: the lack of proper models, architectures, tooling, and the high level of expertise required for designing and programming agent-based manufacturing systems have hindered their large-scale acceptance. The emerging Web of Things (WoT), now being standardized at the W3C and IETF, provides new research opportunities that could help MAS enter the mainstream. In this paper, we present an approach to design scalable and flexible agent-based manufacturing systems that integrates automated planning with multi-agent oriented programming for the WoT: autonomous agents synthesize production plans using semantic descriptions of Web-based artifacts and coordinate with one another via multi-agent organizations; engineers can program and repurpose the systems on the fly via an intuitive Web user interface. The systems use the Web as an application architecture (and not just as a transport layer), which facilitates the seamless integration of geographically distributed production cells. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented a prototypical production cell that uses industry-grade robots and an augmented reality interface for human workers. Together, these contributions demonstrate a means to achieve an intriguing vision for the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution: a global collective intelligence for manufacturing.},

Reasoning with GPTs connects the AAMAS community with other communities such as automated planning, and forms the foundation for important reasoning capabilities, especially intention progression in Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. Research on GPTs has a long history but suffers from fragmentation and lack of common terminology, data formats, and enabling tools. One way to address this fragmentation is through a competition. Competitions are increasingly being used as a means to foster research and challenge the state of the art. For example, the AAMAS conference has a number of associated competitions, such as the Trading Agent Competition, while agent research is showcased at competitions such as RoboCup. We therefore issue a call for a Goal-Plan Tree Contest, with the ambition of drawing together a community and incentivizing research in intention progression.},

Among the communication techniques in multi-agent systems, argumentation-based approaches have received special interest from the community, because they provide a rich form of communication by means of agents exchanging arguments. However, the additional information exchanged by agents could have an extra weight on the communication infrastructure, restricting the usage of argumentation techniques. In this work, we introduce an argumentation framework whereby agents are able to exchange fewer and shorter messages when engaging in dialogues by omitting information that is common knowledge (e.g., information about a shared multi-agent organisation). In particular, we use the idea of enthymemes, as well as referring to shared argumentation schemes (i.e., reasoning patterns from which such arguments were instantiated) and common organisational knowledge to guide argument reconstruction. We argue that the approach makes argumentation-based communication more efficient in the sense that agents can exchange fewer messages with shorter content, yet without any loss in the intended arguments.},

However, so far there has been no work on developing multiagent systems (MAS) where agents implemented and deployed in different agent-programming platforms can interact as part of the same MAS with a shared environment. Due to the generality of CARTAGO environments and its Java-based implementation, we have successfully implemented an open multi-agent system where heterogeneous agents developed with different platforms---namely Jason, 2APL as BDI-based approaches and simpA as an activity-oriented approach rather than BDI-based---work together in shared workspaces where they interact and cooperate by dynamically creating and using shared artifacts, analogously to human working environments. This paper shows how this was achieved by first presenting a general model for incorporating a theory of use and observation of artifacts in cognitive agents, then describing a general approach for developing such heterogeneous MAS using CARTAGO integrated with existing agent-oriented programming platforms.},

  abstract   = {Adjustable autonomy refers to entities dynamically varying their own autonomy, transferring decision-making control to other entities (typically agents transferring control to human users) in key situations. Determining whether and when such transfers-of-control should occur is arguably the fundamental research problem in adjustable autonomy. Previous work has investigated various approaches to addressing this problem but has often focused on individual agent-human interactions. Unfortunately, domains requiring collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key shortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use rigid one-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable coordination failures in multiagent settings. Second, they ignore costs (e.g., in terms of time delays or effects on actions) to an agent's team due to such transfers-of-control.To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel approach to adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control strategy. A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional sequence of two types of actions: (i) actions to transfer decision-making control (e.g., from an agent to a user or vice versa) and (ii) actions to change an agent's pre-specified coordination constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing miscoordination costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be made with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team. We present a mathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides and informs the operationalization of the strategies using Markov Decision Processes, which select an optimal strategy, given an uncertain environment and costs to the individuals and teams. The approach has been carefully evaluated, including via its use in a real-world, deployed multi-agent system that assists a research group in its daily activities.},

  abstract  = {Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is a practical and efficient approach to planning when the 'standard operating procedures' for a domain are available. Like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent reasoning, HTN planning performs hierarchical and context-based refinement of goals into subgoals and basic actions. However, while HTN planners 'lookahead' over the consequences of choosing one refinement over another, BDI agents interleave refinement with acting. There has been renewed interest in making HTN planners behave more like BDI agent systems, e.g. to have a unified representation for acting and planning. However, past work on the subject has remained informal or implementation-focused. This paper is a formal account of 'HTN acting', which supports interleaved deliberation, acting, and failure recovery. We use the syntax of the most general HTN planning formalism and build on its core semantics, and we provide an algorithm which combines our new formalism with the processing of exogenous events. We also study the properties of HTN acting and its relation to HTN planning.},

  abstract  = {BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) agent systems are very powerful, but they lack the ability to incorporate planning. There has been some previous work to incorporate planning within such systems. However, this has either focussed on producing low-level plan sequences, losing much of the domain knowledge inherent in BDI systems, or has been limited to HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning, which cannot find plans other than those specified by the programmer. In this work, we incorporate classical planning into a BDI agent, but in a way that respects and makes use of the procedural domain knowledge available, by producing abstract plans that can be executed using such knowledge. In doing so, we recognize an intrinsic tension between striving for abstract plans and, at the same time, ensuring that unnecessary actions, unrelated to the specific goal to be achieved, are avoided. We explore this tension, by first characterizing the set of "ideal" abstract plans that are non-redundant while maximally abstract, and then developing a more limited but feasible account in which an abstract plan is "specialized" into a new abstract plan that is non-redundant and preserves abstraction as much as possible. We describe an algorithm to compute such a plan specialization, as well as algorithms for the production of a valid high level plan, by deriving abstract planning operators from the BDI program.},

In particular, the so-called context conditions of plans, on which the whole model relies for plan selection, are restricted to be boolean formulas that are to be specified at design/implementation time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel BDI programming framework that, by suitably modeling context conditions as decision trees, allows agents to learn the probability of success for plans based on previous execution experiences. By using a probabilistic plan selection function, the agents can balance exploration and exploitation of their plans. We develop and empirically investigate two extreme approaches to learning the new context conditions and show that both can be advantageous in certain situations. Finally, we propose a generalization of the probabilistic plan selection function that yields a middle-ground between the two extreme approaches, and which we thus argue is the most flexible and simple approach.},
