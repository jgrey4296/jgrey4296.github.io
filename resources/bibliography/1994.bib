It uses, transforms and subverts the work of a number of distinguished male theorists of the body (Freud, Lacan, Merleau-Ponty, Schilder, Nietzsche, Foucault, Lingis and Deleuze) who, while freeing the body from its subordination to the mind, are nonetheless unable to accomodate the specificities of women's bodies. Volatile Bodies explores various dissonances in thinking the relation between mind and body. It investigates issues that resist reduction to these binary terms - psychosis, hypochondria, neurological disturbances, perversions and sexual deviation - and most particularly the enigmatic status of body fluids, and the female body.},

It gives an introduction to unification and resolution in Prolog and presents the memory model and a basic execution model. These models are expanded to the Vienna Abstract Machine (VAM) with its two versions, the VAM2p and the VAM1p, and the most famous abstract machine, the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). The continuation passing style model of Prolog, binary Prolog, leads to the BinWAM. Abstract interpretation can be applied to gather information about a program. This information is used in the generation of very specialized machine code and in optimizations like clause indexing and instruction scheduling on each kind of abstract machine.},

@article{lamport94_tempor_logic_action,
 abstract     = {This paper introduces TLA, which I now believe is the best general formalism for describing and reasoning about concurrent systems. The new idea in TLA is that one can use actions--formulas with primed and unprimed variables--in temporal formulas. An action describes a state-transition relation. For example, the action x'=x+1 means approximately the same thing as the programming-language statement x := x+1. However, the action is much simpler because it talks only about x and says nothing about another variable y, while the assignment statement may (or may not) assert that y doesn't change. TLA allows you to write specifications essentially the same way advocated in [82]. However, the specification becomes a single mathematical formula. This opens up a whole new realm of possibilities. Among other things, it provides an elegant way to formalize and systematize all the reasoning used in concurrent system verification. The moral of TLA is: if you're not writing a program, don't use a programming language. Programming languages are complicated and have many ugly properties because a program is input to a compiler that must generate reasonably efficient code. If you're describing an algorithm, not writing an actual program, you shouldn't burden yourselves with those complications and ugly properties. The toy concurrent programming languages with which computer scientists have traditionally described algorithms are not as bad as real programming languages, but they are still uglier and more complicated than they need to be. Such a toy program is no closer to a real C or Java program than is a TLA formula. And the TLA formula is a lot easier to deal with mathematically than is a toy program. (Everything I say about programming languages applies just as well to hardware description languages. However, hardware designers are generally more sensible than to try to use low-level hardware languages for higher-level system descriptions.) Had I only realized this 20 years ago! The first major step in getting beyond traditional programming languages to describe concurrent algorithms was Misra and Chandy's Unity. Unity simply eliminated the control state, so you just had a single global state that you reasoned about with a single invariant. You can structure the invariant any way you want; you're not restricted by the particular programming constructs with which the algorithm is described. The next step was TLA, which eliminated the programming language and allowed you to write your algorithm directly in mathematics. This provides a much more powerful and flexible way of describing the next-state relation. An amusing footnote to this paper is that, after reading an earlier draft, Simon Lam claimed that he deserved credit for the idea of describing actions as formulas with primed and unprimed variables. A similar notation for writing postconditions dates from the 70s, but that's not the same as actually specifying the action in this way. I had credited Rick Hehner's 1984 CACM article, but I figured there were probably earlier instances. After a modest amount of investigation, I found one earlier published use--in [50].},

@article{lewin94_dynam_theor_organ_knowl_creat_5,
 abstract     = {This paper proposes a paradigm for managing the dynamic aspects of organizational knowledge creating processes. Its central theme is that organizational knowledge is created through a continuous dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge. The nature of this dialogue is examined and four patterns of interaction involving tacit and explicit knowledge are identified. It is argued that while new knowledge is developed by individuals, organizations play a critical role in articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical framework is developed which provides an analytical per- spective on the constituent dimensions of knowledge cre- ation. This framework is then applied in two operational models for facilitating the dynamic creation of appropriate organizational knowledge.},

@inproceedings{reynolds94_introd_to_cultur_algor_172,
 abstract     = {In this paper a computational model of the cultural evolution process is described. This model integrates several traditional approaches to modeling cultural evolution into a common conceptual framework. This framework depicts cultural evolution as a process of dual inheritance. At the micro-evolutionary level there is a population of individuals, each described in terms of a set of behavioral traits. Traits are passed from generation to generation at this level by means of a number of socially motivated operators. At the macro-evolutionary level, individuals are able to generate "mappa" that generalize on their experience. These individual mappa can be merged to form group mappa and these group mappa can be generalized and specialized using a variety of generic and problem specific operators. A specific implementation of Cultural Algorithms is described using Genetic Algorithms to represent the population space and Version spaces (or lattices) to represent the set of possible schemata that can be produced via generalizations on the population space. Individual and group mappa are defined as subspaces within the lattice. It is shown how the addition of a belief space to the traditional Genetic Algorithm framework can affect the rate at which learning can take place in terms of the modifications that it produces in the traditional schema theorem for Genetic Algorithms.},

@inproceedings{stamper94_organ_dynam_social_norms_infor_system_4,
 abstract     = {An organisation is defined as a system of social norms. The concept of a norm is the social analogue of the concept of an affordance which Gibson (1968) introduced to account for perception of the physical world. Their conjunction is a logic of Norms and Affordances, Norma, which serves as a meta-model for dynamic organisational systems. All elements in a Norma model have bounded periods of existence. All the dynamics are specified by the authorities governing these bounds. A system to implement Norma has been constructed, called a 'Normbase' handles time intrinsically to achieve a huge reduction in the complexity of a specification. The Normbase allows a system to be prototyped dynamically, as the specification evolves. These methods have been used with great success in reducing implementation and maintenance costs.},

@book{ten94_routl_histor_philos,
 abstract     = {The nineteenth century was a period of intense intellectual activity with advances being made in the sciences, in mathematics and in psychology which gradually established itself as a discipline independent of philosophy. Philosophical disputes arose about the nature of scientific method and about whether, or to what extent, the understanding of human conduct and human society required the adoption of the methods of observation and experiment common to the natural sciences. Different philosophical theories about the nature of reality, the foundations of knowledge and of morality, and the limits of individual freedom were systematically developed, and many such theories are still very much alive in contemporary philosophical debates. The philosophers discussed in this volume include those belonging both to the 'analytic' and the 'continental' traditions, as well as the now influential American pragmatists. Each chapter is written by a different author who presents the issues in the context of the period in which they arose, while also keeping an eye on their relevance to current philosophical interests. A few philosophers are discussed in more than one chapter, in different but mutually illuminating contexts. Each chapter in The Nineteenth Century is self-contained and makes a distinctive contribution to a set of philosophical problems. This volume provides a broad, scholarly introduction to nineteenth-century philosophy. It also contains a glossary of philosophical terms and a chronological table of philosophical and cultural events.},
