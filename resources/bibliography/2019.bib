 abstract     = {Semantic Web applications often require the partitioning of triples into subgraphs, and then associating them with useful metadata (e.g., provenance). This led to the introduction of RDF datasets, with each RDF dataset comprising a default graph and zero or more named graphs. However, due to differences in RDF implementations, no consensus could be reached on a standard semantics; and a range of different dataset semantics are currently assumed. For an RDF system not be limited to only a subset of online RDF datasets, the system would need to be extended to support different dataset semantics-exactly the problem that eluded consensus before. In this paper, we transpose this problem to Notation3 Logic, an RDF-based rule language that similarly allows citing graphs within RDF documents. We propose a solution where an N3 author can directly indicate the intended semantics of a cited graph- possibly, combining multiple semantics within a single document. We supply an initial set of companion N3 rules, which implement a number of RDF dataset semantics, which allow an N3-compliant system to easily support multiple different semantics.},

@article{capers19_afrof_critic_race_theor_polic_year_94,
 abstract     = {In 2044, the United States is projected to become a "majority-minority" country, with people of color making up more than half of the population. And yet in the public imagination-from Robocop to Minority Report, from Star Trek to Star Wars, from A Clockwork Orange to 1984 to Brave New World-the future is usu- ally envisioned as majority white. What might the future look like in year 2044, when people of color make up the majority in terms of numbers, or in the ensuing years, when they also wield the majority of political and economic power? And specifically, what might policing look like? This Article attempts to answer these questions by examining how artists, cybertheorists, and speculative scholars of color-Afrofuturists and Critical Race Theorists-have imagined the future. What can we learn from Afrofuturism, the term given to "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns [in the con- text of] techno culture?" And what can we learn from Critical Race Theory and its "father" Derrick Bell, who famously wrote of space explorers to examine issues of race and law? What do they imagine policing to be, and what can we imagine policing to be in a brown and black world?},

 abstract     = {In this paper we discuss the problems of modern representative democracy and we look at the random selection of legislators as an extreme form of the proportional political representation, arguing that it is the way to make representative democracy as close to direct democracy as possible. In this respect we present a new mathematical model which attempts at describing a more efficient parliament where part of the members are selected by lot. It will be shown that starting from a parliament working with two parties (or coalitions), where the costs of representative democracy are quite apparent, one can beneficially move towards a parliament where independent legislators, randomly selected from the population of constituents, sit alongside with party members. The paper shows that increasing the number of independent legislators up to a point enhances the efficiency of the parliament.},

@inproceedings{chopra19_sociot_system_ethic_large_,
 abstract     = {Advances in AI techniques and computing platforms have triggered a lively and expanding discourse on ethical decision-making by autonomous agents. Much recent work in AI concentrates on the challenges of moral decision making from a decision-theoretic perspective, and especially the representation of various ethical dilemmas. Such approaches may be useful but in general are not productive because moral decision making is as context-driven as other forms of decision making, if not more. In contrast, we consider ethics not from the standpoint of an individual agent but of the wider sociotechnical systems (STS) in which the agent operates. Our contribution in this paper is the conception of ethical STS founded on governance that takes into account stakeholder values, normative constraints on agents, and outcomes (states of the STS) that obtain due to actions taken by agents. An important element of our conception is accountability, which is necessary for adequate consideration of outcomes that prima facie appear ethical or unethical. Focusing on STSs avoids the difficult problems of ethics as the norms of the STS give an operational basis for agent decision making.},

@inproceedings{ciortea19_decad_hinds,
 abstract     = {The World Wide Web has evolved drastically over the past decade -- and the proliferation of Web APIs has turned it into the middleware of choice for most distributed systems. The recent focus on hypermedia-driven APIs together with initiatives such as the Web of Things and Linked Data are now promoting and advancing the development of a new generation of dynamic, open, and long-lived systems on the Web. These systems require agent-based solutions to the point that Web researchers have started to build autonomous systems on their own. It is thus both timely and necessary to investigate and align the latest developments in Web research and multi-agent systems (MAS) research. We argue that the answer lies equally in a lack of practical use cases as well as the premature development and alignment of Web and agent technologies. We then present our vision for a new generation of autonomous systems on the Web, which we call hypermedia MAS, together with the research opportunities and challenges they bring.},

@article{ganguly19_effec_early_life_stres_cocain_,
 abstract     = {Exposure to early life adversity can predispose adolescents to the formation of substance abuse disorders. In rodents, early stressors such as repeated maternal separation (MS) impact AMPAR activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), regions involved in drug-cue association after cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Notably, previous reports suggest that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) regulates AMPAR subunit composition; increased TNF levels are reported to reduce GluA2-positive AMPARs. Since MS can elevate adolescent TNF levels, the stressor may therefore alter AMPAR subunit composition via neuroimmune signaling, thereby affecting cocaine-induced CPP. We tested the specific role of soluble TNF in MS-induced GluA2 loss and cocaine-induced CPP with biologic disruption of TNF signaling. TNF gene and protein expression were elevated in both PFC and NAc of MS males, but not females. GluA2 expression was reduced in both regions in only male MS rats, and systemic treatment with either ibudilast - a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, or XPro1595 - a blood-brain barrier-permeable blocker of soluble TNF - reversed such loss. MS males also formed greater preference for a cocaine-paired environment, the expression of which returned to control levels after XPro1595 administration. These data suggest a sex-specific mechanistic link between TNF signaling and changes in GluA2 expression and drug-cue conditioning, thereby providing further evidence for a role of MS and neuro-immune activity in cortical and striatal AMPAR changes. Moreover, manipulation of the TNF signaling pathway represents a novel approach for influencing response to reinforcing effects of drug use.},

 abstract     = {In Gathergood et al. (2019), we studied credit card repayments using linked data on multiple cards from the United Kingdom. We showed that individuals did not allocate payments to the higher interest rate card, which would minimize the cost of borrowing, but instead made repayments according to a balance-matching heuristic under which the share of repayments on each card is matched to the share of balances on each card. In this paper, we examine whether these results extend to the United States using a large sample of TransUnion credit bureau data. These data do not have interest rates, so we cannot examine the optimality of payments. However, we observe balances and repayments, so we can examine balance-matching behavior. We replicate our analysis and find that Americans also repay their debt in accordance with a balance-matching heuristic.},

This phenomenological study on the causes of burnout among racial justice activists in the United States was designed to bolster understandings of burnout and inform strategies for sustaining racial justice movements. Thirty racial justice activists who had experienced burnout were interviewed. They described four primary burnout causes: emotional-dispositional causes, structural causes, backlash causes, and in-movement causes. Implications for activist and movement sustainability are discussed.},

@misc{gratton19_from_weber_to_kafka_,
 abstract     = {A well functioning bureaucracy can promote prosperity, as Max Weber maintained. But when bureaucracy gets jammed-a Kafkian situation-it causes stagnation. We propose a dynamic theory of the interaction between legislation and the efficiency of bureaucracy. When bureaucracy is inefficient, the effects of politicians' legislative acts are hard to assess. Incompetent politicians thus have strong incentives of passing laws to acquire the reputation of skillful reformers. But a plethora of often contradictory laws can itself lead to a collapse in bureaucratic efficiency. This interaction can spawn both Weberian and Kafkian steady states. A temporary surge in political instability, which increases the likelihood of a premature end of the legislature, exerts pressure for reforms, or results in the appointment of short-lived technocratic governments can determine a permanent shift towards the nightmare Kafkian steady state. The aggregate experience of Italy in its transition from the so-called First to the Second Republic fits the narrative of the model quite well. Using micro-data for Italian MPs, we also provide evidence consistent with the claim that when political instability is high, politicians signal their competence through legislative activism, which leads to the overproduction of laws and norms.},

@inproceedings{hohman19_gamut_,
 abstract     = {Without good models and the right tools to interpret them, data scientists risk making decisions based on hidden biases, spurious correlations, and false generalizations. This has led to a rallying cry for model interpretability. Yet the concept of interpretability remains nebulous, such that researchers and tool designers lack actionable guidelines for how to incorporate interpretability into models and accompanying tools. Through an iterative design process with expert machine learning researchers and practitioners, we designed a visual analytics system, Gamut, to explore how interactive interfaces could better support model interpretation. Using Gamut as a probe, we investigated why and how professional data scientists interpret models, and how interface af-fordances can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability. Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept: data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences, often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness. Participants also asked to use Gamut in their work, highlighting its potential to help data scientists understand their own data. CCS CONCEPTS \textbullet  Human-centered computing $i̊ghtarrow$ Empirical studies in visualization; Visualization systems and tools; \textbullet  Computing methodologies $\g̊htarrow$ Machine learning. 1 INTRODUCTION With recent advances in machine learning (ML) [29, 37, 58, 65], people are beginning to use ML to address important societal problems like identifying and predicting cancerous cells [14, 32], predicting poverty from satellite imagery to inform policy decisions [27], and locating buildings that are susceptible to catching on fire [43, 59]. Unfortunately, the metrics by which models are trained and evaluated often hide biases, spurious correlations, and false generalizations inside complex, internal structure. These pitfalls are nuanced, particularly to novices, and cannot be diagnosed with simple quality metrics, like a single accuracy number [66]. This is troublesome when ML is misused, with intent or ignorance , in situations where ethics and fairness are paramount. Lacking an explanation for how models perform can lead to biased and ill-informed decisions, like representing gender bias in facial analysis systems [7], propagating historical cultural stereotypes in text corpora into widely used AI components [8], and biasing recidivism predictions by race [3]. This is the problem of model interpretability.},

We examine the advantages of ABMS methods using three case studies of electricity market models as example (AMIRIS, EMLab-Generation and PowerACE). In particular, we argue why ABMS might serve as framework for many future energy system models that integrate many different algorithms. We then discuss practical and theoretical problems in the development, validation and assessment of energy-system-analytical ABMS and conclude with an outlook and recommendations for energy system modellers who consider incorporating ABMS into their modelling toolbox.},

@article{koch19_earth_system_impac_europ_arriv_207,
 abstract     = {Human impacts prior to the Industrial Revolution are not well constrained. We investigate whether the decline in global atmospheric CO2 concentration by 7-10 ppm in the late 1500s and early 1600s which globally lowered surface air temperatures by 0.15∘C, were generated by natural forcing or were a result of the large-scale depopulation of the Americas after European arrival, subsequent land use change and secondary succession. We quantitatively review the evidence for (i) the pre-Columbian population size, (ii) their per capita land use, (iii) the post-1492 population loss, (iv) the resulting carbon uptake of the abandoned anthropogenic landscapes, and then compare these to potential natural drivers of global carbon declines of 7-10 ppm. From 119 published regional population estimates we calculate a pre-1492 CE population of 60.5 million (interquartile range, IQR 44.8-78.2 million), utilizing 1.04 ha land per capita (IQR 0.98-1.11). European epidemics removed 90 \% (IQR 87-92 \%) of the indigenous population over the next century. This resulted in secondary succession of 55.8 Mha (IQR 39.0-78.4 Mha) of abandoned land, sequestering 7.4 Pg C (IQR 4.9-10.8 Pg C), equivalent to a decline in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm (IQR 2.3-5.1 ppm CO2). Accounting for carbon cycle feedbacks plus LUC outside the Americas gives a total 5 ppm CO2 additional uptake into the land surface in the 1500s compared to the 1400s, 47-67 \% of the atmospheric CO2 decline. Furthermore, we show that the global carbon budget of the 1500s cannot be balanced until large-scale vegetation regeneration in the Americas is included. The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth System in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution.},

@article{lopez19_do_all_black_lives_matter_,
 abstract     = {Cathy Cohen's (1999) theory of secondary marginalization helps to explain why the needs of some members of Black communities are not prioritized on "the" Black political agenda; indeed, some groups are ignored altogether as mainstream Black public opinion shifts to the right (Tate 2010). However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements? We analyze data from the 2016 Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to assess whether all Black lives matter to Black Americans.},

 abstract     = {Social simulations gain strength when agent behaviour can (1) represent human behaviour and (2) be explained in understandable terms. Agents with values and norms lead to simulation results that meet human needs for explanations, but have not been tested on their ability to reproduce human behaviour. This paper compares empirical data on human behaviour to simulated data on agents with values and norms in a psychological experiment on dividing money: the ultimatum game. We find that our agent model with values and norms produces aggregate behaviour that falls within the 95 \% confidence interval wherein human behaviour lies more often than other tested agent models. A main insight is that values serve as a static component in agent behaviour, whereas norms serve as a dynamic component.},

 abstract     = {This paper considers possible futures for human space settlements through the life story and experiences of David Vetter-a child born with severe combined immunodeﬁciency who became known in popular media as the "bubble boy." Lynn Margulis imagined the creation of ecosystems and human settlements on another planet could be an act of Gaia reproducing by budding, through ecopoiesis. Thinking with Margulis about humans as holobionts, our species is both constituted by and embedded within communities of organisms and ecologies. As holobionts we may not be able to live outside of these communities and systems or away from Earth, even if we can temporarily survive without them. Placed within an evolutionary framework, techno-capitalist imaginaries of space settlement limit conceptions of planetary reproduction to heteronormative models of ecopoiesis which promote competition as a key driver of evolution instead of cooperation. Technologically mediated survival along with forced reproduction of holobionts within Earth-like systems and could lead to suffering and isolation like David Vetter's forced survival in a bubble.

 abstract     = {Two of the primary reasons rainbow color maps are considered ineffective trace back to the idea that they implicitly discretize encoded data into hue-based bands, yet no research addresses what this discretization looks like or how consistent it is across individuals. This paper presents an exploratory study designed to empirically investigate the implicit discretization of common spectral schemes and explore whether the phenomenon can be modeled by variations in lightness, chroma, and hue. Our results suggest that three commonly used rainbow color maps are implicitly discretized with consistency across individuals. The results also indicate, however, that this implicit discretization varies across different datasets, in a way that suggests the visualization community's understanding of both rainbow color maps, and more generally effective color usage, remains incomplete.},

Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans. We lay forth an argument that human-centered artificial intelligence can be broken down into two aspects: (1) AI systems that understand humans from a sociocultural perspective, and (2) AI systems that help humans understand them. We further argue that issues of social responsibility such as fairness, accountability, interpretability, and transparency.},

@article{sap19_atomic_,
 abstract     = {We present ATOMIC, an atlas of everyday commonsense reasoning, organized through 877k textual descriptions of inferential knowledge. Compared to existing resources that center around taxonomic knowledge, ATOMIC focuses on inferential knowledge organized as typed if-then relations with variables (e.g., "if X pays Y a compliment, then Y will likely return the compliment"). We propose nine if-then relation types to distinguish causes vs. effects, agents vs. themes, voluntary vs. involuntary events, and actions vs. mental states. By generatively training on the rich inferential knowledge described in ATOMIC, we show that neural models can acquire simple commonsense capabilities and reason about previously unseen events. Experimental results demonstrate that multitask models that incorporate the hierarchical structure of if-then relation types lead to more accurate inference compared to models trained in isolation, as measured by both automatic and human evaluation.},
