 abstract     = {The 3.11 compounded disaster in Tohoku, Japan served as catalyst for some nations, including Germany, Belgium, and Italy, to alter nuclear policies but had no impact on the approaches of a number of others such as Vietnam, China, and Russia. Our article investigates why, despite facing the same focusing event, private- and state-owned utilities in some countries altered their nuclear energy policies while others kept the status quo. We use a mixed-methods approach to understand this variation in energy policy outcomes. Our quantitative analysis of 84 countries based on a new, sui generis dataset shows that Green Party vote share and strong voice/accountability are negatively correlated with changes in nuclear power programs while media openness and political stability are positively connected with atomic energy decisions. Using in-depth case studies of Germany and Japan we further explore the role of domestic political institutions and country-specific norms to show more precisely how actors interacted with ideas to influence energy decisions. This article brings implications for the future of energy policies around the world at a time when many hope to see a ``nuclear renaissance.''},

This debate largely sidesteps two questions that are central to understanding the future of international order: how strong is the current Western hegemonic order and what is the likelihood that China can or will lead a successful counterhegemonic challenge? We argue that the future of international order is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution of identity across the great powers. We develop a constructivist account of hegemonic transition and stability that theorizes the role of the distribution of identity in international order. In our account, hegemonic orders depend on a legitimating ideology that must be consistent with the distribution of identity at the level of both elites and masses. We map the distribution of identity across nine great powers and assess how this distribution supports the current Western neoliberal democratic hegemony. We conclude that China is unlikely to become the hegemon in the near term.},

 abstract     = {A common objection to ``sin taxes''-corrective taxes on goods that are thought to be over-consumed, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary drinks-is that they often fall disproportionately on low-income consumers. This paper studies the interaction between corrective and redistributive motives in a general optimal taxation framework. We show that the implications of regressivity hinge on why consumption decreases with income. If the consumption-income relationship is driven by income effects, then regressivity is optimally offset by targeted transfers or income tax reforms, not by moderating the level of the sin tax. If the relationship is instead driven by between-income preference heterogeneity, the optimal sin tax depends on the demand elasticity: if demand is more elastic, then progressive benefits from reduced over-consumption can make the optimal sin tax larger than if there were no distributional concerns, while if demand is less elastic, the optimal tax is reduced. As an application, we estimate the optimal nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, using Nielsen Homescan data and a specially designed survey measuring nutrition knowledge and self-control. Our empirical estimates of elasticities, preference heterogeneity, incorrect beliefs, and self-control imply that current city-level taxes in Berkeley, San Francisco, and elsewhere are actually lower than the social optimum.},

With the arrival of digital photo-manipulation tools, this experimentation has undergone a radical expansion, giving rise to a great variety of approaches that play with photographic imagery in order to produce impossible but fascinating architectural scenarios. This article focuses on the work of Jim Kazanjian, an author coming from the realm of digital building who, working on the fringes of the discipline, has produced throughout the last decad, a body of work that combines technical prowess with the fascination with the somber atmospheres of H.P.

 abstract     = {The lasting effects of slavery on contemporary political attitudes in the American SouthDespite dramatic social transformations in the United States during the last 150 years, the South has remained staunchly conservative. Southerners are more likely to support Republican candidates, gun rights, and the death penalty, and southern whites harbor higher levels of racial resentment than whites in other parts of the country. Why haven't these sentiments evolved or changed? Deep Roots shows that the entrenched political and racial views of contemporary white southerners are a direct consequence of the region's slaveholding history, which continues to shape economic, political, and social spheres. Today, southern whites who live in areas once reliant on slavery--compared to areas that were not--are more racially hostile and less amenable to policies that could promote black progress. Highlighting the connection between historical institutions and contemporary political attitudes, the authors explore the period following the Civil War when elite whites in former bastions of slavery had political and economic incentives to encourage the development of anti-black laws and practices. Deep Roots shows that these forces created a local political culture steeped in racial prejudice, and that these viewpoints have been passed down over generations, from parents to children and via communities, through a process called behavioral path dependence. While legislation such as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act made huge strides in increasing economic opportunity and reducing educational disparities, southern slavery has had a profound, lasting, and self-reinforcing influence on regional and national politics that can still be felt today. A groundbreaking look at the ways institutions of the past continue to sway attitudes of the present, Deep Roots demonstrates how social beliefs persist long after the formal policies that created those beliefs have been eradicated.},

 abstract     = {BACKGROUND Comprehensive literature reviews of historical perspectives and evidence supporting cannabis/cannabinoids in the treatment of pain, including migraine and headache, with associated neurobiological mechanisms of pain modulation have been well described. Most of the existing literature reports on the cannabinoids  9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), or cannabis in general. There are many cannabis strains that vary widely in the composition of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds. These components work synergistically to produce wide variations in benefits, side effects, and strain characteristics. Knowledge of the individual medicinal properties of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids is necessary to cross-breed strains to obtain optimal standardized synergistic compositions. This will enable targeting individual symptoms and/or diseases, including migraine, headache, and pain. OBJECTIVE Review the medical literature for the use of cannabis/cannabinoids in the treatment of migraine, headache, facial pain, and other chronic pain syndromes, and for supporting evidence of a potential role in combatting the opioid epidemic. Review the medical literature involving major and minor cannabinoids, primary and secondary terpenes, and flavonoids that underlie the synergistic entourage effects of cannabis. Summarize the individual medicinal benefits of these substances, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSION There is accumulating evidence for various therapeutic benefits of cannabis/cannabinoids, especially in the treatment of pain, which may also apply to the treatment of migraine and headache. There is also supporting evidence that cannabis may assist in opioid detoxification and weaning, thus making it a potential weapon in battling the opioid epidemic. Cannabis science is a rapidly evolving medical sector and industry with increasingly regulated production standards. Further research is anticipated to optimize breeding of strain-specific synergistic ratios of cannabinoids, terpenes, and other phytochemicals for predictable user effects, characteristics, and improved symptom and disease-targeted therapies.},

Despite the increasing acceptance of this paradigm, several aspects of the approach remain underdeveloped. Specifically, limitations arise from a reliance on a twins-only design, and all previous studies have used self-reports only. There are also questions about the extent to which existing findings generalize cross-culturally. To address those issues, this study examined individual differences in liberalism/conservatism in a German sample that included twins, their parents, and their spouses and incorporated both self- and peer reports. The self-report findings from this extended twin family design were largely consistent with previous research that used that rater perspective, but they provided higher estimates of heritability, shared parental environmental influences, assortative mating, and genotype-environment correlation than the results from peer reports. The implications of these findings for the measurement and understanding of sociopolitical attitudes are explored.},

 abstract     = {Videogames and the gaming industry in the 21st-century generate more employment and revenue than either the professional music industry or the Hollywood film industry, making videogames both highly lucrative and extremely influential on a cultural level. When we consider the significance of cultural artifacts-like videogames, or television, films, or books-on the development of cultural mores and our understanding of society, leadership, and followership, it is therefore important that we consider the influence of an industry as large and widespread as the games industry. In this article, I examine the particular influence of an online movement known as ``GamerGate,'' how it connects to the history and origins of the internet and videogames, how it connects to the subsequent rise of the alt-right, and what we can learn about the alt-right as a small but significant portion of contemporary Western culture-including what we need to do to dismantle it.},

What is not so readily examined is the flip side of historical trauma experienced by settlers and their descendants, what might be termed ``historical privilege''. These historic acts of privilege for settlers, particularly those emigrating from Britain, provide the antecedents for the current-day realities for their descendants and the structural, institutional and interpersonal levels of advantage that are also a key feature of inequities between Indigenous and settler. This article theorises an explicit link between historical trauma and historical privilege and explores how the latter may be examined with particular reference to Aotearoa New Zealand. Three core elements of historical trauma are posited as a useful framework to apply to historical privilege.},

However, until now there has been no clear understanding of how to define fake news, much less how to model it. This paper addresses both these issues. A definition of fake news is given, and two approaches for the modelling of fake news and its impact in elections and referendums are introduced. The first approach, based on the idea of a representative voter, is shown to be suitable to obtain a qualitative understanding of phenomena associated with fake news at a macroscopic level. The second approach, based on the idea of an election microstructure, describes the collective behaviour of the electorate by modelling the preferences of individual voters. It is shown through a simulation study that the mere knowledge that pieces of fake news may be in circulation goes a long way towards mitigating the impact of fake news.},

We find significant increases in religiosity and income, no significant changes in total labor supply, assets, consumption, food security, or life satisfaction, and a significant decrease in perceived relative economic status. Exploratory analysis suggests the program may have improved hygienic practices and increased household discord, and that the income treatment effect may operate through increasing grit.},

These seek to increase the effectiveness and democratic quality of policy making by involving citizens in policy. However, these have mainly operated at local levels of governance, and democratic theorists and practitioners have developed an ambition to scale these up in order to democratize higher tiers of government. This paper draws policy lessons from research on a ``multi-level'' process that held a similar ambition. The Sustainable Communities Act sought to integrate the results of various locally organized citizen deliberations within the policy development processes of central UK government. In doing so, it aimed to democratize central government problem definition and agenda-setting processes. The paper distinguishes between achievements and failures explained by process design, and more fundamental obstacles to do with broader contextual factors. As such, it identifies lessons for the a...},

Surprisingly, the price drops of these bonds are larger than of bonds that were trading in less liquid markets. We argue that this is because institutions fail to internalize the negative effect selling common bonds has on other market participants. After controlling for commonality of bonds, liquid bonds exhibit smaller price impacts in fire sales. Regulatory measures of systemic risk should thus take into account the portfolio overlap in liquid bonds as it exacerbates fire-sale losses.},

 abstract     = {A fundamental algorithmic problem at the heart of static analysis is Dyck reachability. The input is a graph where the edges are labeled with different types of opening and closing parentheses, and the reachability information is computed via paths whose parentheses are properly matched. We present new results for Dyck reachability problems with applications to alias analysis and data-dependence analysis. Our main contributions, that include improved upper bounds as well as lower bounds that establish optimality guarantees, are as follows: First, we consider Dyck reachability on bidirected graphs, which is the standard way of performing field-sensitive points-to analysis. Given a bidirected graph with n nodes and m edges, we present: (i) an algorithm with worst-case running time O(m + n {\textperiodcentered}  (n)), where   (n) is the inverse Ackermann function, improving the previously known O(n2) time bound; (ii) a matching lower bound that shows that our algorithm is optimal wrt to worst-case complexity; and (iii) an optimal average-case upper bound of O(m) time, improving the previously known O(m {\textperiodcentered}logn) bound. Second, we consider the problem of context-sensitive data-dependence analysis, where the task is to obtain analysis summaries of library code in the presence of callbacks. Our algorithm preprocesses libraries in almost linear time, after which the contribution of the library in the complexity of the client analysis is only linear, and only wrt the number of call sites. Third, we prove that combinatorial algorithms for Dyck reachability on general graphs with truly sub-cubic bounds cannot be obtained without obtaining sub-cubic combinatorial algorithms for Boolean Matrix Multiplication, which is a long-standing open problem. Thus we establish that the existing combinatorial algorithms for Dyck reachability are (conditionally) optimal for general graphs. We also show that the same hardness holds for graphs of constant treewidth. Finally, we provide a prototype implementation of our algorithms for both alias analysis and data-dependence analysis. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new algorithms significantly outperform all existing methods on the two problems, over real-world benchmarks.},

By introducing a population dependent time-constant in the generalized growth transform model, the proposed framework can be used to explain a vast repertoire of evolutionary dynamics, including some novel forms of game dynamics with non-linear payoffs.},

 abstract     = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) have long been envisioned as a key enabling technology in manufacturing, but this promise is yet to be realized: the lack of proper models, architectures, tooling, and the high level of expertise required for designing and programming agent-based manufacturing systems have hindered their large-scale acceptance. The emerging Web of Things (WoT), now being standardized at the W3C and IETF, provides new research opportunities that could help MAS enter the mainstream. In this paper, we present an approach to design scalable and flexible agent-based manufacturing systems that integrates automated planning with multi-agent oriented programming for the WoT: autonomous agents synthesize production plans using semantic descriptions of Web-based artifacts and coordinate with one another via multi-agent organizations; engineers can program and repurpose the systems on the fly via an intuitive Web user interface. The systems use the Web as an application architecture (and not just as a transport layer), which facilitates the seamless integration of geographically distributed production cells. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented a prototypical production cell that uses industry-grade robots and an augmented reality interface for human workers. Together, these contributions demonstrate a means to achieve an intriguing vision for the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution: a global collective intelligence for manufacturing.},

 abstract     = {From a particular vantage point, as an African-born scholar with a politics to affirm my Black subjectivity and Indigeneity in a diasporic context, my article engages a (re)theorization of Blackness for decolonial politics. Building on existing works of how Black scholars, themselves, have theorized Blackness, and recognizing the fluid, intersecting, and contested nature of this concept, I engage a multidimensional reading of Blackness, in part as a counter to the insidious attempts to delegitimize Black radical/racial politics. The article grounds particular struggles at the curious interface of skin, body, psyche, hegemonies, and politics. The article, in particular, responds to the perceived tensions between race, Blackness, and Indigeneity, offering a way of rereading Blackness differently: (a) to include Africa(ness), as a strategic reinvention of Africanness in diasporic contexts; (b) to reclaim an African Indigeneity in global knowledge production as a way of knowing that speaks to histories, cultures, identities, African spiritual ontologies, and a politics of the African/Black body; (c) to undertake a conscious intellectual shift in reading Black/African diasporic presence on Indigenous peoples Lands from a discursive prism of ``colonial settlerhood'' and discourses of ``complicities in our claims of citizenship'' to one of ''collective implications'' and ''differential responsibilities'' so as to foster decolonization and, particularly, decolonial solidarities among colonized, oppressed, and Indigenous peoples; (d) to highlight questions of the responsibilities of the Black/African learner in the (Western) academy; and (e) to reread Black(ness) in ways that speaks to the continental African subject who may decry the color descriptor of Black(ness).

The study also exploits a spatial discontinuity across neighboring military regions that pursued different counterinsurgency strategies. A strategy emphasizing overwhelming firepower plausibly increased insurgent attacks and worsened attitudes toward the U.S. and South Vietnamese government, relative to a more hearts-and-minds-oriented approach.},

Behavioral biases, intensified by complexity and uncertainty in the admissions and aid process, may explain this gap. In a large-scale experiment we test an early commitment of free tuition at a flagship university. The intervention did not increase aid: rather, students were guaranteed before application the same grant aid that they would qualify for in expectation after admission. The offer substantially increased application (68 percent vs 26 percent) and enrollment rates (27 percent vs 12 percent). The results suggest that uncertainty, present bias, and loss aversion loom large in students' college decisions.},

Due to its simplicity and usefulness, it is imported into various pattern-matching systems other than regular expressions. For example, Mathematica has a similar pattern construct called the repeated pattern. However, they have the following limitations: (i) We cannot change the pattern repeated depending on the current repeat count, and (ii) we cannot apply them to arbitrary data structures such as trees and graphs other than lists. This paper proposes the loop patterns that overcome these limitations. This paper presents numerous working examples and formal semantics of the loop patterns. The examples in this paper are coded in the Egison programming language, which features the customizable non-linear pattern-matching facility for non-free data types.},

We also show that consumers are more likely to trade with dissimilar partners when the sellers have eBay's quality certification, providing suggestive evidence that consumers favor culturally similar trading partners because they infer higher seller quality. },

The association between time discounting and the position in the wealth distribution is significant and of the same magnitude as the association between length of education and the position in the wealth distribution, and it exists after controlling for education, school grades, income, initial wealth, parental wealth, and credit constraints. Our results are consistent with the prediction of standard life-cycle savings theory that differences in time preferences generate differences in savings behavior and thereby wealth inequality},

Using cross-city variation in the emergence of these markets, we show that the resulting violence has important long-term implications for understanding current levels of murder rates by age, sex and race. We estimate that the murder rate of young black males doubled soon after crack's entrance into a city, and that these rates were still 70 percent higher 17 years after crack's arrival. We document the role of increased gun possession as a mechanism for this increase. Following previous work, we show that the fraction of suicides by firearms is a good proxy for gun availability and that this variable among young black males follows a similar trajectory to murder rates. Access to guns by young black males explains their elevated murder rates today compared to older cohorts. The long run effects of this increase in violence are large. We attribute nearly eight percent of the murders in 2000 to the long-run effects of the emergence of crack markets. Elevated murder rates for younger black males continue through to today and can explain approximately one tenth of the gap in life expectancy between black and white males.},

Drawing from recent findings in the life sciences, this article offers a cultural neuroscience approach to deterrence decision-making, with special attention given to the ways in which culture interacts with cognition and the security environment to shape behavioral outcomes during conflict. Since North Korea remains largely a ``black box'' in international relations, a cultural neuroscience perspective can provide valuable insight into the effects of cultural conditioning on perception and cognition within the context of nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula. Through an analysis of the bureaucratic and military structures, leadership characteristics, and institutional landscapes shaping North Korean strategic culture, this article examines the influences of historical memory and cultural values, such as collectivism, honor, and face-saving, on political decision-making in Pyongyang.},

 abstract     = {Cooking typically involves a plethora of decisions about ingredients and tools that need to be chosen in order to write a good cooking recipe. Cooking can be modelled in an optimization framework, as it involves a search space of ingredients, kitchen tools, cooking times or temperatures. If we model as an objective function the quality of the recipe, several problems arise. No analytical expression can model all the recipes, so no gradients are available. The objective function is subjective , in other words, it contains noise. Moreover, evaluations are expensive both in time and human resources. Bayesian Optimization (BO) emerges as an ideal methodology to tackle problems with these characteristics. In this paper, we propose a methodology to suggest recipe recommendations based on a Machine Learning (ML) model that fits real and simulated data and BO. We provide empirical evidence with two experiments that support the adequacy of the methodology.},

 abstract     = {Measured between quarters with identical unemployment rates, U. S. economic growth slowed by more than half from 3.2 percent per year during 1970-2006 to only 1.4 percent during 2006-16, and only half of this GDP growth slowdown is accounted for diminished productivity growth. The paper starts from the proposition that GDP growth matters, not just productivity growth, because slower GDP growth provides fewer resources to address the nation's problems, including faltering education, aging infrastructure, and the looming shortfall in funding for Social Security and Medicare, and it also implies lower net investment and a reduced rate at which new capital can embody the latest technology. The paper documents the contribution to slower GDP growth of the separate components of demography -- fertility, mortality, life expectancy, and immigration. Particular emphasis is placed on the interaction between rising inequality and the slower secular rise of life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other developed countries, both in the form of a large gap in life expectancy between rich and poor, and the stagnation of life expectancy for the lowest income quintile. Further contributions to slowing growth are made by a decline in the population share of both legal and illegal immigration and a turnaround from rising to declining labor force participation. Rising inequality creates a gap between the growth of average real per-capita income relative to that of median real income, and alternative measures of the evolution of this gap are compared and assessed. Causes of declining productivity growth begin with the slowdown in the rate of increase of educational attainment resulting from the interplay of demand and supply factors, including the flattening of the college wage premium and the rising relative price of college education. Why did productivity growth decline after 2006 despite an increase in the rate at which new U.S. patents were issued in 2006-16 compared to earlier decades? Part of the slowdown is attributed to the maturity of the IT revolution, which also helps to explain the trajectory of the college wage premium. Aspects of the productivity growth slowdown include the declining productivity of research workers, diminishing returns to drug innovation, and the evolutionary rather than revolutionary impact of robots and artificial intelligence, which are replacing workers slowly and only in a minority of industrial sectors throughout the economy. Also considered are alternative explanations of slower productivity growth, including low investment and mismeasurement.},

This hinders the design of believable characters, and the inclusion of NPCs in games that rely heavily on procedural content generation. We have previously addressed this challenge by means of empowerment, a model of intrinsic motivation, and demonstrated how a coupled empowerment maximisation (CEM) policy can yield generic, companion-like behaviour. In this paper, we extend the CEM framework with a minimisation policy to give rise to adversarial behaviour. We conduct a qualitative, exploratory study in a dungeon-crawler game, demonstrating that CEM can exploit the affordances of different content facets in adaptive adversarial behaviour without modifications to the policy. Changes to the level design, underlying mechanics and our character's actions do not threaten our NPC's robustness, but yield new and surprising ways to be mean.},

When the return on investment is equal across individuals, a well-known result is that the two tax systems are equivalent. Motivated by recent empirical evidence documenting persistent heterogeneity in rates of return across individuals, we revisit this question. With such heterogeneity, the two tax systems have opposite implications for both efficiency and inequality. Under capital income taxation, entrepreneurs who are more productive, and therefore generate more income, pay higher taxes. Under wealth taxation, entrepreneurs who have similar wealth levels pay similar taxes regardless of their productivity, which expands the tax base, shifts the tax burden toward unproductive entrepreneurs, and raises the savings rate of productive ones. This reallocation increases aggregate productivity and output. In the simulated model parameterized to match the US data, replacing the capital income tax with a wealth tax in a revenue-neutral fashion delivers a significantly higher average lifetime utility to a newborn (about 7.5 },

 abstract     = {Objective: Effective collaboration between machines and clinicians requires flexible data structures to represent medical processes and clinical practice guidelines. Such a data structure could enable effective turn-taking between human and automated components of a complex treatment, accurate on-line monitoring of clinical treatments (for example to detect medical errors), or automated treatment systems (such as future medical robots) whose overall treatment plan is understandable and auditable by human experts. Materials and Methods: Behavior trees (BTs) emerged from video game development as a graphical language for modeling intelligent agent behavior. BTs have several properties which are attractive for modeling medical procedures including human-readability, authoring tools, and composability. Results: This paper will illustrate construction of BTs for exemplary medical procedures and clinical protocols. Discussion and Conclusion: Behavior Trees thus form a useful, and human authorable/readable bridge between clinical practice guidelines and AI systems.},

We use the revolution in transport technology from the invention of steam railways, newly-constructed spatially- disaggregated data for London from 1801-1921, and a quantitative urban model to provide evidence on the role of these commuting flows in supporting such concentrations of economic activity. Steam railways dramatically reduced travel times and permitted the first large-scale separation of workplace and residence. We show that our model is able to account for the observed changes in the organization of economic activity, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In counterfactuals, we find that removing the entire railway network reduces the population and the value of land and buildings in Greater London by 20 percent or more, and brings down commuting into the City of London from more than 370,000 to less than 60,000 workers.},

 abstract     = {In May 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released the report ``Genetically Engineered Crops: Experiences and Prospects,'' summarizing scientific consensus on genetically engineered crops and their implications. NASEM reports aim to give the public and policymakers information on socially relevant science issues. Their impact, however, is not well understood. This analysis combines national pre- and post-report survey data with a large-scale content analysis of Twitter discussion to examine the report's effect on public perceptions of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We find that the report's release corresponded with reduced negativity in Twitter discourse and increased ambivalence in public risk and benefit perceptions of GMOs, mirroring the NASEM report's conclusions. Surprisingly, this change was most likely for individuals least trusting of scientific studies or university scientists. Our findings indicate that NASEM consensus reports can help shape public discourse, even in, or perhaps because of, the complex information landscape of traditional and social media.},

 abstract     = {Sophisticated attackers find bugs in software, evaluate their exploitability, and then create and launch exploits for bugs found to be exploitable. Most efforts to secure software attempt either to eliminate bugs or to add mitigations that make exploitation more difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new defensive technique called chaff bugs, which instead target the bug discovery and exploit creation stages of this process. Rather than eliminating bugs, we instead add large numbers of bugs that are provably (but not obviously) non-exploitable. Attackers who attempt to find and exploit bugs in software will, with high probability, find an intentionally placed non-exploitable bug and waste precious resources in trying to build a working exploit. We develop two strategies for ensuring non-exploitability and use them to automatically add thousands of non-exploitable bugs to real-world software such as nginx and libFLAC; we show that the functionality of the software is not harmed and demonstrate that our bugs look exploitable to current triage tools. We believe that chaff bugs can serve as an effective deterrent against both human attackers and automated Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRSes).},

 abstract     = {Music relies heavily on repetition to build structure and meaning. Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure. The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention, has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important. Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018). This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity is quadratic in the sequence length. We propose an algorithm that reduces the intermediate memory requirements to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate minute-long (thousands of steps) compositions with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies. We evaluate the Transformer with our relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and Piano-e-competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.},

For a sample of U.S. firms between 1999 and 2013, we find strong support for this strategic complementarity between board independence and the information value of CSR. Our results highlight a novel rationale for CSR - the information motive.},

Results across three experiments are striking: we find consistent evidence that dystopian narratives enhance the willingness to justify radical-especially violent-forms of political action. Yet we find no evidence for the conventional wisdom that they reduce political trust and efficacy, illustrating that fiction's effects may not be what they seem and underscoring the need for political scientists to take fiction seriously.},

Smart cities are required to engage with local communities by promoting a user-centred approach to deal with urban life issues and ultimately enhance people's quality of life. Soundscape promotes a similar approach, based on individuals' perception of acoustic environments. This paper aims to establish a model to implement soundscape maps for the monitoring and management of the acoustic environment and to demonstrate its feasibility. The final objective of the model is to generate visual maps related to perceptual attributes (e.g. 'calm', 'pleasant'), starting from audio recordings of everyday acoustic environments. The proposed model relies on three main stages: (1) sound sources recognition and profiling, (2) prediction of the soundscape's perceptual attributes and (3) implementation of soundscape maps. This research particularly explores the two latter phases, for which a set of sub-processes and methods is proposed and discussed. An accuracy analysis was performed with satisfactory results: the prediction models of the second stage explained up to the 57.5 },

In this paper, we argue that existing urban development are already adaptive and incremental. Given this flexibility in urban development, understanding changes in the so-called 'rules of the game' which structure and change collective action, is increasingly relevant. Gaining such insights advances the ability of planners to deal with perceived spatial problems. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, to develop an analytical framework for scrutinizing changes in rules in incremental urban developments and second, to test the analytical framework in a real-life incremental urban development. Building on Ostrom's IAD Framework we develop an analytical framework that makes a distinction between formal and informal rules, connects sets of rules, actors and interaction patterns and provides a comparative, longitudinal perspective. The case of the Navy Yard in Amsterdam, the Netherlands is used in order to test the framework's application, proving the relevance of investigating how rules in urban development change.},

 abstract     = {The recovery from the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-09 has been sluggish in the United States and more so in a number of other developed countries. This has given rise to a literature about possible secular stagnation (Gordon 2012, 2014; Krugman 2014; Summers 2014; Ball, DeLong, and Summers 2014; and Ball 2014). This paper proposes an approach to explaining the current stagnation that differs from that found in the above literature. We will argue that the current stagnation stems from the effect of the institutional structure of the economy on long-run macroeconomic performance. This explanation for the current stagnation is based on the social structure of accumulation (SSA) theory (Gordon, 1980; Gordon, Edwards, and Reich, 1982, chapter 2; Kotz et al 1994; and McDonough et al, 2010), which is explained below.},

Amid hopes that AI can bring forth ``global good'' there is evidence that some AI systems are already violating fundamental rights and freedoms. As stakeholders look for a North Star to guide AI development, we can rely on human rights to help chart the course ahead. International human rights are a powerful tool for identifying, preventing , and redressing an important class of risks and harms. A human rights-based frame could provide those developing AI with the aspirational, normative, and legal guidance to uphold human dignity and the inherent worth of every individual regardless of country or jurisdiction. Simply put: In order for AI to benefit the common good, at the very least its design and deployment should avoid harms to fundamental human values. International human rights provide a robust and global formulation of those values. This report is intended as a resource for anyone working in the field of AI and gover-nance. It is also intended for those in the human rights field, outlining why they should be concerned about the present-day impacts of AI. What follows translates between},

 abstract     = {The beginning of the Anthropocene has been inconclusively debated. Usually, its starting point is linked to the moment in which some measurable human physical impact, such as global carbon dioxide emissions, increased in an unprecedented manner. However, to grasp the fact that mankind became at some point the major change agent of the earth system it is important to identify how and when humans began to perceive their role as that of an active creator, capable of dominating and changing nature. Although no monocausal explanation exists, I argue that the invention of linear perspective in fifteenth-century Renaissance Italy was a major trigger. Linear perspective changed the way humans saw and interpreted the world around them. It fostered an anthropocentric worldview that placed humans in control of their physical environment, allowed the advancement of scientific methods and the ultimate disenchantment of the physical world. Linear perspective marks the beginning of the 'Anthroposeen' without which the Anthropocene would not have manifested itself in the accelerated way it has. This holds important lessons. It reminds us that to understand the nature of the Anthropocene, we have to understand the parameters that made us think, see and ultimately act the way we do.},

Much like the negative eugenics strategies directed at people of color, Indigenous people, those with a history of incarceration and people with disabilities (among others), trans people have had their reproduction restricted under the guise of doing what is in the best interest of children. This article demonstrates how historical eugenic logics concerned with normative notions of sex, gender and sexuality linger in the laws regarding trans people's legal gender recognition.

 abstract     = {Choice poetics is a formalist framework that seeks to concretely describe the impacts choices have on player experiences within narrative games. Developed in part to support algorithmic generation of narrative choices, the theory includes a detailed analytical framework for understanding the impressions choice structures make by analyzing the relationships among options, outcomes, and player goals. The theory also emphasizes the need to account for players' various modes of engagement, which vary both during play and between players. In this work, we illustrate the non-computational application of choice poetics to the analysis of two different games to further develop the theory and make it more accessible to others. We focus first on using choice poetics to examine the central repeated choice in ``Undertale,'' and show how it can be used to contrast two different player types that will approach a choice differently. Finally, we give an example of fine-grained analysis using a choice from the game ``Papers, Please,'' which breaks down options and their outcomes to illustrate exactly how the choice pushes players towards complicity via the introduction of uncertainty. Through all of these examples, we hope to show the usefulness of choice poetics as a framework for understanding narrative choices, and to demonstrate concretely how one could productively apply it to choices ''in the wild.''},

Model matching explains and predicts individuals' outcomes related to gameplay by focusing on the interrelationships among games' systems of mechanics, relevant situations external to the game, and players' mental models. Formalizing model matching theory in this way provides researchers a unified explanation for game-based learning, game performance, and related gameplay outcomes while also providing a theory-based direction for advancing the study of games more broadly. The propositions explicated in this article are intended to serve as the primary tenets of model matching theory. Considerations for how these propositions may be tested in future games studies research are discussed.},

To accomplish these goals, we recommend that journals adopt common and transparent standards for authorship, outline responsibilities for corresponding authors, adopt the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) (docs.casrai.org/CRediT) methodology for attributing contributions, include this information in article metadata, and require authors to use the ORCID persistent digital identifier (https://orcid.org). Additionally, we recommend that universities and research institutions articulate expectations about author roles and responsibilities to provide a point of common understanding for discussion of authorship across research teams. Furthermore, we propose that funding agencies adopt the ORCID identifier and accept the CRediT taxonomy. We encourage scientific societies to further authorship transparency by signing on to these recommendations and promoting them through their meetings and publications programs.},

As the production of the cloth required less quantity of labour in Portugal, it has been commonly inferred that this country had a production cost advantage over England in cloth making. The paper proves this inference wrong by showing that the English cloth had a lower cost of production, in money, than the Portuguese cloth. This novel interpretation of the numerical example also reveals that Ricardo deployed there the very same rule for specialisation as Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations, rebutting the widespread belief that he had formulated a new law, principle or rule for international specialisation, known as comparative advantage. Thus, the popular contraposition of Smith's absolute versus Ricardo's comparative cost advantage has to be dismissed.},

 abstract     = {The event known as \#GamerGate (GG) emphasized the need to take the study of game culture seriously and pursue it across several platforms. It demonstrated how seemingly ephemeral media created echo chambers of anger, and how the outbursts of hypermasculine aggression exemplified by hooligans also can connect to games and play. Starting from how GG gained popular attention, this article outlines and discusses the nature of GG, the relation to the victims, the sense of victimization among the participants, and how it may have been provoked by the long-standing, general disregard of games as a culture and a cultural artifact of value. It discusses GG as a swarm using this metaphor to describe its self-organizing nature. Further comparing GG to hooligans, this article also introduces a class and marginalization aspect to understanding the event, opening up for discourses that complicates the image of game culture as mainly a culture of isolated consumption.},

Using data on the universe of English school students, we exploit naturally occurring differences in achievement distributions across primary school classes to estimate the impact of class rank conditional on relative achievement. We find large effects on test scores, confidence and subject choice during secondary school, where students have a new set of peers and teachers who are unaware of the students' prior ranking. The effects are especially large for boys, contributing to an observed gender gap in end-of-high school STEM subject choices. Using a basic model of student effort allocation across subjects, we derive and test a hypothesis to distinguish between learning and non-cognitive skills mechanisms and find support for the latter.},

Using state corporate tax rate changes as a setting, we show that cutting state corporate tax rates leads to increases in income inequality. This result is robust to using regression and matching approaches, and to controlling for a host of potential confounders. Contrary to the effects of tax cuts, we find no effects of tax increases on income inequality at the state level. We then use data from the IRS Statistics of Income to explore the mechanism behind the rise in income inequality. We fi nd tax cuts lead to higher reported capital income and a decrease in wage and salary income. These effects are concentrated among top earners, and we fi nd no effects for those reporting less than \$200,000 in income. This result provides evidence that one mechanism for the relation between tax cuts and inequality is that wealthy individuals shift their income to reduce taxes while others do not. Finally, we explore the effects of corporate tax cuts on capital investment using data from the Annual Survey of Manufactures. We find that tax cuts lead to an increase in real investment, suggesting a trade-off between investment and inequality at the state level.},

 abstract     = {We propose a tensor neural network (\$t\$-NN) framework that offers an exciting new paradigm for designing neural networks with multidimensional (tensor) data. Our network architecture is based on the \$t\$-product (Kilmer and Martin, 2011), an algebraic formulation to multiply tensors via circulant convolution. In this \$t\$-product algebra, we interpret tensors as \$t\$-linear operators analogous to matrices as linear operators, and hence our framework inherits mimetic matrix properties. To exemplify the elegant, matrix-mimetic algebraic structure of our \$t\$-NNs, we expand on recent work (Haber and Ruthotto, 2017) which interprets deep neural networks as discretizations of non-linear differential equations and introduces stable neural networks which promote superior generalization. Motivated by this dynamic framework, we introduce a stable \$t\$-NN which facilitates more rapid learning because of its reduced, more powerful parameterization. Through our high-dimensional design, we create a more compact parameter space and extract multidimensional correlations otherwise latent in traditional algorithms. We further generalize our \$t\$-NN framework to a family of tensor-tensor products (Kernfeld, Kilmer, and Aeron, 2015) which still induce a matrix-mimetic algebraic structure. Through numerical experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate the more powerful parameterizations and improved generalizability of stable \$t\$-NNs.},

The ``DReAM'' (Dynamic Reconfigurable Architecture Modeling) framework, has been designed for modeling reconfigurable dynamic systems. It provides a rule-based language, inspired from Interaction Logic, which is expressive and easy to use encompassing all aspects of dynamicity including parametric multi-modal coordination with creation/deletion of components as well as mobility. Additionally, it allows the description of both endogenous/modular and exogenous/centralized coordination styles and sound transformations from one style to the other. The DReAM framework is implemented in the form of a Java API bundled with an execution engine. It allows to develop runnable systems combining the expressiveness of the rule-based notation together with the flexibility of this widespread programming language.},

It has been suggested that our reliance on online technologies such as search engines and social media may limit exposure to diverse points of view and make us vulnerable to manipulation by disinformation. In this paper, we mine a massive dataset of Web traffic to quantify two kinds of bias: (i) homogeneity bias, which is the tendency to consume content from a narrow set of information sources, and (ii) popularity bias, which is the selective exposure to content from top sites. Our analysis reveals different bias levels across several widely used Web platforms. Search exposes users to a diverse set of sources, while social media traffic tends to exhibit high popularity and homogeneity bias. When we focus our analysis on traffic to news sites, we find higher levels of popularity bias, with smaller differences across applications. Overall, our results quantify the extent to which our choices of online systems confine us inside ``social bubbles.''},

In this paper, we provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of the effects of incarceration on prisoners' children and siblings in the United States. We leverage the random assignment of cases to judges in Ohio as a source of exogenous variation in in- carceration, and use linked administrative data to measure outcomes for family members. In contrast to most existing work, we find that incarceration reduces criminal involve- ment among the children and siblings of prisoners. Parental incarceration decreases the likelihood of juvenile incarceration by 2.3 percentage points (45 percent) and adult in- carceration by 2.6 percentage points (29 percent), with similar estimates for the effect of sibling incarceration. The reductions are concentrated among children from poorer neighborhoods and those who experience maternal rather than paternal incarceration. At the same time, parental incarceration increases rates of teen parenthood and reduces high school graduation rates. We show that these effects are most consistent with expo- sure to incarceration having a specific deterrent effect on child criminal activity, although the stresses associated with parental incarceration simultaneously harm children in other domains. \_We},

 abstract     = {Financial decisions impact our lives, and thus everyone from the regulator to the consumer is interested in fair, sound, and explainable decisions. There is increasing competitive desire and regulatory incentive to deploy AI mindfully within financial services. An important mechanism towards that end is to explain AI decisions to various stakeholders. State-of-the-art explainable AI systems mostly serve AI engineers and offer little to no value to business decision makers, customers, and other stakeholders. Towards addressing this gap, in this work we consider the scenario of explaining loan denials. We build the first-of-its-kind dataset that is representative of loan-applicant friendly explanations. We design a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can accommodate smaller datasets, to generate user-friendly textual explanations. We demonstrate how our system can also generate explanations serving different purposes: those that help educate the loan applicants, or help them take appropriate action towards a future approval. We hope that our contributions will aid the deployment of AI in financial services by serving the needs of the wider community of users seeking explanations.},

However, there are cases where pro-social behavior within a community seems, to the contrary, to cause inefficiencies and suboptimal collective outcomes. An explanation for this is that individuals in a society are of different types and their type determines the norm of fairness they adopt. Not all such norms are bound to be beneficial at the societal level. When individuals of different types meet a clash of norms can arise. This, in turn, can determine an advantage for the    ldquo;wrong   rdquo; type. We show this by a game-theoretic analysis in a very simple setting. To test this result - as well as its possible remedies - we also devise a specific simulation model. Our model is written in NETLOGO and is a first attempt to study our problem within an artificial environment that simulates the evolution of a society over time.},

Us-ing administrative data, lab and field experiments to measure outcomes, I find that having poor classmates makes rich students (i) more prosocial, generous and egali-tarian; and (ii) less likely to discriminate against poor students, and more willing to socialize with them. These effects are driven by personal interactions between rich and poor students. In contrast, I find mixed but overall modest impacts on rich students' academic achievement.},

 abstract     = {Taxes change behavior. But how does this change arise? In traditional economic models, change is achieved through the price channel: assuming all else is held constant, taxes increase prices and thus decrease demand. However, the assumption that all else is held constant may be violated in the course of a legal change, in part because the process by which laws are changed often involves the provision of information, attempts at persuasion, and the deployment of alternative dissuasive tools. We examine violations of this assumption in a particular policy domain: discouraging smoking with cigarette taxes. We document a marked increase in related media coverage, lobbying efforts, place-based smoking restrictions, and anti-smoking appropriations in the time period surrounding a tax law change. The intensity of these factors is directly associated with decreases in cigarette consumption in a manner that could be confused with price effects. Our results suggest that price effects may have a surprisingly small role in the behavioral response that occurs around tax law changes.},

Using Gamergate as an example, this article argues that explanations of online abuse that focus on its cultural or technological dimensions fail to capture the mediating role of online platforms in facilitating and rationalizing harassment and reputational damage. The concept of technological rationality pulls into focus the shared logics that shape platform design and administration as well as practices of online abuse. Proposed solutions to online abuse that fail to address technological rationality will ultimately leave in place the sociotechnical arrangements that make such abuse possible and impactful.},

Through 27 articles, we find that animation techniques improves individual's interaction with robots, improving individual's perception of qualities of a robot, understanding what a robot intends to do, and showing the robot's state, or possible emotion. Animation techniques also help people relate to robots that do not resemble a human or robot. The studies in the articles show further areas for research, such as applying animation principles in other types of robots and situations, combining animation techniques with other modalities, and testing robots moving with animation techniques over the long term.},

This article, drawing on fieldwork with developers of recommender systems in the US, describes a tendency among these systems' makers to describe their purpose as ``hooking'' people-enticing them into frequent or enduring usage. Inspired by steady references to capture in the field, I consider recommender systems as traps, drawing on anthropological theories about animal trapping. I chart the rise of ``captivation metrics''-measures of user retention-enabled by a set of transformations in recommenders' epistemic, economic, and technical contexts. Traps prove useful for thinking about how such systems relate to broader infrastructural ecologies of knowledge and technology. As recommenders spread across online cultural infrastructures and become practically inescapable, thinking with traps offers an alternative to common ethical framings that oppose tropes of freedom and coercion.},

 abstract     = {There are multiple theories regarding how institutions change over time, but institutional change is often difficult to study and understand in practice. Agent-based modeling is known as a technique to explore emergent phenomena resulting from the micro level activities and interactions between heterogeneous agents and between agents and the environment. Such models allow researchers to investigate theories which may otherwise be difficult to examine. We present a theoretically driven agent-based model to explore two perspectives on institutional change, rational choice and cultural diffusion, in the context of invasive plant management in Chitwan, Nepal. The Chitwan region is grappling with the spread of the invasive mile-a-minute weed, Mikania micrantha (Mikania). We focus on understanding which perspective of institutional change better fits empirical survey data on Mikania management. We find that rational choice is an unlikely candidate for institutional change in Chitwan and that the social learning and imitation mechanism modeled in the cultural diffusion perspective better replicates empirical patterns. Additionally, the model reveals that the percentage of agents adopting the best practice removal method is not as influential in reducing Mikania as the initial amount of Mikania removed. This result indicates that it may be useful to conduct an empirical assessment varying the initial amount of Mikania removed to understand the management implications for successful removal of Mikania in Chitwan and elsewhere.},

In this paper, we consider agents in an asynchronous, unreliable and time-varying directed network that aim at cooperatively solving submodular minimization problems in a fully distributed way. The challenge is that the (submodular) objective set-function is only partially known by agents, that is, each one is able to evaluate the function only for subsets including itself. We propose a distributed algorithm based on a proper linear programming reformulation of the combinatorial problem. Our algorithm builds on a column generation approach in which each agent maintains a local candidate basis and locally generates columns with a suitable greedy inner routine. A key interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is that the pricing problem, which involves an exponential number of constraints, is solved by the agents through a polynomial time greedy algorithm. We prove that the proposed distributed algorithm converges in finite time to an optimal solution of the submodular minimization problem and we corroborate the theoretical results by performing numerical computations on instances of the \$s\$--\$t\$ minimum graph cut problem.},

Relying on a new method for conceptualizing forms and modes of participation we show that a large variety of creative, expressive, individualized, and digitally enabled forms of participation can be classified as parts of the repertoire of political participation. Results from an innovative survey with a representative sample of the German population demonstrate that old and new forms are systematically integrated into a multi-dimensional taxonomy covering (1) voting, (2) digitally networked participation, (3) institutionalized participation, (4) protest, (5) civic participation, and (6) consumerist participation. Furthermore, the antecedents of consumerist, civic, and digitally networked participation, are very similar to those of older modes of participation such as protest and institutionalized participation. Whereas creative, expressive, and individualized modes appear to be expansions of protest activities, digitally networked forms clearly establish a new and distinct mode of political participation that fits in the general repertoire of political participation.},

For media anthropology and related fields, such as digital and visual anthropology, it is of particular interest how people engage with digital media and technologies; how digital devices and tools are integrated and embedded in everyday life; and how they are entangled with different social practices and cultural processes. The digital turn in media anthropology signals the growing importance of digital media technologies in contemporary sociocultural, political and economic processes. This panel suggested that the digital turn could be seen a paradigm shift in the anthropological study of media, and foregrounded three important streams of exploration that might indicate new directions in the anthropology of media. More and more aspects of people's everyday life and their lived experiences are mediated by digital technologies. Playing, learning, dating, loving, migrating, dying, as well as friendship, kinship, politics, and news production and consumption, have been affected by the diffusion of digital technologies. We often hear far-reaching statements about these transformations, such as euphoric pronouncements about digital media as a radical enabler of grassroots democracy. Yet, new forms of exclusion enacted via digital circulation and online extreme speech need anthropological attention, 1},

 abstract     = {Where do new research questions come from? This is at best only partially taught in courses or textbooks about clinical or epidemiological research. Methods are taught under the assumption that a researcher already knows the research question and knows which methods will fit that question. Similarly, the real complexity of the thought processes that lead to a scientific undertaking is almost never described in published papers. In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by ``cultivating your thoughts''. Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be ``pruned''. Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables. Then you are ready to carry out your research.},

In this work, we present a Wave Oriented Swarm Programming Paradigm (WOSPP) enabling the control of swarms with minimalistic communication bandwidth in a simple manner, yet allowing the emergence of diverse complex behaviors and autonomy of the swarm. Communi cation in the proposed paradigm is based on ``ping''-signals inspired by strategies for communication and self organization of slime mold (dictyostelium discoideum) and fireflies (lampyridae). Signals propagate as information-waves throughout the swarm. We show that even with 1-bit bandwidth communication between agents suffices for the design of a substantial set of behaviors in the domain of essential behaviors of a collective. Ultimately, the reader will be enabled to develop and design a control scheme for individual swarms.},

Agent's choices are based on a logit function and gradual decay of memories of past profits. Numerical simulations demonstrate the stability of various dynamical regimes, such as disorder, fairness or inequity, according to parameters and initial conditions. When playing the game on a lattice i.e. using neighbouring agent interactions instead of random interaction among the whole agent population, one observes spatial domains and specific patterns in addition to the temporal convergence toward attractors observed when interactions involve any pair of agents. A result specific to the network topology is the co-existence of domains with different regimes, allowing the emergence of the inequity condition even in the absence of tags.},

They adapt to the incoming signal, quantify uncertainty, and measure correlation between the signal's amplitude and phase information, making time domain resynthesis straightforward. However, these models are still not widely used since they come at a high computational cost, and because they are formulated in such a way that it can be difficult to interpret all the modelling assumptions. By showing their equivalence to Spectral Mixture Gaussian processes, we illuminate the underlying model assumptions and provide a general framework for constructing more complex models that better approximate real-world signals. Our interpretation makes it intuitive to inspect, compare, and alter the models since all prior knowledge is encoded in the Gaussian process kernel functions. We utilise a state space representation to perform efficient inference via Kalman smoothing, and we demonstrate how our interpretation allows for efficient parameter learning in the frequency domain.},
