  abstract  = {This article will attempt an original interpretation of Capital (Marx, K. 1867. Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol. 1. Marx/Engels Internet Archive, 1995, 1999. http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx) and other major works of Karl Marx to demonstrate that people of African descent are central to the discourse of Marx, contrary to widespread misconceptions by critics who attribute a Eurocentric orientation to Marx because of the accident of his birth in Europe and by allies because of his scholarly activism in European working-class politics. The paper argues that the earlier work of Marx and Engels ([1847] 1969. The Manifesto of the Communist Party in Marx/Engels Selected Works, Vol. One, pp. 98-137. Moscow: Progress Publishers), especially the Manifesto of the Communist Party, may have misled critics into believing that the history of all hitherto existing society alluded to by Marx and Engels was exclusively European history. On the contrary, there are hundreds of references to the 'Negro' in Capital, not as part of a peripheral or superficial concern relating to the issue of class exploitation in Europe, but as a foundational model for explaining and predicting the ending of the exploitation of the working class globally. The paper concludes that this reading adds credence to Africana Studies paradigms that privilege critical, Africa-centred scholar-activism as an important contribution to original theoretical, methodological and policy innovations. © 2014 © 2014 ROAPE Publications Ltd.},

A large number of agent decision making models can be found in the literature, each inspired by different aims and research questions. In this paper we provide a review of 14 agent decision making architectures that have attracted interest. They range from production-rule systems to psychologically- and neurologically-inspired approaches. For each of the architectures we give an overview of its design, highlight research questions that have been answered with its help and outline the reasons for the choice of the decision making model provided by the originators. Our goal is to provide guidelines about what kind of agent decision making model, with which level of simplicity or complexity, to use for which kind of research question. },

The theoretical and practical challenge we face is twofold. On the one hand, we want to explain what generates and supports such practices. On the other, we want to find ways to change them permanently. We will argue here that social norms play an important role in both tasks. Often norms support or embed certain practices, so that eliminating the latter involves changing the former. Sometimes, however, norms have to be created in order to eliminate a negative practice and support a new one, as we know of several widely practiced behaviors that are not supported by norms, but can be changed by introducing them. To understand what we mean by 'practice' and 'norm', we shall next refer to Bicchieri (2006) definition of social norms, a definition that allows to shed light on the way norms are supported, and on ways we may act to change them.},

  abstract = {The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area of research, but little attention has been given to how social and ecological interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly relevant to the South African water sector, where a major policy transition is occurring that provides local water users and managers with new opportunities to engage in adaptive learning about how to balance human and ecological needs for water. In this paper, an agent-based model is used to explore potential &lsquo;learning dilemmas,&rsquo; or barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby human perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents manage water according to different management strategies and use various indicators to evaluate their success. The model shows that in areas with highly variable hydrological regimes, agents may be less able to learn because conditions are too unpredictable for them to benefit from past experience. Because of these changing conditions, however, agents are more likely to try new water management strategies, promoting a greater diversity of experience in the system for agents to learn from in the future. In water-stressed areas, where agents tend to have greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in areas with abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new strategies. When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or more heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance learning so that it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological, and social dynamics. Although the model is a highly stylised version of reality, this preliminary exploration may eventually help to reverse the past trend of poor understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they relate to water management.},

In this eye-opening book, youth culture and technology expert danah boyd uncovers some of the major myths regarding teens' use of social media. She explores tropes about identity, privacy, safety, danger and bullying. Ultimately, boyd argues that society fails young people when paternalism and protectionism hinder teenagers' ability to become informed, thoughtful and engaged citizens through their online interactions. Yet despite an environment of rampant fear-mongering, boyd finds that teens often find ways to engage and to develop a sense of identity. boyd's conclusions are essential reading not only for parents, teachers and others who work with teens, but also for anyone interested in the impact of emerging technologies on society, culture and commerce in years to come. Offering insights gleaned from more than a decade of original fieldwork interviewing teenagers across the United States, boyd concludes reassuringly that the kids are all right. At the same time, she acknowledges that coming to terms with life in a networked era is not easy or obvious. In a technologically mediated world, life is bound to be complicated.},

  abstract = {If artificial intelligence (AI) were achievable, what would the conse-quences be for human society? 1 Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is already at hand. We are achieving rapid and accelerating success in our quest to build AI. That very success - and the slowness with which both the academic community and the general public have come to recognise it - has shown how lit-tle we understand our own intelligence, and its role in our lives and culture. Here I attempt to address this problem of understanding, exploiting a variety of scientific evidence, including social simulation. I begin by reviewing current progress in AI, which is profound but underestimated. I suggest this lack of recognition is due to the mistaken belief that intelligence implies agency. I next examine the related question of human uniqueness: why do only we have language and extensive built culture? I use models and data to show that the propensities to use culture, share information and behave altruistically are neither unique to humans nor inexplicable to biology, but rather our uniqueness hinges on the extent of our capacities for communication and memory. Finally, I apply the impact of AI on extending our intelligence to these theories, to predict-and observe-consequences of AI on human societies and in-dividual human lives. I make and support policy recommendations based on these predictions.},

In particular, I will argue that these artifacts specify (predict and prescribe) the mental contents of the participants, both in terms of beliefs and acceptances and in terms of motives and plans. We have to revise the behavioristic view of "scripts" and "roles"; when we play a role we wear a "mind." No collective action would be possible without shared and/or ascribed mental contents. This is also very crucial for a central form of automatic mind-reading (mind ascription). Second, I will argue that often what really matters is the ascribed/prescribed, worn, mind not the real, private one. We have to play (like in the symbolic play) "as if" we had those mental contents. This social convention and mutual assumption makes the interaction work. The ascribed beliefs and goals are not necessarily explicitly there; they might be just implicit as inactive (we act just by routine and automatically) or implicit as potential. The coordination and social action works thanks to these "as if" (ascribed and pretended) minds, thanks to those conventional constructs. Our social minds for social interactions are coordination artifacts and social institutions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

  abstract  = {© 2015 The Authors. Background: Histological analysis of the cochlea is required to understand the physiological and pathological processes in the inner ear. In the past, many embedding techniques have been tested in the cochlea to find an optimal protocol that gives both good morphological and immunohistochemical results. Resins provide high quality cochlear morphology with reduced immunogenicity due to the higher polymerization temperature. New method: We used Technovit 9100 New ® , a low temperature embedding system based on methyl methacrylate, on adult guinea pig and mouse cochleae to evaluate preservation of the morphology and maintenance of the antigenicity. Results: Conventional toluidine blue staining, as well as immunohistochemical staining with a set of commonly used antibodies, showed highly preserved morphology and immunogenicity of decalcified adult guinea pig and mouse cochleae. Comparison with existing method(s): We demonstrate both, well-preserved morphology and preservation of antigenicity, superior to other embedding techniques. Conclusions: Our results showed that the Technovit 9100 New ® embedding system provided highly preserved morphology and immunogenicity with our protocol in adult guinea pig and mouse cochleae.},

In this paper, we formalize and analyze the reasons behind the success of the BTs using standard tools of robot control theory, focusing on how properties such as robustness and safety are addressed in a modular way. In particular, we show how these key properties can be traced back to the ideas of subsumption and sequential compositions of robot behaviors. Thus BTs can be seen as a recent addition to a long research effort towards increasing modularity, robustness and safety of robot control software. To illustrate the use of BTs, we provide a set of solutions to example problems.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a mathematical framework for performance analysis of Behavior Trees (BTs). BTs are a recent alternative to Finite State Machines (FSMs), for doing modular task switching in robot control architectures. By encoding the switching logic in a tree structure, instead of distributing it in the states of a FSM, modularity and reusability are improved. In this paper, we compute performance measures, such as success/failure probabilities and execution times, for plans encoded and executed by BTs. To do this, we first introduce Stochastic Behavior Trees (SBT), where we assume that the probabilistic performance measures of the basic action controllers are given. We then show how Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) can be used to aggregate these measures from one level of the tree to the next. The recursive structure of the tree then enables us to step by step propagate such estimates from the leaves (basic action controllers) to the root (complete task execution). Finally, we verify our analytical results using massive Monte Carlo simulations, and provide an illustrative example of the results for a complex robotic task.},

It focuses on the creativity of the movement, which ranges from semantic innovations (such as peasant seeds) to the reinvention of onfarm breeding practices based on new scientific paradigms, and includes new alliances with the social movements defending the commons. The trajectory of the movement is shaped by its encounters-with scientists, other international seed contestations, and other social movements-and by the productive frictions they create. This in-depth reframing of the activities connected to seeds contributes to building a counternarrative about farmers and seeds that reopens spaces for contestation. In this counternarrative, peasant seeds play a central and subversive role in the sense that they question the ontological assumptions of present seed laws. © Stichting Focaal and Berghahn Books.},

Just like agents, organizations should also be able to adapt themselves to changing environments. In order to develop a theory of how this reorganization should be performed we need a formal framework in which organizations, organizational performance and the reorganization itself can be described. In this article, we present a formal description of reorganization actions in Logic forAgent Organization. We show how this formalization can support the preservation of some nice properties of organizations while it can also be used to reason about which reorganization is needed to achieve some basic organizational properties.

Variable capture occurs when in the generated program a variable declaration accidentally shadows the intended target of a variable reference. Existing transformation systems either do not guarantee the avoidance of variable capture or impair the implementation of transformations. We present an algorithm called name-fix that automatically eliminates variable capture from a generated program by systematically renaming variables. name-fix is guided by a graph representation of the binding structure of a program, and requires name-resolution algorithms for the source language and the target language of a transformation. name-fix is generic and works for arbitrary transformations in any transformation system that supports origin tracking for names. We verify the correctness of name-fix and identify an interesting class of transformations for which name-fix provides hygiene. We demonstrate the applicability of name-fix for implementing capture-avoiding substitution, inlining, lambda lifting, and compilers for two domain-specific languages.},

These studies reveal an array of so-called cognitive biases and puzzling features of behaviour that seem irrational in the specific situation presented to the decision-maker. Here we review an emerging body of work that highlights spatiotemporal heterogeneity and autocorrelation as key properties of most real-world environments that may help us understand why these biases evolved. Ecologically rational decision rules adapted to such environments can lead to apparently maladaptive behaviour in artificial experimental settings. We encourage researchers to consider environments with greater complexity to understand better how evolution has shaped our cognitive systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, most such conversational in-teractions in videogames are quite limited in how they take into account the identities of those characters. Conversa-tion in videogames typically varies, if at all, based only on one aspect of the character such as a non-player character (NPC) referring to the character by race, class, or a gendered pronoun. In this paper, we present an approach to devel-oping conversational narratives that addresses such limita-tions. Toward this end, we present the Chimeria platform, which uses a cognitive science-grounded model of social cat-egory membership to customize how conversational narra-tives unfold. We also present a playable interactive con-versational scenario called " Chimeria:Gatekeeper " authored using the Chimeria Platform. This scenario demonstrates how the system considers multiple aspects of a character's identity and degree of membership with, and between, social group categories in generating conversational dialog between a player character (PC) and an NPC. Using this scenario we illustrate how our approach allows the construction of con-versational narratives that convey social identity phenomena such as stigma and discrimination.},

We introduce two novel features in the language of propositional dynamic logic, converse as backwards modality and abstract processes specified by preconditions and effects, written as $ϕ$ ⇒ $ψ$ and first explored in our recent paper (Hartonas, Log J IGPL Oxf Univ Press, 2012), where a Gentzen-style sequent calculus was introduced. The system has two very natural interpretations, one based on the familiar relational semantics and the other based on type semantics, where action terms are interpreted as types of actions (sets of binary relations). We show that the proof systems do not distinguish between the two kinds of semantics, by completeness arguments. Converse as backwards modality together with action types allow us to produce a new purely equational axiomatization of Dynamic Algebras, where iteration is axiomatized independently of box and where the fixpoint and Segerberg induction axioms are derivable. The system also includes capabilities operators and our results provide then a finitary Hilbert-style axiomatization and a decidable system for reasoning about agent capabilities, missing in the KARO framework. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract  = {Software translation is a challenging task. Several requirements are important-including automation of the execution, maintainability of the translation patterns, and, most importantly, reliability concerning the correctness of the translation. Triple graph grammars (TGGs) have shown to be an intuitive, well-defined technique for model translation. In this paper, we leverage TGGs for industry scale software translations. The approach is implemented using the Eclipse-based graph transformation tool Henshin and has been successfully applied in a large industrial project with the satellite operator SES on the translation of satellite control procedures. We evaluate the approach regarding requirements from the project and performance on a complete set of procedures of one satellite. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

This has interesting and important implications for designers of open, self-organising, rule-based systems, if our concern is to ensure that the system should operate within a 'corridor' of behavior, or should avoid certain non-normative states. To investigate this issue, this paper presents the preliminary design, implementation and operation of a self-organising multi-agent system in which the agents play the Game of Nomic. While not yet in a position to test Suber's hypothesis fully, we can see how different agent strategies can reason, reflect, and make decisions that benefit their internal objectives relative to the game itself, by using an awareness of themselves, other players, the ruleset and the projected outcome of proposed rule modifications. © 2013 IEEE.},

Social practice theories provide an integrated approach to understanding consumer behaviour. The mechanisms underlying the emergence and diffusion of social practices are however until now poorly understood. This paper presents a conceptual framework and an abstract agent-based simulation model for generating social practices which use and extend approaches from social practice theories. The main results are twofold. First, the simulation model is able to generate social practices, what confirms that the conceptual framework captures relevant elements and processes. Second, a new mechanism for behavioural lock-in is identified that provides additional insights into the widely acknowledged challenge of changing social practices and respective consumption. },

This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect - imagined contact reducing prejudice - showed weak support for replicability. And two effects - flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification - did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.},

  abstract = {Computer code is a form of notational language. It prescribes actions to be carried out by the computer, often by systems called interpreters. When code is used to write music, we are therefore operating with programming language as a relatively new form of musical notation. Music is a time-based art form and the traditional musical score is a linear chronograph with instructions for an interpreter. Here code and traditional notation are somewhat at odds, since code is written as text, without any representational timeline. This can pose problems, for example, for a composer who is working on a section in the middle of a long piece, but has to repeatedly run the code from the beginning or make temporary arrangements to solve this difficulty in the compositional process. In short: code does not come with a timeline, but is rather the material used for building timelines. The context of creating linear code scores in the area of musical notation is explored. The Threnoscope is presented as an example of a system that implements both representational notation and a prescriptive code score.},

This body of work is entitled "The Impact of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space" and was developed in response to a recommendation from the 2011 National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, "Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences for a New Era," which emphasized the need to fully understand sex and gender differences in space. To ensure the health and safety of male and female astronauts during long-duration space missions, it is imperative to examine and understand the influences that sex and gender have on physiological and psychological changes that occur during spaceflight. In this collection of manuscripts, six workgroups investigated and summarized the current body of published and unpublished human and animal research performed to date related to sex- and gender-based differences in the areas of cardiovascular, immunological, sensorimotor, musculoskeletal, reproductive, and behavioral adaptations to human spaceflight. Each workgroup consisted of scientists and clinicians from academia, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other federal agencies and was co-chaired by one representative from NASA and one from the external scientific community. The workgroups met via telephone and e-mail over 6 months to review literature and data from space- and ground-based studies to identify sex and gender factors affecting crew health. In particular, the Life Sciences Data Archive and the Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health were extensively mined. The groups identified certain sex-related differences that impact the risks and the optimal medical care required by space-faring women and men. It represents innovative research in sex and gender-based biology that impacts those individuals that are at the forefront of space exploration.},

CLIPS-R differs from previous theory revision systems in that it operates on forward chaining production systems. Revision of production system rule- bases is important because production systems can perform a variety of tasks such as monitoring and design in addition to classification tasks that have been addressed by previous research. We show that CLIPS-R can take advantage of a va- riety of user specified constraints on the correct processing of instances, such as ordering con- straints on the displaying of information, and the contents of the final fact list. In addition, we show that CLIPS-R can operate as well as exist- ing systems when the only constraint on process- ing an instance is the correct classification of the instance.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for build- ing practical systems. In order to enhance understandabil- ity, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majori- ties to guarantee safety. 1},

There are probably plenty of strong claims about dynamic languages that I'd be skeptical of if I heard them, but I'm not in the right communities to hear the stronger claims about dynamically typed languages.

  abstract  = {Prom Week is a social-simulation videogame driven by the artificial intelligence engine Comme il Faut (CiF). In each level of the game, the player selects social in- teractions between characters in an effort to achieve so- cially oriented goals. These social interactions are en- acted with hand-authored natural-language dialogue ex- changes, called instantiations, which also serve to ren- der the underlying social considerations propelling the narrative at hand. While CiF's merit is in its capacity to richly model a social space, constraints rooted in au- thorial burden hinder Prom Week's ability to fully ren- der CiF's rich social representations. What is needed is more instantiations, specifically instantiations that can render uncommon or complex game states with greater fidelity. We propose a technique to procedu- rally generate new, felicitous instantiations by recom- bination of dialogue segments from existing instan- tiations that are annotated, using the story-encoding tool SCHEHERAZADE, for their transmissions about the story world and their various dependencies.},

  abstract = {Biochemistry, sometimes called biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within, and relating to, living organisms.[1] By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life. Over the last 40 years biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research.[2] Today the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms. Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, the study of the molecular mechanisms by which genetic information encoded in DNA is able to result in the processes of life. Depending on the exact definition of the terms used, molecular biology can be thought of as a branch of biochemistry, or biochemistry as a tool with which to investigate and study molecular biology. Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions. These can be inorganic, for example water and metal ions, or organic, for example the amino acids which are used to synthesise proteins. The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism},

  abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly configurable. While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks, such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory, unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore, every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system's effective configuration space-the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal-could comprise only a tiny subset of the system's full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system's effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system's behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The key improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions-a construct that improves iTree's ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree's running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the similar to 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.},

  abstract = {Forgetting is an important tool for reducing ontologies by eliminating some redundant concepts and roles while preserving sound and complete reasoning. Attempts have previously been made to address the problem of forgetting in relatively simple description logics (DLs), such as DL-Lite and extended . However, the issue of forgetting for ontologies in more expressive DLs, such as and OWL DL, is largely unexplored. In particular, the problem of characterizing and computing forgetting for such logics is still open. In this paper, we first define semantic forgetting about concepts and roles in ontologies and state several important properties of forgetting in this setting. We then define the result of forgetting for concept descriptions in , state the properties of forgetting for concept descriptions, and present algorithms for computing the result of forgetting for concept descriptions. Unlike the case of DL-Lite, the result of forgetting for an ontology does not exist in general, even for the special case of forgetting in TBoxes. This makes the problem of computing the result of forgetting in more challenging. We address this problem by defining a series of approximations to the result of forgetting for ontologies and studying their properties. Our algorithms for computing approximations can be directly implemented as a plug-in of an ontology editor to enhance its ability of managing and reasoning in (large) ontologies.},

In this paper we present the framework of LISSA which is a serious game designed to teach and learn CPR skills. LISSA combines in a single framework computer-based sim-ulations of CPR emergencies with the functionalities of e-learning platforms. Using UML state machine, different emergency scenario can be derived by instructor and pre-sented as problems that the learner has to solve in a game mode. All the actions and all the cases are registered in a database that can be consulted at any moment by the in-structor. LISSA can be used as a substitute or a complement for traditional CPR classroom-based instruction. It can also be used to educate laypersons who might not otherwise be inclined to attend a CPR course. The adaptive learning sup-ported by LISSA makes it suitable to refresh and improve CPR skill retention over time.},

  abstract = {This article examines the informational exchanges between consumers, food activists and small-scale food producers and vendors through the lenses of justice and literacy. Employing participant observations and interviews at food-related events in South Florida, the article offers two contributions to the growing research on food systems: (1) small-scale food producers, farmworkers, vendors and activists are working an additional shift as citizen educators; and (2) farmworker justice and climate change remain neglected and disconnected from food-related concerns. This article argues that consumers, producers and vendors share an interest and a passion for good-tasting, healthy food that starts a conversation. Yet together they minimize or avoid the politicized nature of climate change and the moral problem of farmworker exploitation. Furthermore, the scientifically complex subject of genetic engineering emerged as a concern and point of activism during the course of this research. Together, climate change, labor and genetic engineering remain difficult topics to bring into conversations and into the food community's educational efforts due to the political, moral and scientifically challenging nature of each concern respectively. This work suggests that citizens as consumers would be empowered by a more complete understanding of the food system, including (1) molecular-level changes due to biotechnology; (2) workplace injustices in the fields; and (3) the links between agriculture and climate change-what this article refers to as food system literacy. The absence of food system literacy is a social problem that masks structural inequities and long-term risks, and that discourages or disables identification and discussion of some of the more complicated issues related to the food chain.},

  abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to set out the case for building robots with internal models as a possible route toward achieving a level of functional self-awareness that would usefully extend the capabilities of autonomous robots. The chapter argues that these capabilities will lead to enhanced safety - especially in physical human robot interaction (pHRI) - and, perhaps also, toward ethical behaviour in autonomous robots. Indeed, the chapter will advance the argument that safe and ethical autonomous robots may not be achievable at all without mechanisms for self-awareness. Importantly, the ideas and mechanisms proposed in this chapter are intended to be realisable with current and near-future technology, i.e. using conventional computing platforms embedded within existing or buildable robot bodies, with existing devices for sensing and actuation. Thus, this chapter is primarily about how we might engineer practical self-awareness, for safer (and possibly ethical) robots in the near-term. This chapter will be less concerned with philosophical questions such as whether, or not, such robots are really self-aware, although we will touch upon the question of what behaviour might, if exhibited, be argued as evidence for 'as if' self- awareness.},

As a discipline, multi-criteria decision-making has a relatively short history. Since 1950s and 1960s, when foundations of modern multi-criteria decision-making methods have been laid, many researches devoted their time to development of new multi-criteria decision-making models and techniques. In the past decades, researches and development in the field have accelerated and seem to continue growing exponentially. Despite the intensive development worldwide, few attempts have been made to systematically present the theoretical bases and developments of multi-criteria decision-making methods. However, the methodological choices and framework for assessment of decisions are still under discussion. The article describes the situation with reviews of MCDM/MADM methods.

  abstract = {Routine activity theory states that criminal acts are caused due to the presence of criminals, victims and the absence of guardians in time and place. As the number of collision of these elements in place and time increases, criminal acts will also increase even if the number of criminals or civilians remains the same within the vicinity of a city. Street robbery is a typical example of daily crime and the occurrence of which can be predicted using routine activity theory. Agent-based models allow simulation of diversity among individuals. Therefore agent based simulation of street robbery can be used to visualize how chronological aspects of human activity influence the incidence of street robbery. The conceptual model identifies three classes of people- criminals, civilians and police with certain activity areas for each. Police exist only as agents of formal guardianship. Criminals with a tendency for crime will be in the search for their victims. Civilians without criminal tendency can be either victims or guardians. In addition to criminal tendency, each civilian in the model has a unique set of characteristics like wealth, employment status, ability for guardianship etc. These agents are subjected to random walk through a street environment guided by a Q - learning module and the possible outcomes are analyzed. The results include comparison of gang and single robberies, robberies made on kids and women and comparison of different guardian patrolling strategies.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates and presents approaches towards creating more socially competent NPCs by means of natural language dialogues. The aim is to provide hands-on solutions for game developers who want to offer interactions with the NPCs in the game that are socially driven rather than functionally motivated and that encourage the player to build and maintain relationships between the character they control and the other game characters. By means of gameplay design patterns (GDPs), i.e. a semi-formal means of describing, sharing and expanding knowledge about game design, a selection of games have been analysed in order to identify existing and hypothetical GDPs for game dialogues. The analysis resulted in a number of GDPs that support, or could support, social interaction among game characters. A selection of the identified patterns has then been modelled using Harel statecharts and implemented in State Chart XML, a candidate to become a W3C standard},

  abstract =     {F# brings the power of functional-first programming to the .NET Framework, a platform for developing software in the Microsoft Windows ecosystem. If you&#39;re a traditional .NET developer used to C# and Visual Basic, discovering F# will be a revelation that will change how you code, and how you think about coding.In The Book of F#, Microsoft MVP Dave Fancher shares his expertise and teaches you how to wield the power of F# to write succinct, reliable, and predictable code. As you learn to take advantage of features like default immutability, pipelining, type inference, and pattern matching, you&#39;ll be amazed at how efficient and elegant your code can be.You&#39;ll also learn how to:* Exploit F#&#39;s functional nature using currying, partial application, and delegation* Streamline type creation and safety with record types and discriminated unions* Use collection types and modules to handle data sets more effectively* Use pattern matching to decompose complex types and branch your code within a single expression* Make your software more responsive with parallel programming and asynchronous workflows* Harness object orientation to develop rich frameworks and interact with code written in other .NET languages* Use query expressions and type providers to access and manipulate data sets from disparate sourcesBreak free of that old school of programming. The Book of F# will show you how to unleash the expressiveness of F# to create smarter, leaner code.},

  abstract  = {As an emergent orientation in sociology, criminology, and criminal justice, cultural criminology explores the convergence of cultural and criminal processes in contemporary social life. Drawing on perspectives from cultural studies, postmodern theory, critical theory, and interactionist sociology, and on ethnographic methodologies and media/textual analysis, this orientation highlights issues of image, meaning, and representation in the interplay of crime and crime control. Specifically, cultural criminology investigates the stylized frameworks and experiential dynamics of illicit subcultures; the symbolic criminalization of popular culture forms; and the mediated construction of crime and crime control issues. In addition, emerging areas of inquiry within cultural criminology include the development of situated media and situated audiences for crime; the media and culture of policing; the links between crime, crime control, and cultural space; and the collectively embodied emotions that shape the meaning of crime.},

We defined guidelines to support a DSL developer to achieve better quality of the language design and a better acceptance among its users.},

We put forward a characterisation of these systems and introduce some conceptual distinctions that may help to plot the work ahead. In particular, we propose a tripartite view that highlights the interplay between the institutional models that prescribe the behaviour of participants, the corre- sponding implementation of these prescriptions and the actual performance of the system. Building on this tripartite view we explore the problem of developing a conceptual framework for modelling this type of systems and howthat framework can be supported by technological artefacts that implement the resulting models. The last section of this position paper is a list of challenges that we believe are worth facing. This work draws upon the contributions that the MAS community has made to the understanding and realization of the concepts of coordination, norms and institutions from an organisational perspective.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, financialization has significantly restructured American capitalism. Social scientists have offered several accounts to explain financial markets' ascen-dance, but this work often portrays financialization as a totalizing force and is conducted within divergent theoretical paradigms-political economy and neo-institutionalism- with few attempts to bridge these differences. Accordingly, we risk talking past each other while failing to identify where financialization occurs. I address these issues with a unique panel data set, panel analysis and with a focus on identifying the meso-level determinants of financialization. I do so with a substantively important industry that exemplifies the global, flexible and competitive characteristics of neo-liberal capitalism. I argue that the propensity to financialize rests significantly upon firms' productive roles, meaning we cannot understand financialization without under-standing production-global production networks in particular. This is also a call for researchers to explore financialization's multifaceted character and to develop a more analytically rigorous research agenda.},

  abstract = {Agent-based models are increasingly used to address questions regarding real-world phenomena and mechanisms; therefore, the calibration of model parameters to certain data sets and patterns is often needed. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is an important part of the development and analysis of any simulation model. By exploring the sensitivity of model output to changes in parameters, we learn about the relative importance of the various mechanisms represented in the model and how robust the model output is to parameter uncertainty. These insights foster the understanding of models and their use for theory development and applications. Both steps of the model development cycle require massive repetitions of simulation runs with varying parameter values. To facilitate parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis for agent-based modellers, we show how to use a suite of important established methods. Because NetLogo and R are widely used in agent-based modelling and for statistical analyses, we use a simple model implemented in NetLogo as an example, packages in R that implement the respective methods, and the RNetLogo package, which links R and NetLogo. We briefly introduce each method and provide references for further reading. We then list the packages in R that may be used for implementing the methods, provide short code examples demonstrating how the methods can be applied in R, and present and discuss the corresponding outputs. The Supplementary Material includes full, adaptable code samples for using the presented methods with R and NetLogo. Our overall aim is to make agent-based modellers aware of existing methods and tools for parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis and to provide accessible tools for using these methods. In this way, we hope to contribute to establishing an advanced culture of relating agent-based models to data and patterns observed in real systems and to foster rigorous and structured analyses of agent-based models.},
