  abstract = {The present paper attempts to extend the results of l, in the domain of the propositional calculus, to a class of modal systems called normal. This class includes M and S4 as well as S5; we will also treat a new system, the BROUWER-sche system. In sequels to the present paper, we intend to extend the treatment to non-normal modal propositional calculi (see 7 for an enumeration of the systems included), and to quantificational and identity extensions of all these propositional systems of modal logic (see again 7 for details; but readers of I will have an inkling of how quantificational extensions are to be carried out). Thorough acqua- intance with I is presupposed; and many of the proofs in this paper (which, by reason of the many systems here treated, is occasionally somewhat compressed), are better comprehended by a comparison with the corresponding proofs in l.},
