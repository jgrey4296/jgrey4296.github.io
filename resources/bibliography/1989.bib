By constructivism, I mean that there is a social genesis on the one hand of the patterns of perception, thought and action which are constitutive of what I call the habitus, and on the other hand of social structures, and in particular of what I call fields and groups, especially of what are usually called social classes''},

This article investigates how this mechanism might evolve cooperation in a manner that can overcome the tendency towards defec- tion in human societies. We extend Marks analysis by testing his emu- lation model in a social setting where defection is likely, and we offer new models that more accurately capture the learning process of dispro- portionate prior exposure. Our results suggest that this mechanism can account for some evolution of cooperation, and that its strength is greatly influenced by conditions that alter actors perceptions of the joint distribution of fitness and cooperation. We conclude by discussing how cultural mechanisms like stories and myths may magnify the evolution- ary potential of disproportionate prior exposure in cultural evolution.},

An experimental hybrid tool 1 developed by the authors is described in more detail. Finally the whole idea of hybrid tools is evaluated. 1 Hybrid systems Traditionally AI programs are based on a single methodology, such as frames, rules or logic programming. Furthermore every methodology is claimed to be natural, efficient and uniform. There is, however, strong evidence that no single methodology is appropriate for all applications, and it is believed that naturalness, efficiency and flexibility are all increased by trading uniformity for the power that is provided by combining a small set of different methodologies in the same AI tool /7/. Such 'hybrid' AI tools like ART /1/, KEE /6/ and Loops /10/ have become increasingly popular in the expert system development. Usually a hybrid tool combines some frame based knowledge representat...},
