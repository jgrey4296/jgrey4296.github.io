  abstract  = {Discovering Artificial Economics is an informal introduction to the ideas of modern systems theory and self-organization as they apply to problems in the economic realm. David Batten interleaves anecdotes and stories with technical discussions, in order to provide the general reader with a good feel for how economies function and change. Using a wealth of examples from evolutionary game theory, to stock markets, to urban and traffic planning, Batten shows how economic agents interact to produce the behavior we have come to recognize as economic life. Despite the book's easy-to-read style, Batten's message is quite profound. Strongly interactive groups of agents can produce unexpected collective behavior, emergent features which are lawful in their own right. These patterns of emergent behavior are the hallmark of a complex, self-organizing economy.Batten discards many traditional axioms of economic behavior. Far from displaying perfectly deductive rationality to achieve a predictable economic equilibrium, his agents face an economy that is open and dynamic. There we find evolution, heterogeneity and instabilities; stochastic and deterministic phenomena; unexpected regularities as well as equally unexpected, large-scale fluctuations. Interacting agents are forced to be intuitive and adaptive, because they must respond to a continuously changing economic landscape. Because complexity theory attempts to study a large number of agents, and their changing interaction patterns, it often gets too difficult for a mathematical solution. Thus, many of the anecdotes and results discussed in the book have emerged from agent-based computer simulations. The message is that the social sciences are poised on the verge of a new scientific era, one in which economists will conduct experiments inside their own computers. Welcome to the new age of Artificial Economics.},

  abstract  = {E-markets and negotiation protocols are two types of application domains that can be viewed as open computational societies. Key characteristics of such societies are agent heterogeneity, conflicting individual goals and limited trust. The risk that members of such societies will not conform to specifications imposes the need for a framework that will facilitate the designers to determine to what extent it is desirable to deploy their agents in such societies. We address this need by presenting a formal framework for specifying, animating, and ultimately reasoning about and verifying the properties of open computational systems. We view computational systems from an external perspective, aiming to account for the institutional and social aspects of these systems. We identify the key concepts and illustrate how they are used by formalising an example employing the contract net protocol. The framework and associated logical inferences have been implemented as a software platform that provides automated animation of the global states of an open system (society) during its execution. Simulations have demonstrated that the implementation of the framework establishes a foundation for a rich, formal representation of open computational societies.},

Although the five men were fully consenting adults, the Law Lords held that consent did not constitute a defence to acts of violence within a sado-masochistic context. This paper examines the judgements in this case and argues that sado-masochistic practices are no different from the known exceptions cited by the court to the idea that consent is no defence to violence (sport, parental chastisement and surgery). It also argues that if we can make sense of rape as a non-consensual, violent act, expressed through sex, then we can make sense of sado-masochism as a consensual sexual act, expressed through violence.},

These applications need to be able to recognize patterns involving events. However the RETE algorithm does not provide support for the expression of time-sensitive patterns. This paper proposes an extension of RETE through the concepts of time-stamped events and temporal constraints between events. This allows applications to write rules that process both facts and events.},

Tajfel's paper is important for outlining a social cognitive approach to the study of prejudice and also for refuting of what Tajfel called the 'blood-and-guts' approach. Taking Tajfel's proposition that social psychology is not value-free, the current paper examines the moral and political view of 'Cognitive aspects' and also the gaps in its approach to the study of prejudice. It is suggested that this cognitive approach has difficulty in accounting for extreme bigotry, at least without recourse to the motivational themes that the approach seeks to exclude. In particular, there would be limitations in applying this approach in order to understand the Holocaust. Indeed, Tajfel did not attempt to do so, for reasons that are discussed. Tajfel's Social Identity Theory (SIT) has similar limitations. The paper also examines Tajfel's use of the term 'depersonalization', which he described as a 'milder' form of dehumanization of out-groups. Later social identity theorists have tended to use 'depersonalization' differently, shifting their attention to in-groups. Their perspective moves away from understanding the topic of prejudice in the way that can be found in Tajfel's 'Cognitive aspects of prejudice'. Finally, the present paper suggests how extreme prejudice might be studied without returning to the motivational 'blood-and-guts' approach that Tajfel so cogently criticized.},

  abstract = {The basic aims of truth-conditional semantics are argued to be unaffected by phenomena that have been claimed elsewhere to lead to dynamic theories of semantics, including those of J. Groenendijk \& M. Stokhof, R. C. Stalnaker's (1979) account of discourse, \& the dynamic metaphors underlying file-change semantics \& discourse representation theory. The pragmatic operations whereby the continuation of an utterance in discourse motivates a reinterpretation of its truth-conditional meaning are easily treated as preliminary to a static semantic interpretation of a sentence tokened by the cumulation of utterances. Problems of anaphora, the insertion of namely variables &/or negation, donkey sentences, \& so-called dynamic conjunction are resolved by truth-conditional semantic analyses that take into account the ubiquitous context dependence of meanings in natural language. 1 Appendix, 42 References.

Such problem requires careful design decisions in order to provide a seamless system infrastructure capable of supporting flexible interactions in the shared scenarios. The complexity of this domain has systems that provide This paper presents a VE that ad-hoc solutions to led to intricate software specific problems. Furthermore, many of them have gone to a dead end, due to their non-extensible design and their lack of code and module reuse. is constructed on top of a component groupware framework. Our major aim is to provide an extensible infrastructure offering a set of collaborative services in a seamless way. At the conceptual level, it provides essential collaborative services: shared sessions, support for synchronous and asynchronous components, security, coordination, and a server-side awareness infrastructure. At the architectural level, the framework is constructed on top of a middleware integration platform and uses high performance publish/subscribe notification services. Finally, we present the advantages and limitations of this approach.},

To do so, we seek to set up a common set of expectations and criteria for how to judge our work. In this paper, we propose some subclasses of embodied conversational character research and design, with criteria for describing and evaluating research and design advances in each. We suggest that researchers in this field could benefit from carefully identifying their own areas of expertise and contribution, and then looking for ways to collaborate on standards and share advances within these sub- areas. Presenting results, then, would require making clear the sub-areas addressed by the particular project, with evaluations appropriate to those areas included. We believe this approach can help the research community to clarify contributions, and more easily build a common base of knowledge.},

Participants read a sentence composed by either an observation or an action verb (Look at/Grasp) followed by an object name. They had to decide whether the visual object following the sentence was the same as the one mentioned in the sentence. Objects graspable with either a precision or a power grip were presented in an orientation affording action (canonical) or not. Action sentences were faster than observation sentences, and power grip objects were faster than precision grip objects. Moreover, faster RTs were obtained when orientation afforded action. Results indicate that the simulation activated during language comprehension leads to the formation of a "motor prototype" of the object. This motor prototype encodes information on temporary/canonical and stable affordances (e.g., orientation, size), which can be possibly referred to different cognitive and neural systems (dorsal, ventral systems).

Drawing on a study of children's transitions to secondary school, we analyse the emotional processes through which particular schools come to be 'demonized' in the minds of Year 6 children, consider the impact such damaging discourses have on children who were to go to those schools, and explore connections between social and psychic realities in the increasing polarization of secondary schools. We examine the impact of discourses of race and racism on the psychic construction of 'good' and 'bad' schools and explore how this connected with family practices of secondary school choice and current constructions of UK local educational markets.},

This foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (NLP) to appear. The book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building NLP tools. It provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. The book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications. More on this book},

  abstract  = {In this paper several methods for animacy recognition are evaluated. Each method has an increasing complexity over the previous one and involves more resources, and as a result, more computation. When assessing the performace of these methods we consider three factors: the results of an intrinsic evaluation, the results of an extrinsic evaluation, and the complexity of the method. For intrinsic evaluation the accuracy of the overall classification is considered as well as the precision and recall for each type classification. In the extrinsic evaluation, the animacy classifier is used to filter candidates in a pronominal anaphora resolution system. Given the wide variety of texts used, an anaphora resolution system could not be used for this evaluation because its performance depends upon the genre of the text being processed. For this reason, the reduction of the number of candidates, the reduction of the number of antecedents, and the increase in the number of pronouns without any antecedents were recorded and used to differentiate between the systems. Comparison between different systems showed that the best one is the system which uses machine learning, and that the additional information brought by different modules does not lead to an increase in the success of the system due to the errors introduced by them.},

The new field of hypercomputation studies models of computation that can compute more than the Turing machine and addresses their implications. In this report, I survey much of the work that has been done on hypercomputation, explaining how such non-classical models fit into the classical theory of computation and comparing their relative powers. I also examine the physical requirements for such machines to be constructible and the kinds of hypercomputation that may be possible within the universe. Finally, I show how the possibility of hypercomputation weakens the impact of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and Chaitin's discovery of 'randomness' within arithmetic.},

The Nature of Design, on the other hand, is about starting things, specifically an ecological design revolution that changes how we provide food, shelter, energy, materials, and livelihood, and how we deal with waste. Ecological design is an emerging field that aims to recalibrate what humans do in the world according to how the world works as a biophysical system. Design in this sense is a large concept having to do as much with politics and ethics as with buildings and technology. The book begins by describing the scope of design, comparing it to the Enlightenment of the 18th century. Subsequent chapters describe barriers to a design revolution inherent in our misuse of language, the clockspeed of technological society, and shortsighted politics. Orr goes on to describe the critical role educational institutions might play in fostering design intelligence and what he calls "a higher order of heroism." Appropriately, the book ends on themes of charity, wilderness, and the rights of children. Astute yet broadly appealing, The Nature of Design combines theory, practicality, and a call to action.},

In this paper, we investigate the difficulties inherent in home care collaboration. We present the results of a study carried out with home care clinicians in Saskatoon District Health, and identify five areas of collaboration that are difficult for home care workers: scheduling, information dissemination, information retrieval, short-term treatment coordination, and long-term treatment planning. We present recommendations for incorporating support for each of these areas into point-of-care clinical information systems that provide access to shared patient records. Finally, we discuss general design approaches for incorporating this type of support, including the need for workers to maintain awareness of the activities of others, and the need to integrate communication with the presentation of the health record.},

  abstract  = {When, using Aspect Oriented Programming in the development of software components, a developer must understand the program units actually changed by weaving, how they behave, and possibly correct the aspects used. Support for rapid AOP prototyping and debugging is therefore crucial in such situations. Rapid prototyping is difficult with current aspect weaving tools because they do not support dynamic changes. This paper describes PROSE (PROgrammable ex-tenSions of sErvices), a platform based on Java which addresses dynamic AOP. Aspects are expressed in the same source language as the application (Java), and PROSE allows aspects to be woven, unwoven, or replaced at run-time.},

However, a difficult question arises for psychologists and communication researchers: "What are the communicative characteristics of CMC?" According to the "cues-filtered-out" approach, CMC lacks the specifically relational features (social cues), which enable the interlocutors to identify correctly the kind of interpersonal situations they find themselves in. This paper counters this vision by integrating in its theoretical frame the different psycho-social approaches available in current literature. In particular, the paper describes the characteristics of the socio-cognitive processes-emotional expression, context definition, and identity creation-used by the interlocutors to make order and create relationships out of the miscommunication processes typical of CMC. Moreover, it presents the emerging forms of CMC-instant messaging, shared hypermedia, weblogs, and graphical chats-and their possible social and communicative effects.},

They tend to mentally undo the most recent event in a temporal sequence of two events. But they tend to mentally undo the first event in a causal sequence of four events. We report the results of two experiments that show that the temporal and causal order effects are not dependent on the number of events in the sequence. Our first experiment, with 300 participants, shows that the temporal order effect occurs for sequences with four events as well as for sequences with two events. Our second experiment, with 372 participants, shows that the causal order effect occurs for sequences with two events as well as for sequences with four events. We discuss the results in terms of the mental representations that people construct of temporal and causal sequences.},

In a previous paper, we have introduced an industrial district computational prototype, showing that the economic performance of an industrial district proceeds to the form through which firms interact and co-ordinate each others. In this paper, we use such computational framework to experiment different options of 'local institutional engineering', trying to understand how specific 'supporting institutions' could perform macro-collective activities, such as, i.e., technology research, transfer and information, improving the technological adaptation of firms. Is a district more than a simple aggregation of localised firms? What can explain the economic performance of firms localised into the same space? Could some options of 'local institutional engineering' improve the performance of a district? Could such options set aside the problem of how firms dynamically interact? These are questions explored in this paper. },

We confront this enhanced rule learning model with experimental data on games with multiple equilibria and separatrix-crossing behavior.

It is paradoxical that their theorizing and their study, at the core of neoclassical sociology, have been neglected for some time by sociologists, and major advances made from perspectives of rational choice. The marginalization of norms within recent sociology is critically discussed. An analytical field, and some tools for ploughing it, are laid out: of three basic kinds of norms, of normative and non-normative action, of different kinds of fundamental institutions, of bases of norm conformity, and of the dynamics and change of norms. The relevance of normative analysis to a range of areas, from globalization to families, is indicated.},

  abstract  = {As Internet resources are used more frequently for research on social and psychological behavior, concerns grow about whether characteristics of such research affect human subjects protections. Early efforts to address such concerns have done more to identify potential problems than to evaluate them or to seek solutions, leaving bodies charged with human subjects oversight in a quagmire. This article critiques some of these issues in light of the US Code of Federal Regulations' policies for the Protection of Human Subjects, and argues that some of the issues have no pertinence when examined in the context of common methodological approaches that previous commentators failed to consider. By separating applicable contexts from those that are not, and by identifying cases where subjects' characteristics are irrelevant and/or impossible to provide, oversight committees may be able to consider research applications more appropriately, and investigators may be less ethically bound to ascertain and demonstrate those characteristics.},

  abstract  = {An important concept for intelligent agent systems is goals. Goals have two aspects: declarative (a description of the state sought), and procedural (a set of plans for achieving the goal). A declarative view of goals is necessary in order to reason about important properties of goals, while a procedural view of goals is necessary to ensure that goals can be achieved efficiently in dynamic environments. In this paper we propose a framework for goals which integrates both views. We discuss the requisite properties of goals and the link between the declarative and procedural aspects, then derive a formal semantics which has these properties. We present a high-level plan notation with goals and give its formal semantics. We then show how the use of declarative information permits reasoning (such as the detection and resolution of conflicts) to be performed on goals.},
