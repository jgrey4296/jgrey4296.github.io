 abstract     = {Combining a system dynamics and agent based modeling approach, we formalize a simulation framework of the Human Development (HD) perspective. Based on a system of asymmetric, coupled nonlinear equations, we first capture the core logic of HD theory, empirically validated from World Values Survey (WVS) data. Using the framework of evolutionary game theory, second we fuse these endogenously derived individual socio-economic attribute changes with Prisoner's Dilemma in an agent based framework to model the interactive political-cultural effects of heterogeneous, spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We explore the model's behavioral dynamics via simulation methods to identify paths and pitfalls towards economic development, cultural plasticity, and social change behavior. Our preliminary results suggest strong nonlinear path dependence in three areas: development processes, evolutionary intra-societal transactions and development trajectories, with significant implications for anticipating and managing positive development outcomes.},

 abstract     = {In the past years, there has been a surge in game controllers that allow players to play in a more physical, more natural way. In this paper we present an experimental study of the effect of gaming using these naturally mapped controllers on the player experience in a social setting. Results support the hypothesis that more naturally mapped controllers augment spatial presence. Furthermore, the results suggest that gaming with more naturally mapped controllers augment social presence for female players, but not for male players. However, gaming via naturally mapped controllers decreases perceived control and actual performance. Hence, users with high performance expectations might not benefit from gaming via naturally mapped controllers.},

We propose a system which allows for physical therapists to aid in the creation and management of virtual environments for use in conjunction with walking and balance exercises. Our system allows the therapist to design a 3D path with challenges including hills and turns suitable for the ability of the patient. After the path has been designed, the system generates a terrain using an iter- ative surface-matching quadtree algorithm, culminating in an immersive, engaging environment for the patient.},

In this work we develop both a general framework and specific implementation for providing a designer a way to reason about and edit a game level's playspace. Our system enables a designer to specify edits to playspace properties using a small set of local playspace edits and constraints. It then automatically (via optimization) produces a new level configuration that reflects the desired playspace changes. We present results from our system demonstrating the usefulness of our approach. This work constitutes an initial step toward a fully-realized playspace level design tool.},

 abstract     = {Using an economic bargaining game, we tested for the existence of two phenomena related to social norms, namely norm manipulation - the selection of an interpretation of the norm that best suits an individual - and norm evasion - the deliberate, private violation of a social norm. We found that the manipulation of a norm of fairness was characterized by a self-serving bias in beliefs about what constituted normatively acceptable behaviour, so that an individual who made an uneven bargaining offer not only genuinely believed it was fair, but also believed that recipients found it fair, even though recipients of the offer considered it to be unfair. In contrast, norm evasion operated as a highly explicit process. When they could do so without the recipient's knowledge, individuals made uneven offers despite knowing that their behaviour was unfair. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We investigated the specific effects of gluten after dietary reduction of fermentable, poorly absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates (fermentable, oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols [FODMAPs]) in subjects believed to have NCGS. Methods We performed a double-blind cross-over trial of 37 subjects (aged 24-61 y, 6 men) with NCGS and irritable bowel syndrome (based on Rome III criteria), but not celiac disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given a 2-week diet of reduced FODMAPs, and were then placed on high-gluten (16 g gluten/d), low-gluten (2 g gluten/d and 14 g whey protein/d), or control (16 g whey protein/d) diets for 1 week, followed by a washout period of at least 2 weeks. We assessed serum and fecal markers of intestinal inflammation/injury and immune activation, and indices of fatigue. Twenty-two participants then crossed over to groups given gluten (16 g/d), whey (16 g/d), or control (no additional protein) diets for 3 days. Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales. Results In all participants, gastrointestinal symptoms consistently and significantly improved during reduced FODMAP intake, but significantly worsened to a similar degree when their diets included gluten or whey protein. Gluten-specific effects were observed in only 8 },

In this paper we propose a possible integration of the two views and support it proposing the idea of ``Words As social Tools'' (WAT). In this respect, we will propose that words, also due to their social and public character, can be conceived as quasi-external devices that extend our cognition. Moreover, words function like tools in that they enlarge the bodily space of action thus modifying our sense of body. To support our proposal, we review the relevant literature on tool-use and on words as tools and report recent evidence indicating that word use leads to an extension of space close to the body. In addition, we outline a model of the neural processes that may underpin bodily space extension via word use and may reflect possible effects on cognition of the use of words as external means. We also discuss how reconciling the two perspectives can help to overcome the limitations they encounter if considered independently.},

We use the language Celf to represent narrative knowledge, and its own querying mechanism to generate story instances, through a number of proof terms. Each proof term obtained is used, through a resource-flow analysis, to build a directed graph where nodes are narrative actions and edges represent inferred causality relationships. Such graphs represent narrative plots structured by narrative causality. This approach is a candidate technique for narrative generation which unifies declarative representations and generation via query and deduction mechanisms},

Consumer suspicion may undermine the building of brand trust through attempts to incorporate corporate social responsibility (CSR) into brand identity.

One response is to set authenticity at the center of CSR discussions by broadening the ethics used to conceive a business's role in society and international commerce.

In particular, we describe the simple and elegant interface shared by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its advantages in terms of composition and reusability. The paper also comments on implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles faced by users and developers of the library.},

The datasets for the analysis have been extracted from the web sites that record the players' ratings and a number of empirical metrics. Results suggest that the HoN's Matchmaking rating algorithm, while generally capturing the skill level of the player well, also has weaknesses, which have been exploited by players to achieve a higher placement on the ranking ladder than deserved by actual skill. In addition, we also illustrate the effects of the choice of the business model (from pay-to-play to free-to-play) on player population.},

Children with autism have been reported to exhibit deficits in the recognition of affective expressions. With the appropriate intervention, elimination of those deficits can be achieved. Interventions are proposed to start as early as possible. Computer-based programs have been widely used with success to teach people with autism to recognize emotions. However, those computer interventions require considerable skills for interaction. Such abilities are beyond very young children with autism as they have major restriction in their ability to interact with computers. Our approach takes account of the specific characteristics of preschoolers with autism and their physical inabilities. By creating an educational computer game which provides physical interaction, we aim to support early intervention and to foster emotion learning.},

In this paper, I develop a model of this process of job design by drawing on a multisite qualitative study of task allocation following the installation of a DNA sequencer. The model that emerges is one of the assembly of tasks through multiple subassembly processes with multiple assemblers. Four activities produced requirements and requests for job designs and propositions about how to meet these: actively searching, passively receiving, doing work, and invoking preexisting ideas. The ideas that emerge from these processes are further transformed through reconciliation, interpretation, and performance. My observations show that this overall process is far reaching and incorporates many elements, not all of which are explicitly intended for job designs. The arrangements that emerge from this process are not the product of a deliberate and controlled job design process within the boundaries of a single organization},

 abstract     = {Norms have been promoted as a coordination mechanism for controlling agent behaviours in open MAS. Thus, agent platforms must provide normative support, allowing both norm-aware and non-norm-aware agents to take part in MAS that are controlled by norms. In this paper, the most relevant proposals on the definition of norm enforcement mechanisms are analyzed. These proposals present several drawbacks that make them unsuitable for open MAS. In response to these problems, this paper describes a new Norm-Enforcing Architecture aimed at controlling norms in open MAS. Specifically, this architecture supports the creation and deletion of norms on-line as well as the dynamic activation and expiration of instances. Finally, it can dynamically adapt to different scale MAS. The efficiency of this architecture has been experimentally evaluated and the results are shown in this paper. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In a previous paper, we analyzed the levels in this game to nd a set of recurring level design patterns, and discussed an implementation where levels were produced from concatenation of these patterns. In this paper, we instead propose using patterns as design objectives. An implementation of this based on evolutionary computation is presented. In this implementation, levels are represented as a set of vertical slices from the original game, and the tness function count the number of patterns found. Qualitative analysis of generated levels is performed in order to identify strengths and challenges of this method.},

Our starting point is a new corpus of requests annotated for politeness, which we use to evaluate aspects of politeness theory and to uncover new interactions between politeness markers and context. These findings guide our construction of a classifier with domain-independent lexical and syntactic features operationalizing key components of politeness theory, such as indirection, deference, impersonalization and modality. Our classifier achieves close to human performance and is effective across domains. We use our framework to study the relationship between politeness and social power, showing that polite Wikipedia editors are more likely to achieve high status through elections, but, once elevated, they become less polite. We see a similar negative correlation between politeness and power on Stack Exchange, where users at the top of the reputation scale are less polite than those at the bottom. Finally, we apply our classifier to a preliminary analysis of politeness variation by gender and community.},

 abstract     = {Cognitive science arose in the 1950s when it became apparent that a number of disciplines, including psychology, computer science, linguistics, and philosophy, were fragmenting. Perhaps owing to the field's immediate origins in cybernetics, as well as to the foundational assumption that cognition is information processing, cognitive science initially seemed more unified than psychology. However, as a result of differing interpretations of the foundational assumption and dramatically divergent views of the meaning of the term information processing, three separate schools emerged: classical cognitive science, connectionist cognitive science, and embodied cognitive science. Examples, cases, and research findings taken from the wide range of phenomena studied by cognitive scientists effectively explain and explore the relationship among the three perspectives. Intended to introduce both graduate and senior undergraduate students to the foundations of cognitive science, Mind, Body, World addresses a number of questions currently being asked by those practicing in the field: What are the core assumptions of the three different schools? What are the relationships between these different sets of core assumptions? Is there only one cognitive science, or are there many different cognitive sciences? Giving the schools equal treatment and displaying a broad and deep understanding of the field, Dawson highlights the fundamental tensions and lines of fragmentation that exist among the schools and provides a refreshing and unifying framework for students of cognitive science.},

Patterns should prescribe generic solutions to common problems. Finally, in order to create libraries with a large expressive range, the number of patterns is of less importance than the number of interactions between the patterns.},

 abstract     = {The analysis of user behavior in digital games has been aided by the introduction of user telemetry in game development, which provides unprecedented access to quantitative data on user behavior from the installed game clients of the entire population of players. Player behavior telemetry datasets can be exceptionally complex, with features recorded for a varying population of users over a temporal segment that can reach years in duration. Categorization of behaviors, whether through descriptive methods (e.g. segmentation) or unsupervised/supervised learning techniques, is valuable for finding patterns in the behavioral data, and developing profiles that are actionable to game developers. There are numerous methods for unsupervised clustering of user behavior, e.g. k-means/c-means, Non- negative Matrix Factorization, or Principal Component Analysis. Although all yield behavior categorizations, interpretation of the resulting categories in terms of actual play behavior can be difficult if not impossible. In this paper, a range of unsupervised techniques are applied together with Archetypal Analysis to develop behavioral clusters from playtime data of 70,014 World of Warcraft players, covering a five year interval. The techniques are evaluated with respect to their ability to develop actionable behavioral profiles from the dataset.},

If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict.We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not).We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect.We also show that this pattern holds in six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence that price shocks affect conflict in different directions depending on the type of the commodity.},

Following design principles from proof theory, bidirectional typing can be applied to many type constructs. The principles underlying a bidirectional approach to polymorphism, however, are less obvious. We give a declarative, bidirectional account of higher-rank polymorphism, grounded in proof theory; this calculus enjoys many properties such as eta-reduction and predictability of annotations. We give an algorithm for implementing the declarative system; our algorithm is remarkably simple and well-behaved, despite being both sound and complete.},

 abstract     = {Social systems are among the most complex known. This poses particular problems for those who wish to understand them. The complexity often makes analytic approaches infeasible and natural language approaches inadequate for relating intricate cause and effect. However, individual- and agent-based computational approaches hold out the possibility of new and deeper understanding of such systems. Simulating Social Complexity examines all aspects of using agent- or individual-based simulation. This approach represents systems as individual elements having each their own set of differing states and internal processes. The interactions between elements in the simulation represent interactions in the target systems. What makes these elements ``social'' is that they are usefully interpretable as interacting elements of an observed society. In this, the focus is on human society, but can be extended to include social animals or artificial agents where such work enhances our understanding of human society. The phenomena of interest then result (emerge) from the dynamics of the interaction of social actors in an essential way and are usually not easily simplifiable by, for example, considering only representative actors. The introduction of accessible agent-based modelling allows the representation of social complexity in a more natural and direct manner than previous techniques. In particular, it is no longer necessary to distort a model with the introduction of overly strong assumptions simply in order to obtain analytic tractability. This makes agent-based modelling relatively accessible to a range of scientists. The outcomes of such models can be displayed and animated in ways that also make them more interpretable by experts and stakeholders. This handbook is intended to help in the process of maturation of this new field. It brings together, through the collaborative effort of many leading researchers, summaries of the best thinking and practice in this area and constitutes a reference point for standards against which future methodological advances are judged. This book will help those entering into the field to avoid ''reinventing the wheel'' each time, but it will also help those already in the field by providing accessible overviews of current thought. The material is divided into four sections: Introductory, Methodology, Mechanisms, and Applications. Each chapter starts with a very brief section called 'Why read this chapter?' followed by an abstract, which summarizes the content of the chapter. Each chapter also ends with a section of 'Further Reading' briefly describing three to eight items that a newcomer might read next.},

First a review of the field is presented followed by analyses of adolescents' media use and parental strategies for regulation. Data was derived from a Swedish survey of parents-Predominantly mothers-of adolescents aged 9-16 complemented with data from a separate survey of adolescents aged 9-16. Analyses are presented using gamma coefficients for bivariate correlations and linear regression models for multivariate analyses. We conclude that parents in this study are involved in their adolescents' gaming and Internet by restricting access to these media. Boys and young adolescents are controlled more than girls and older adolescents. Mothers made use of restrictive mediation more than fathers. Parents harbour quite negative views on gaming which might interfere with a more active role of parents in mediating their children's gaming},

 abstract     = {Language workbenches are tools that provide high-level mechanisms for the implementation of (domain-specific) languages. Language workbenches are an active area of research that also receives many contributions from industry. To compare and discuss existing language workbenches, the annual Language Workbench Challenge was launched in 2011. Each year, participants are challenged to realize a given domain-specific language with their workbenches as a basis for discussion and comparison. In this paper, we describe the state of the art of language workbenches as observed in the previous editions of the Language Workbench Challenge. In particular, we capture the design space of language workbenches in a feature model and show where in this design space the participants of the 2013 Language Workbench Challenge reside. We compare these workbenches based on a DSL for questionnaires that was realized in all workbenches.},

Our main goal is to in- vestigate the exploration and exploitation patterns in game- play of preschoolers, as well as, the interaction patterns when preschoolers interact with Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) using voice. The application contains two modes (story and games) that roughly correspond to explo- ration and exploitation strategies, and the user is allowed to switch between those modes at will. Results show that younger children tend to use exploratory strategies more of- ten, while older children are more efficient in designing such strategies. Although there is a clear age trend, the explo- ration vs. exploitation dilemma is shown to be very much child dependent. The implications of this study for design- ing games for preschoolers are discussed.},

But while Racket retains the functional goodness of Lisp, it was designed with beginning programmers in mind. Realm of Racket is your introduction to the Racket language. In Realm of Racket, you'll learn to program by creating increasingly complex games. Your journey begins with the Guess My Number game and coverage of some basic Racket etiquette. Next you'll dig into syntax and semantics, lists, structures, and conditionals, and learn to work with recursion and the GUI as you build the Robot Snake game. After that it's on to lambda and mutant structs (and an Orc Battle), and fancy loops and the Dice of Doom. Finally, you'll explore laziness, AI, distributed games, and the Hungry Henry game. As you progress through the games, chapter checkpoints and challenges help reinforce what you've learned. Offbeat comics keep things fun along the way. As you travel through the Racket realm, you'll: Master the quirks of Racket's syntax and semanticsLearn to write concise and elegant functional programsCreate a graphical user interface using the 2htdp/image libraryCreate a server to handle true multiplayer gamesRealm of Racket is a lighthearted guide to some serious programming.

Card games are represented in a previously devised card game description language, a context-free grammar. The syntax of this language allows us to use grammar-guided genetic programming. Candidate card games are evaluated through a cascading evaluation function, a multi-step process where games with undesired properties are progressively weeded out. Three representa- tive examples of generated games are analysed. We observed that these games are reasonably balanced and have skill ele- ments, they are not yet entertaining for human players. The particular shortcomings of the examples are discussed in re- gard to the generative process to be able to generate quality games.},

At the same time, researchers have paid less attention to investigating the usability of common visualization techniques that many practitioners regularly use to visualize ontological data. In this paper, we focus on two popular ontology visualization techniques: indented tree and graph. We conduct a controlled usability study with an emphasis on the effectiveness, efficiency, workload and satisfaction of these visualization techniques in the context of assisting users during evaluation of ontology mappings. Findings from this study have revealed both strengths and weaknesses of each visualization technique. In particular, while the indented tree visualization is more organized and familiar to novice users, subjects found the graph visualization to be more controllable and intuitive without visual redundancy, particularly for ontologies with multiple inheritance.},

But when the sun rises, the vampires are forced to employ the services of a human who acts as their daytime fixer and protector...Trained for centuries to be the mortal soldiers of their vampire employers, the Day Men go forth at sunrise, alone into the world, to do the bidding of their sleeping benefactors. Written by Matt Gagnon (FREELANCERS) \& Michael Alan Nelson (DC's SUPERGIRL, HEXED) and drawn by industry legend Brian Stelfreeze. DAY MEN is a sexy, action-packed epic that brings modern master Brian Stelfreeze back to drawing monthly comics for the first time since 2005!},

This motivates the development and application of systems AI methodologies. Here we demonstrate for the first time the iterative development of agent behaviour for a real-time strategy game (here StarCraft) utilising Behaviour Oriented Design (BOD). BOD provides focus on the robust creation and easy adjustment of modular and hierarchical cognitive agents. We demonstrate BOD?s usage in creating an AI capable of playing the StarCraft character the Zerg hive mind, and document its performance against a variety of opponent AI systems. In describing our tool-driven development process, we also describe the new Abode IDE, provide a brief literature review situating BOD in the AI game literature, and propose possible future work.},

 abstract     = {Part of Academia's motivation for improving agent-based languages and architectures is the hope that some of its solutions might be, one day, adopted by the videogame industry for specification of agents' behavior. However, the games industry already employs its own techniques for that purpose. Thus we need rigorous empirical data to provide an insight to the expected utility of academic solutions and pinpoint their most promising features. Game pro-grammers often face situations when they have to understand and modify the work of current or former colleagues, or to extend their own work from months or even years ago. Thus, one way an academia's solution could provide value would be that it outperforms the industry's typical approach under these circumstances - offering better code readability and maintainability. Here we present results of an empirical study modeling this problem. We adopt Java programming as the industry approach (modeling scripting) and choose the POSH reactive planner as an academic approach. We engaged 22 computer science students attending a university course on virtual agents on two programming assignments, in which they had to produce specific high-level behaviors of 3D virtual agents solving different game-like tasks. First, students had to produce the behavior of a particular task from scratch. Second, these behaviors were used in an assignment where students had to extend the behavior coded by someone else. Finally, three months later, 8 of these students were told to extend their own behavior they coded in the first assignment. The quantitative results indicate that Java is as good as POSH in terms of subjective programmers' preference and that there is no objective difference between qualities of created behaviors. The qualitative results suggest several useful but also troublesome features of POSH, some of which are shared by other languages, suggesting possible improvements.},

 abstract     = {This is a book about how to prove theorems. Until this point in your education, mathematics has probably been presented as a primarily computational discipline. You have learned to solve equations, compute derivatives and integrals, multiply matrices and find determinants; and you have seen how these things can answer practical questions about the real world. In this setting, your primary goal in using mathematics has been to compute answers. But there is another side of mathematics that is more theoretical than computational. Here the primary goal is to understand mathematical structures, to prove mathematical statements, and even to invent or discover new mathematical theorems and theories. The mathematical techniques and procedures that you have learned and used up until now are founded on this theoretical side of mathematics. For example, in computing the area under a curve, you use the fundamental theorem of calculus. It is because this theorem is true that your answer is correct. However, in learning calculus you were probably far more concerned with how that theorem could be applied than in understanding why it is true. But how do we know it is true? How can we convince ourselves or others of its validity? Questions of this nature belong to the theoretical realm of mathematics. This book is an introduction to that realm. This book will initiate you into an esoteric world. You will learn and apply the methods of thought that mathematicians use to verify theorems, explore mathematical truth and create new mathematical theories. This will prepare you for advanced mathematics courses, for you will be better able to understand proofs, write your own proofs and think critically and inquisitively about mathematics.},

The paper follows Calleja's [3] premise that immersion, defined as ''the player's sensation of inhabiting the virtual environment represented onscreen'', is not a stand-alone experience but the result from a blending of a variety of experiential phenomena afforded by involving gameplay. These experiential phenomena are described in Calleja's [3] player involvement model, developed through qualitative research and identifying six dimensions of involvement in digital games. The aim of our study was to test this player involvement model and its possible conclusion in immersion in a quantitative context. The paper describes the execution of an experimental study in which we manipulated one dimension of player involvement (i.e. narrative involvement), and analyzed how this affects the other dimensions of player involvement on the one hand, and immersion on the other. Our results provide initial support for Calleja's [3] model, showing that the dimensions of player involvement are interrelated, and have a significant and positive effect on a player's sense of immersion.},

 abstract     = {Weber's ideal typical model of bureaucracy constitutes the starting point for most scholarship on organizations. Much organizational behaviour, however occurs outside this formalized model. It is thus somewhat surprising that behaviours outside the formal-rational model are, more often than not, treated as aberrations. In contrast, the emerging critical literature on 'inhabited institutions' has identified such gaps in our theoretical understanding as foundational, warranting a more agentic conception of organizational life-a conception more fully acknowledging of and sensitive to the dynamics of power in organizational life. In this regard, we highlight four prevalent (though seldom theoretically incorporated) features of contemporary bureaucracies-divergent goals, patrimonialism, unwritten rules and chaos. These features, which we contend are no less critical to organizational functioning than those identified by Weber, constitute an organizational logic more compatible with a Kafkan vision of bureaucracy than with a Weberian one. Theorizing such attributes allows us to explore elements of bureaucratic life that the formal-rational model of bureaucracy renders largely invisible and is conceptually and empirically ill equipped to incorporate. An illustrative analysis, drawing on narrative data drawn from the population of organizational ethnographies (n = 162) (1) demonstrates the prominence of such dynamics in organizational life; and (2) highlights their implications for rule breaking as a relatively common yet under-theorized occurrence. A core implication of our analysis and critique is that the social sciences need a fundamentally revised theory of bureaucracy capable of understanding bureaucracy's power laden and often dystrophic features.},

 abstract     = {The design of intelligent socio-technical systems calls for careful examination of relevant social and organizational concepts. We present a method for supporting this design process, placing emphasis on different levels of formal characterization, with equal attention to both the analysis of concepts in a formal calculus independent of computational concerns, and the representation of concepts in a machine-processable form, fully cognizant of implementation issues-a step in the method we refer to as principled operationalization. There are many tools (i.e. formal languages) that can be used to support the design method; we define and discuss criteria for evaluating such tools. We believe that, were the method proposed to be adopted, it would enhance the state-of-the-art in the systematic design and engineering of socio-technical systems, respecting the fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of those tasks, in both their theoretical and practical dimensions.},

Effects arise from interactions between a client and an effect handler (interpreter); interactions may vary throughout the program and dynamically adapt to exe- cution conditions. Existing code that relies on monad transform- ers may be used with our library with minor changes, gaining effi- ciency over long monad stacks. In addition, our library has greater expressiveness, allowing for practical idioms that are inefficient, cumbersome, or outright impossible with monad transformers. Our alternative to a monad transformer stack is a single monad, for the coroutine-like communication of a client with its handler. Its type reflects possible requests, i.e., possible effects of a com- putation. To support arbitrary effects and their combinations, re- quests are values of an extensible union type, which allows adding and, notably, subtracting summands. Extending and, upon han- dling, shrinking of the union of possible requests is reflected in its type, yielding a type-and-effect system for Haskell. The library is lightweight, generalizing the extensible exception handling to other effects and accurately tracking them in types.},

 abstract     = {The idea of using evolutionary computation to train artifi- cial neural networks, or neuroevolution (NE), for reinforce- ment learning (RL) tasks has now been around for over 20 years. However, as RL tasks become more challenging, the networks required become larger, as do their genomes. But, scaling NE to large nets (i.e. tens of thousands of weights) is infeasible using direct encodings that map genes one-to- one to network components. In this paper, we scale-up our ``compressed'' network encoding where network weight ma- trices are represented indirectly as a set of Fourier-type co- efficients, to tasks that require very-large networks due to the high-dimensionality of their input space. The approach is demonstrated successfully on two reinforcement learning tasks in which the control networks receive visual input: (1) a vision-based version of the octopus control task requiring networks with over 3 thousand weights, and (2) a version of the TORCS driving game where networks with over 1 mil- lion weights are evolved to drive a car around a track using video images from the driver's perspective.},

 abstract     = {The development of and accessibility to rich virtual environments, both for recreation and training activities leads to the use of intelligent agents to control avatars (and other entities) in these environments. There is a fundamental tension in such systems between tight integration, for performance and low coupling, for generality, flexibility and extensibility. This paper addresses the engineering issues in connecting agent platforms and other software entities with virtual environments, driven by the following informal requirements: (i) accessibility: we would like (easily) to be able to connect any (legacy) software component with the virtual environment (ii) performance: we want the benefits of decoupling, but not at a high price in performance (iii) distribution: we would like to be able to locate functionality where needed, when necessary, but also be location agnostic otherwise (iv) scalability: we would like to support large-scale and geographically dispersed virtual environments. We start from the position that the basic currency unit of such systems can be events. We describe the Bath Sensor Framework, which is a middleware that attempts to satisfy the above goals and to provide a low-latency linking mechanism between event producers and event consumers, while minimising the effect of coupling of components. We illustrate the framework in two complementary case studies using the Jason agent platform, Second Life and AGAVE (a 3D VE for vehicles). Through these examples, we are able to carry out a preliminary evaluation of the approach against the factors above, against alternative systems and demonstrate effective distributed execution.},

Some forms, such as games, have been argued to be more successful at balancing the tension between interactivity and immersion than forms like hypertext fiction [16]. Using these two forms as illustration, this paper will argue for the need for more nuanced understandings of ``agency'' and ''immersion'' by introducing definitions of diegetic and extra-diegetic agency alongside definitions of narrative and mechanical immersion. Extending the vocabulary of agency and immersion highlights some key differences in how games and hypertexts have been understood.},

 abstract     = {Recommending products to consumers means not only understanding their tastes, but also understanding their level of experience. For example, it would be a mistake to recommend the iconic film Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys other action movies; rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy it -- once they are ready. The same is true for beers, wines, gourmet foods -- or any products where users have acquired tastes: the `best' products may not be the most `accessible'. Thus our goal in this paper is to recommend products that a user will enjoy now, while acknowledging that their tastes may have changed over time, and may change again in the future. We model how tastes change due to the very act of consuming more products -- in other words, as users become more experienced. We develop a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience. We find that such a model not only leads to better recommendations, but also allows us to study the role of user experience and expertise on a novel dataset of fifteen million beer, wine, food, and movie reviews.},

Despite the fact that the main focus of this domain remains on player entertainment and engagement, serious games have established themselves as an alternative educational paradigm. However, little interest has been given to investigating methods for the assessment of their effectiveness. Game evaluation focus remains on investigating usability and technical aspects. Those attempting to evaluate the educational impact typically rely on traditional questionnaires that typically negatively affecting user immersion and the overall game enjoyment. Among game genres, Interactive Digital Storytelling (IDS) is a fast growing genre that merges computer games, multimedia and cinematic storytelling with entertaining education. Like any other teaching intervention, educational IDS's have to be evaluated against a defined set of Learning Objectives (LOs). In this paper we present a User-Centred Seamless Evaluation Framework for IDS games and describe the algorithm for the integration of knowledge assessment to measure knowledge improvement against given LOs without affecting player enjoyment. We implement this algorithm in an educational game and show that the framework has been perceived by the majority of the players as a positive enhancement to the game, 94 },

Performers include the human and nonhuman, the living and the nonliving. Through all this runs a complexity of technics - technologies and techniques - and these increasingly involve computational processes. How do we think the last of these - computational processes in performance? [2] This article gives some answers to this question by engaging with four different but overlapping examples of the way that computational processes are brought into performance: the digital signal processing techique of convolution, live with the collaborative network performance softwares, keyworx. It suggests the necessity of understanding the imperceptible aspects of computaional processes, such as signal processing, as performing, even if not always directy presented. This in turn suggests a more subtle understanding of the micro-dynamics of perfomance in general. As part of this, i propose that more attention is paid to the transformation of signals of all kinds, in and perhaps even as performance. The article concludes by proposing that we now live, at least in part, in a culture of ongoing convolution of signals. Ghis is a culture more sefl-consciously immersed in the ongoing differentation (and integration) of intensities. The article therefore raises questions about the general perfomativity of a culture and technics increasingly enmeshed with computational processes.},

 abstract     = {In any political setting, a few people will defy political authority. The main challenge for theories of rebellion is to explain when and why others join en masse. Scholarship on social movements typically develops answers to this puzzle on the basis of either of two microfoundations. Explanations that conceptualize individuals as utility-maximizers contend that they protest as a means to other ends. Explanations that see individuals as driven by values and beliefs suggest that people protest for the inherent benefit of voicing dissent. Both perspectives generate compelling explanations. Yet how do purposeful individuals act when utilitarian calculations and cherished values recommend contrary courses of action? Why might an actor prioritize one or the other at different points in time? Taking on these questions, I argue for an approach to microfoundations that focuses on emotions. Emotions such as fear, sadness, and shame promote pessimistic assessments, risk aversion, and a low sense of control. Such dispiriting emotions encourage individuals to prioritize security and resign to political circumstances, even when they contradict values of dignity. By contrast, anger, joy, and pride promote optimistic assessments, risk acceptance, and feelings of personal efficacy. Such emboldening emotions encourage prioritization of dignity and increase willingness to engage in resistance, even when it jeopardizes security. When instrumentality and values offer different answers to the question of whether to resign or rebel, therefore, emotions can shift individuals toward one or the other. I ground this argument in findings from the neurosciences and illustrate it with evidence from the 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the absence of an uprising in Algeria.},

This contribution presents the application of soft computing techniques in the context of content generation for an on-line massive basketball management simulation game (in particular in the virtual trading market of the game). This application is developed in two different directions: (1) a machine learning model to analyze the appeal of the trading market contents (the virtual basketball players in the game), and (2) an evolutionary algorithm to assist users in the design of new contents (training of virtual basketball players).},

In this study, we closely followed the world's largest single location game jam in order to explore the engagement among participants. The authors joined the organizing group of the Nordic Game Jam 2013, and gained a favorable opportunity to observe the 470 game developers efforts during the 48 hours of non-stop development. The paper presents the results of two surveys conducted just before and after the event as well as observations during the game jam. The main motivational factors among participants were to develop games and to meet new people. We believe that the community building as well as the motivation and engagement due to social aspects and the desire to learn more about game development among participants at such events might have beneficial ripple effects, which are valuable to investigate more closely.},

 abstract     = {Over the last few years the idea of using video games for serious purposes such as education, training or health has gained widespread popularity. These games are, in contrast to their commercial counterparts, often meant to be played by single players. However, it has been shown that playing in groups trains social skills, supports collaborative learning and increases motivation. Multiplayer games therefore are especially suited for serious applications, but also pose additional challenges during their development. Since most serious games are made by smaller teams on a lower budget than commercial games, there already exist concepts to reduce the complexity of their development process. We are planning to extend one of these approaches, namely authoring tools, in order to explicitly addresses the development of multiplayer games. Our concept will include templates that reduce the complexity of their implementation and guide authors, analysis \& validation-algorithms that will give hints on how balanced a game is and rapid prototyping functionality that allows a single author to test the game in place of multiple players.},

The concept of nudge puts a label on efficacious influences that preserve freedom of choice without engaging the influencees' deliberative capacities. Given disagreements over what it takes genuinely to preserve freedom of choice, the question is whether health influences relying on automatic cognitive processes may preserve freedom of choice in a sufficiently robust sense to be serviceable for the moral evaluation of actions and policies. In this article, I offer an argument to this effect, explicating preservation of freedom of choice in terms of choice-set preservation and noncontrol. I also briefly explore the healthcare contexts in which nudges may have priority over more controlling influences.},

 abstract     = {Learning, is both an emotional and cognitive process and according to researchers and teachers worldwide, when players are engaged in activities that are intrinsically motivating, they are more prone to demonstrate deep learning [1]. Since 1981 when Malone used digital games as a medium in order to analyze intrinsic motivation, digital games have been reported to stimulate the students' interest, while motivating them to deploy control, curiosity and imagination [2] [3]. Studies within our research grouping have shown that Digital Games Based Learning (DGBL) can have a positive effect on some of the core development needs of people with Intellectual disabilities and associated sensory impairments [4], [5] One current of interests is the expansion of DGBL activities on mobile platforms specifically designed for users with intellectual disabilities. The RECALL Project describes the development and evaluation of a novel route learning system for people with disabilities using location based services (on the Android OS) and is the output of a EU award (504970-LLP-1-2009-1-UK-KA3-KA3MP). In the following paper we will present piloting findings from the piloting use of RouteMate application as well as an initial proposal of a playful location based DGBL integration in the educational experience of users with intellectual disabilities.},

 abstract     = {The Global Games Jam (GGJ) attracts many people who are passionate about games development, coming from a range of educational backgrounds. Therefore, the event can be experienced by novices and student developers as an opportunity for learning. This provides an opening to promote themes and ideas that could help form future thinking about games design, emerging as a form of induction on key design issues for new practitioners. Such an approach aims to raise awareness about issues which learners could help develop and take with them into industry. However, the experience itself affords a deep experiential rhetoric and dialogue with experts that could be an effective pedagogical tool for issues seldom addressed deeply in formal educational settings. This paper describes an account by one such individual, being introduced to game accessibility through participation in the GGJ. As such, it is not intended as a rigorous empirical analysis, but rather a perspective on one way a game jam can be experienced, inviting further research on the topic.},

However, due to the lack of accurate and reliable 3D genome structural data, this information is largely ignored and most of these studies have to use information systems that view the DNA in a linear structure. Visualizing genomes in real time 3D can give researchers more insight, but this is fraught with hardware limitations since each element contains vast amounts of information that cannot be processed on the fly. Using a game engine and sophisticated video game visualization techniques enables us to construct a multi-platform real-time 3D genome viewer. The game engine-based viewer achieves much better rendering speed and can handle much larger amounts of data compared to our previous implementation using OpenGL. Combining this viewer with 3D genome models from experimental data could provide unprecedented opportunities to gain insight into the conformation-function relationships of a genome.},

 abstract     = {There is currently great interest in the phylogenetic origins of altruistic behaviour within the primate order. Considerable attention has been focused on chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, because they are our closest living relatives and participate in a wide range of collective activities, including hunting and food sharing. Food sharing is of particular importance because it plays a critical role in the human foraging niche, but food sharing among adults is rare in nonhuman primates. Some research suggests that chimpanzees selectively share meat with reciprocating partners and allies, while other work indicates that chimpanzees primarily share to reduce harassment from other group members (tolerated theft). We examined the effects of kinship, relationship quality, reciprocity and the intensity of solicitations on the pattern of food transfers in six captive groups of chimpanzees. We observed events that occurred after the chimpanzees were provisioned with large frozen juice disks. These disks share some properties with prey carcasses: they are a valued, but limited, resource; they take a considerable period of time to consume; they can be monopolized by one individual, but bits can be broken off and transferred to others. Our analyses suggest that food transfers serve multiple functions for chimpanzees. Individuals may use food transfers to enhance the welfare of closely related group members, strengthen social relationships with favoured partners and reduce the costs of persistent solicitations. ?? 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Our approach comprises a shape data flow character and introduces some novel features, including recursion, parametric flow, and flow filtering. The main development model consists of encapsulating basic operations into semantically-rich, reusable components that can be more easily assembled using filters. Eventually, this enables users to concentrate on the more intuitive and interactive development layers, while the text-based grammar rules are automatically generated.},

Such a tool would allow programmers to better understand how their changes affect the behavior of their programs. As a proof of concept, we developed a prototype that found a bug that remained undetected by pair programmers working on JHotDraw in a previous study.

 abstract     = {Intuitively speaking, `` self-programming '' means the ability for a computer system to program its own actions. This notion is clearly related to Artificial Intelligence, and has been used by many researchers. Like many other high-level concepts, however, scrutiny shows that the term can be interpreted in several different ways. To make the discussion concrete and meaningful we introduce here a working definition of self-programming. In this definition we increase its concreteness while trying to keep the intuitive meaning of the concept. The activities of a computer system usually are considered to consist of atomic actions (which can also be called instructions, operations, behavior, or something else in different contexts). At any given moment the system's primitive actions are in a finite and constant set A, meaning that they are distinct from each other, and can be enumerated. An action may take some input arguments, and produce some output arguments. The system can execute each of its actions, This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.},

 abstract     = {Propositional Dynamic Logic or PDL was invented as a logic for reasoning about regular programming constructs. We propose a new perspective on PDL as a multi-agent strategic logic (MASL). This logic for strategic reasoning has group strategies as first class citizens, and brings game logic closer to standard modal logic. We demonstrate that MASL can express key notions of game theory, social choice theory and voting theory in a natural way, we give a sound and complete proof system for MASL, and we show that MASL encodes coalition logic. Next, we extend the language to epistemic multi-agent strategic logic (EMASL), we give examples of what it can express, we propose to use it for posing new questions in epistemic social choice theory, and we give a cal-culus for reasoning about a natural class of epistemic game models. We end by listing avenues for future research and by tracing connections to a number of other logics for reasoning about strategies.},

For identifying these attributes, we employed a mixed method research approach and analyzed the perceptions of players based on data from interviews and a survey. Player characters seem to be at the intersection of the game mechanics and the real life player personality and may constitute dynamic elements for supporting learning in a virtual environment.},

However, this alone is not sufficient to make the games seem be- lievable - the game world must also seem to be alive. In order to accomplish this, the world must be populated by realistic charac- ters who behave in a coherent and varied way. Many game develop- ers seem to realize this, and the capacity of the artificial intelligence controlled non-player characters in the games are often large selling points. However, as pointed out by recent research these opponents do not always exhibit realistic, coherent and varied behaviour. We have examined this phenomenon by analysing a number of games where non-player characters are especially important for the play- ers' enjoyment, and established six anti-heuristics that can be used to identify non-desirable behaviour in non-player characters.},

One obstacle in learning IT2 fuzzy logic is its complex notations. In this tutorial we try to avoid these notations and give the reader some intuitive understanding of IT2 FLSs. We also briefly discuss approaches for reducing the computational cost of IT2 FLSs and the fundamental differences between IT2 and type-1 FLSs.},

We examine some of the ways in which those opposed interests can manifest in a game's design. In particular, we examine those elements of a game's design whose purpose can be argued as questionable and perhaps even unethical. Building upon earlier work in design patterns, we call these abstracted elements Dark Game Design Patterns. In this paper, we develop the concept of dark design patterns in games, present examples of such patterns, explore some of the subtleties involved in identifying them, and provide questions that can be asked to help guide in the specification and identification of future Dark Patterns. Our goal is not to criticize creators but rather to contribute to an ongoing discussion regarding the values in games and the role that designers and creators have in this process.},

The complex issue of motivation to learn has been researched but results are inconclusive. How can hedonic and pragmatic qualities contribute to motivation to learn? In this study ARCS model of motivational design (Keller, 1987) and the UX model proposed by Hassenzahl et al. (2003) are employed as we are trying to interpret this complex phenomenon. A model with hedonic and pragmatic factors predicting motivation to learn is presented and discussed. A serious educational game is used and evaluated in elementary school settings as a complementary method to teach geography. Findings reveal that hedonic values are still strong and contribute in much higher degree to motivation to learn even though the purpose of the game is to learn. Understanding such relationships between motivation to learn and user experience perceptions (hedonic and pragmatic ones) may provide valuable input to the design and evaluation of serious games.},

Grammatical micropatterns bridge the gap between grammar metrics, which are easy to implement but hard to assign meaning to, and language design guidelines, which are inherently meaningful as stemming from current software language engineering practice but considerably harder to formalise.},
