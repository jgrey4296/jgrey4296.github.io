The agents under study are supersoft agents: autonomous artificial agents programmed to represent and evaluate vague and imprecise information. Agents are further assumed to act in accordance with advice obtained from a normative decision module, with which they can communicate. Norms act as global constraints on the evaluations performed in the decision module and hence no action that violates a norm will be suggested to any agent. Further constraints on action may then be added locally. The method strives to characterise real-time decision making in agents, in the presence of risk and uncertainty.},

The research is based on a particular concept of a bounded rational agent living in society and by a population based simulation model that describes the processes of social learning. From simple co-ordination problems, where conventions spontaneously emerge, to situations of choice over alternative constitutional rules, simulation was used as a means to test the consistency and extract the implications of the models. Institutions, as solutions to recurring problems of social interaction, are both results and preconditions for social life, unintended outcomes and human devised constraints. In an evolutionary setting no support is found for the deep rooted beliefs about the 'naturally' beneficial outcomes generated by 'invisible-hand' processes or by any alternative Hobbesian meta-agency. },

@article{card99_infor_forag_106,
 abstract     = {Information foraging theory is an approach to understanding how strategies and technologies for information seeking, gathering, and consumption are adapted to the flux of information in the environment. The theory assumes that people, when possible, will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information. The theory is developed by (a) adaptation (rational) analysis of information foraging problems and (b) a detailed process model (adaptive control of thought in information foraging [ACT-IF]). The adaptation analysis develops (a) information patch models, which deal with time allocation and information filtering and enrichment activities in environments in which information is encountered in clusters; (b) information scent models, which address the identification of information value from proximal cues; and (c) information diet models, which address decisions about the selection and pursuit of information items. ACT-IF is instantiated as a production system model of people interacting with complex information technology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

@inproceedings{floridi99_does_274137,
 abstract     = {The paper provides an axiological analysis of the concepts of respect for information and of information dignity from the vantage point provided by Information Ethics and the conceptual paradigm of object-oriented analysis (OOA). The general perspective adopted is that of an ontocentric approach to the philosophy of information ethics, according to which the latter is an expansion of environmental ethics towards a less biologically biased concept of a 'centre of ethical worth'. The paper attempts to answer the following question: what is the lowest possible common set of attributes which characterises something as intrinsically valuable and an object of respect, and without which something would rightly be considered intrinsically worthless or even positively unworthy and therefore rightly disrespectable in itself? The thesis developed and defended in the paper is that the minimal condition of possibility of an object's least intrinsic worthiness can be identified with its abstract nature as an information entity. Thus, all entities, interpreted as clusters of information, have a minimal moral worth qua information objects (i.e. qua information), that deserves to be respected. The principles elaborated in the course of the analysis are those of 'reflective respect' (A's respect towards all members of A's class motivated by A's respect towards A not qua individual, but qua instantiation of a class of entities), 'ontic uniformity' (A's recognition of A's membership to the class of information entities) and 'ontic solidarity' (A's recognition of any information entity's dignity).},

 abstract     = {While computer models provide many advantages over traditional experimental methods, they also raise several problems. The process of software development is a complicated task with high potential for errors, especially when it is carried out by scientists holding their expertise in other fields than computer science. On the other hand, the process of creating computer simulations of social systems which reflect the reality of such systems requires insights considerably beyond expertise in computer science. The Multi-Agent Modelling Language (MAML) is one of the efforts to ease these difficulties. In its current version, MAML is a macro-language for Swarm (a freely distributed toolset under development at SFI), but it is also part of a larger Swarm-independent framework. Also, the design of MAML, while influenced by concepts from Swarm, is general enough to allow for later extension of the supported simulation kernels. This paper gives an overview of the mentioned larger framework, with special emphasis on MAML and its graphical CASE tool, the Model Design Interface.},

 abstract     = {In social studies of technology, as in many other scientific disciplines, highly persuasive similes are at work: pious stories, seemingly reaped from research, suggesting certain general theoretical insights. Variously adapted, they are handed down: in the process, they acquire almost doctrinal unassailability. One such parable, which has been retold in technology and urban studies for a long time, is the story of Robert Moses' low bridges, preventing the poor and the black of New York from gaining access to Long Island resorts and beaches. The story turns out to be counterfactual, but even if a small myth is disenchanted, it serves a purpose: to resituate positions in the old debate about the control of social processes via buildings and other technical artefacts - or, more generally, about material form and social content.},

It considers the rich traditions of Arab, Jewish and Latin philosophy, which began to flourish in the ninth century and continued, in the Latin West, until the early seventeenth century. Among the philosophers treated in detail are Avicenna and Averroes, Maimonides, Eriugena, Anselm, Abelard, Grosseteste, Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Duns Scotus, Peter Aureoli, William of Ockham, Wyclif and Su{\'a}rez. An introductory chapter discusses Boethius, the late antique thinker who was enormously influential in the medieval Latin West. Special attention has been given to many lesser-known, but important figures in each period, as well as to medieval logic and to the cultural context of medieval philosophy, both in Islam and the Christian West. This volume provides a comprehensive analysis of the main areas of medieval philosophy by the experts in each field. It offers fresh perspectives on a complex and rapidly changing area of research, in which Arab and Jewish philosophy are considered in their own right, rather than as sources for Latin thinkers, and the thirteenth century (the time of Aquinas) is not viewed as dominating the earlier and later parts of the period.},

 abstract     = {Although redundancy in model specification generally has negative connotations, we offer arguments for revising those convictions. Defining &ldquo;representational redundancy&rdquo; as the inclusion of any symbols not required to fulfill the study objectives, we cite several sources of redundancy, classified as accidental or intentional, that contribute positively to the model development tasks. Comparative benefits and detriments are discussed briefly. Focusing on the most interesting source of redundancy&dash;that which is intentionally induced by a modeling methodology&mdash;we demonstrate that automated elimination of redundancy can actually improve model execution time. Using four models drawn from the literature that are easily understood, but which represent some differences in size and complexity, the direct graphical representations shows improvements over a base case ranging from 27.3 percent to 68.1 percent in execution time. Further, increasing improvement is realized with increasing model size and complexity. These results are encouraging because they suggest that modeling methodologies with automated model diagnosis can significantly reduce both execution and developments time and cost.},

@article{patrick99_simul_correc_distur_2,
 abstract     = {Inmate group behavior is a complex phenomenon that many researchers have attempted to understand. Most of the individual theories applied to this issue have had limited success. This work uses computer simulation to apply a complex theory of organizational control to the issue of inmate group behavior that incorporates all the major theoretical components found in the individual theories. The complete theory is first presented and then basic simulation results are discussed. The findings show that the simulated theory produced results that are empirically realistic. The control processes used by prisons generally produce compliance from inmates but these same control processes result in episodic periods of negative inmate group behavior. These initial results point to the promise of computer simulation for understanding complex control issues in ways simpler theories cannot. },

 abstract     = {Information foraging theory is an approach to understanding how strategies and technologies for information seeking, gathering, and consumption are adapted to the flux of information in the environment. The theory assumes that people, when possible, will modify their strategies or the structure of the environment to maximize their rate of gaining valuable information. The theory is developed by (a) adaptation (rational) analysis of information foraging problems and (b) a detailed process model (adaptive control of thought in information foraging [ACT-IF]). The adaptation analysis develops (a) information patch models, which deal with time allocation and information filtering and enrichment activities in environments in which information is encountered in clusters; (b) information scent models, which address the identification of information value from proximal cues; and (c) information diet models, which address decisions about the selection and pursuit of information items. ACT-IF is instantiated as a production system model of people interacting with complex information technology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

@inproceedings{rodriguez99_effec_fos_jun_b_krox_159,
 abstract     = {Activation of dopaminergic (DA) transmission by psychostimulants increases c-fos expression. d-Amphetamine-induced c-fos activation is reduced in the neostriatum deprived of DA afferents. Dopaminergic grafts implanted into the denervated neostriatum induce a c-fos hyperexpression when challenged with d-amphetamine, which is correlated with the exaggerated compensation of d-amphetamine-induced rotation. The aim of the present study was to test the generality of this phenomenon and the effects of DA grafts on the expression of three immediate early gene-coded proteins (c-Fos, Jun-B, Krox-24) following a challenge with either d-amphetamine or cocaine. c-fos basal expression was low in the neostriatum and was increased by the administration of psychostimulants. These effects were blocked by the DA lesion and restored by the DA grafts. A c-fos hyperexpression was observed within the grafted neostriatum, which was correlated with the compensation of d-amphetamine- or cocaine-induced rotation. Basal levels of Jun-B- and Krox-24-LI nuclei were high within the neostriatum. Administration of d-amphetamine or cocaine did not influence the expression of these IEG-coded proteins. Jun-B expression was not affected by the surgical procedure. In contrast, lesion of DA afferents of neostriatum decreased Krox-24 basal expression, an effect reversed by the grafts. Thus, the expression of c-fos but not Jun-B or Krox-24 appeared to be a good marker for the rotational behavior exhibited by DA-grafted rats challenged with drugs that increased DA transmission. This generalized c-fos overshoot indicates an abnormal activation of postsynaptic neurons by dopamine and points to its value as an indicator of the deleterious effects of DA grafts.},

Against this tradition, Richard Rorty convincingly argues, pragmatism offers a new philosophy of hope. One of the most controversial figures in recent philosophical and wider literary and cultural debate, Rorty brings together an original collection of his most recent philosophical and cultural writings. He explains in a fascinating memoir how he began to move away from Plato towards William James and Dewey, culminating in his own version of pragmatism. What ultimately matters, Rorty suggests, is not whether our ideas correspond to some fundamental reality but whether they help us carry out practical tasks and create a fairer and more democratic society.Aimed at a general audience, this volume offers a stimulating summary of Rorty's central philosophical beliefs, as well as some challenging insights into contemporary culture, justice, education, and love.},

@inproceedings{torre99_updat_seman_defeas_oblig_,
 abstract     = {The deontic logic DUS is a Deontic Update Semantics for prescriptive obligations based on the update semantics of Veltman. In DUS the definition of logical validity of obligations is not based on static truth values but on dynamic action transitions. In this paper prescriptive defeasible obligations are formalized in update semantics and the diagnostic problem of defeasible deontic logic is discussed. Assume a defeasible obligation `normally A ought to be (done)' together with the fact `A is not (done).' Is this an exception of the normality claim, or is it a violation of the obligation? In this paper we formalize the heuristic principle that it is a violation, unless there is a more specific overriding obligation. The underlying motivation from legal reasoning is that criminals should have as little opportunities as possible to excuse themselves by claiming that their behavior was exceptional rather than criminal.},

@article{yoshioka99_genre_taxon_19,
 abstract     = {We propose a genre taxonomy as a knowledge repository of communicative structures or " typified actions " enacted by organizational members. The genre taxonomy is intended to help people make sense of diverse types of communicative actions and provide ideas for improving work processes that coordinate the communication of information. It engages several features to achieve this objective. First, the genre taxonomy represents the elements of both genres and genre systems as embed-ded in a social context reflecting the communicative questions why, what, who, when, where, and how (5W1H). In other words, the genre taxonomy represents the purpose, content, participants, timing, location, and form of communicative action. Second, the genre taxonomy distinguishes between widely recognized genres such as a report and specific genres such as a particular com-pany's technical report, because the difference sheds light on the context of genre use. Third, the genre taxonomy represents use and evolution of a genre over time to help people understand how a genre is used and changed by a community over time. Fourth, the genre taxonomy represents aspects of information coordination via genres, thus providing ideas for improving work processes using genres. We have constructed a prototype of such a genre taxonomy using the Process Hand-book, a process knowledge repository developed at MIT. We have included both widely recognized genres such as the memo and specific genres such as those used in the Process Handbook itself. We suggest that this genre taxonomy may be useful in the innovation of new document templates or methods for communication because it helps to clarify different possible uses of similar gen-res and explicates how genres play a coordination role among people and between people and their tasks.},
