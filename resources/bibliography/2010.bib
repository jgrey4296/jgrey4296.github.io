@book{beaty10_how_canad_commun_3,
 abstract     = {How Canadians Communicate: Contexts of Popular Culture is the third in a series of books meant both to chronicle and to contribute to our understanding of the Canadian experience. The first volume focused on the challenges that Canadian media and communication industries faced as they entered the first years of the twenty-first century. The second volume dealt with the impact of globalization on Canadian media and culture and how Canadians both adapt to and resist these influences. This third volume describes not only the sites of popular culture-social media, video games, art, mem- ory institutions, cinema, sports, and so on-but the seeds and sparks that create these explosions of expression and creativity. But these experiences intersect with gender, social class, language, region, ethnic heritage, and age, among other factors and conditions to determine how we use and give meaning to pop- ular culture. The book raises critical issues about our uses of myths and stereo- types, how we define beauty, how we deal with our darkest visions, the role of violence in society, how culture is used both to enforce and to push the bound- aries of convention and social control and how we express our many identities. The hope is that Contexts of Popular Culture will both illuminate this complex and multi-textured landscape, and become a catalyst for research and discussion.},

@report{blaylock10_monroe_plan_corpus_,
 abstract     = {Fusion bonding is one of the three methods available for joining composite and dissimilar materials. While the other two, mechanical fastening and adhesion bonding, have been the subject of wide coverage both in textbooks and monographs, fusion bonding is covered here substantially for the first time. Fusion bonding offers a number of advantages over traditional joining techniques and it is anticipated that its use will increase dramatically in the future because of the rise in the use of thermoplastic matrix composites and the growing necessity for recyclability of engineering assemblies. Fusion Bonding of Polymer Composites provides an in-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the fusion bonding process, covering such topics as:- heat transfer in fusion bonding;- modelling thermal degradation;- consolidation mechanisms;- crystallisation kinetics;- processing-microstructure-property relationship;- full-scale fusion bonding;- fusion bonding of thermosetting composite/thermoplastic composite and metal/thermoplastic joints.The book focuses on one practical case study using the resistance welding process. This example exposes the reader to the development of processing windows for a novel manufacturing process including the use of experimental test programmes and modelling strategies.},

@inproceedings{bos10_stereot_164,
 abstract     = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of stereotypies in children with a history of early institutional care, evaluate the efficacy of a foster care intervention compared with institutional care on the course of stereotypies, and describe correlates in language, cognition, and anxiety for children who exhibit stereotypies. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Institutions in Bucharest, Romania. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-six children with a history of early institutional care. Intervention Comparison of a foster care intervention with continued care as usual in an institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of stereotypies as well as outcomes in language, cognition, and anxiety. RESULTS: At the baseline assessment prior to placement in foster care (average age of 22 months), more than 60 \% of children in institutional care exhibited stereotypies. Follow-up assessments at 30 months, 42 months, and 54 months indicated that being placed in families significantly reduced stereotypies, and with earlier and longer placements, reductions became larger. For children in the foster care group, but not in the care as usual group, stereotypies were significantly associated with lower outcomes on measures of language and cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotypies are prevalent in children with a history of institutional care. A foster care intervention appears to have a beneficial/moderating role on reducing stereotypies, underscoring the need for early placement in home-based care for abandoned children. Children who continue to exhibit stereotypies after foster care placement are significantly more impaired on outcomes of language and cognition than children without stereotypies and thus may be a target for further assessments or interventions.},

The publication of the artist Kamal Boullata's scholarly book is the first comprehensive anglophone account of what has been, and continues to be lost through Israel's systematic Judaisation of the territory and eradication or appropriation of Arab heritage. Articulating aesthetic concerns with sociohistorical commentary, Boullata traces the complex, fractured pathways of Palestinian art from the rise of Arab modernism and nationalism during the dying days of Ottoman rule in the latter half of the twentieth century, through successive occupations under the British Mandate and Israel, to the diasporas created by the Nakba of 1948. Jerusalem and Beirut emerge as once thriving cosmopolitan cities, whose modernism was advanced by the mutual influences of Christian and Islamic traditions, and to which women artists continue to make a significant contribution.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes a new language resource of events and semantic roles that characterize real-world situations. Narrative schemas contain sets of related events (edit and publish), a temporal ordering of the events (edit before publish), and the semantic roles of the participants (authors publish books). This type of world knowledge was central to early research in natural language understanding. Scripts were one of the main formalisms, representing common sequences of events that occur in the world. Unfortunately, most of this knowledge was hand-coded and time consuming to create. Current machine learning techniques, as well as a new approach to learning through coreference chains, has allowed us to automatically extract rich event structure from open domain text in the form of narrative schemas. The narrative schema resource described in this paper contains approximately 5000 unique events combined into schemas of varying sizes. We describe the resource, how it is learned, and a new evaluation of the coverage of these schemas over unseen documents},

@article{chen10_how_choic_affec_reflec_prefer_99,
 abstract     = {After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it.},

 abstract     = {RoleModel is a novel story generator organized around explicit formal models of character roles. RoleModel expands the expressiveness of stories generated from arbitrary partial domain specification by using a formal model of roles within an abductive logic programming framework. Authorial goals in the system can be fully or partially specified as constraints in an abductive logic program. In particular, the RoleModel system focuses on representing and satisfying role constraints of the story characters. This paper discusses the basic architecture for the RoleModel approach, demonstrates example output from the system through three use-cases, discusses the authorial expressiveness enabled by a stageless abductive logic approach to story generation, and proposes the current and future directions.},

Computational social science is the integrated, interdisciplinary pursuit of social inquiry with emphasis on information processing and through the medium of advanced computation. Themain computational social science areas are automated information extraction systems, social network analysis, social geographic information systems (GIS), complexity modeling, and social simulationmodels. Just like Galileo exploited the telescope as the key instrument for observing and gaining a deeper and empirically truthful understanding of the physical universe, computational social scientists are learning to exploit the advanced and increasingly powerful instruments of computation to see beyond the visible spectrum of more traditional disciplinary analyses.},

@article{de10_indig_cosmop_andes_25,
 abstract     = {In Latin America indigenous politics has been branded as "ethnic politics." Its activism is interpreted as a quest to make cultural rights prevail. Yet, what if "culture" is insufficient, even an inadequate notion, to think the challenge that indigenous politics represents? Drawing inspiration from recent political events in Peru-and to a lesser extent in Ecuador and Bolivia-where the indigenous-popular movement has conjured sentient entities (mountains, water, and soil-what we call "nature") into the public political arena, the argument in this essay is threefold. First, indigeneity, as a historical formation, exceeds the notion of politics as usual, that is, an arena populated by rational human beings disputing the power to represent others vis-{\`a}-vis the state. Second, indigeneity's current political emergence-in oppositional antimining movements in Peru and Ecuador, but also in celebratory events in Bolivia-challenges the separation of nature and culture that underpins the prevalent notion of politics and its according social contract. Third, beyond "ethnic politics" current indigenous movements, propose a different political practice, plural not because of its enactment by bodies marked by gender, race, ethnicity or sexuality (as multiculturalism would have it), but because they conjure nonhumans as actors in the political arena.},

Our findings indicate that while young African American men play video games frequently, their objectives in playing may be unlike those who enter computer scientist fields. From this we discuss implications of this study on designing CS learning interventions that leverage video games to introduce young people to computation.},

@article{dominus10_short_introd_to_topol_14,
 abstract     = {Topology is the branch of mathematics that tries to understand continuity and continuous functions. You probably don't need to know much topology for your CS degree, but people will bring it up from time to time. For example, you will hear in your category theory class that topological spaces form a category with continuous functions as the arrows. Or you will hear that certain topological spaces are natural models for intuitionistic logic. The goal of these notes is to be the minimal explanation of topology that will enable you to understand those two things. On the real line, continuity is defined in terms of distance: a function from R to R is continuous if points that were sufficiently close together in the domain are mapped to points that are close together in the codomain. The use of "close together" implies a distance function, which in R is simply |x - y|. But what about spaces that are more complex, for which distance doesn't make sense, or where no distance function is apparent? Topology reformulates this idea of "closeness" in terms of special sets called "open sets".},

@book{dyer-witheford10_games_empir_,
 abstract     = {In the first decade of the twenty-first century, video games are an integral part of global media culture, rivaling Hollywood in revenue and influence. No longer confined to a subculture of adolescent males, video games today are played by adults around the world. At the same time, video games have become major sites of corporate exploitation and military recruitment.In Games of Empire, Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter offer a radical political critique of such video games and virtual environments as Second Life, World of Warcraft, and Grand Theft Auto, analyzing them as the exemplary media of Empire, the twenty-first-century hypercapitalist complex theorized by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. The authors trace the ascent of virtual gaming, assess its impact on creators and players alike, and delineate the relationships between games and reality, body and avatar, screen and street.Games of Empire forcefully connects video games to real-world concerns about globalization, militarism, and exploitation, from the horrors of African mines and Indian e-waste sites that underlie the entire industry, the role of labor in commercial game development, and the synergy between military simulation software and the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan exemplified by Full Spectrum Warrior to the substantial virtual economies surrounding World of Warcraft, the urban neoliberalism made playable in Grand Theft Auto, and the emergence of an alternative game culture through activist games and open-source game development.Rejecting both moral panic and glib enthusiasm, Games of Empire demonstrates how virtual games crystallize the cultural, political, and economic forces of global capital, while also providing a means of resisting them.},

@article{fleming10_how_progr_debug_revis_39,
 abstract     = {Many theories of human debugging rely on complex mental constructs that offer little practical advice to builders of software engineering tools. Although hypotheses are important in debugging, a theory of navigation adds more practical value to our understanding of how programmers debug. Therefore, in this paper, we reconsider how people go about debugging in large collections of source code using a modern programming environment. We present an information foraging theory of debugging that treats programmer navigation during debugging as being analogous to a predator following scent to find prey in the wild. The theory proposes that constructs of scent and topology provide enough information to describe and predict programmer navigation during debugging, without reference to mental states such as hypotheses. We investigate the scope of our theory through an empirical study of 10 professional programmers debugging a real-world open source program. We found that the programmers' verbalizations far more often concerned scent-following than hypotheses. To evaluate the predictiveness of our theory, we created an executable model that predicted programmer navigation behavior more accurately than comparable models that did not consider information scent. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for enhancing software engineering tools.},

@book{glickstein10_writin_gnu_emacs_exten_,
 abstract     = {Yes, it is possible to be all things to all people, if you're talking about the Emacs editor. As a user, you can make any kind of customization you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever developed before. It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but fast-paced book. GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things. To provide such a broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs). GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it already provides. In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. Examples progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major modes. You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well, making learning pleasant and natural.},

It is a personal view based on my experience as a policy adviser who has recently come to ABM. I suggest that to promote the use of ABM, the ABM community needs demonstrate the value of modelling to other social scientists by showing-by-doing and offering training projects; and to produce tools, guidance on good-practice and basic building blocks. Then the policy contexts most likely to benefit from ABM need to be identified along with any new data requirements, so that the usefulness of ABM can be demonstrated to policy analysts. This is, in my view, the challenge facing the ABM community for the next 15 years. },

@article{harrell10_desig_empow_critic_ident_social_comput_gamin_6,
 abstract     = {This article presents theory and technology addressing the design of computing technologies for social computing and gaming: (1) to provide dynamic means of identity representation while avoiding stigmatising norms, and (2) to provide for critical reflection on stigmatising identity infrastructures found in other systems. The theory and technologies developed with these aims are encapsulated under the rubric of the Advanced Identity Representation (AIR) Project that initiated in the Imagination, Computation, and Expression Laboratory (ICE Lab) directed by the author. This work has a basis in the cognitive science foundations of categorisation and metaphor-based bias, and study of social classification infrastructures from sociology of science. Using this theoretical framework, this article provides a model to reveal a set of inadequacies of many current identity infrastructures in social computing and gaming systems for supporting the needs of collective groups of people and individuals in marginalised categories. As results, several social networking systems and games developed in the ICE Lab to empower users in the creative goal of constructing computational identities and/or critiquing the phenomenon of stigma in these applications are presented.

In their recent book, Nudge, 1 Richard Thaler and then Obama advisor (now head of the White House's Ofﬁce of Information and Regulatory Affairs), Cass Sunstein, suggest several ways in which government agencies and private organizations might "nudge" individuals toward actions that are better for them.2 They hope to promote libertarian paternalism as "a promising foundation for bipartisanship-a way of maintaining our ﬁrm commitment to freedom of choice while also helping people make better decisions for themselves" (p. 14). They suggest "that libertarian paternalism offers a real Third Way-one that can break through some of the least tractable debates in contemporary democracies" (p. 252/255).},

 abstract     = {Reactive agents are an important part of video games and numerous tools have emerged to facilitate the rapid construction of such agents. While the ability of the commonly used reactive techniques to express agent specifications is roughly equivalent, the authorial burden of constructing these specifications varies. In practice, this means that identical agent behavior may be more difficult to create in some architectures than others. In this paper we introduce the notion of representational complexity that relates to the authorial burden of constructing such agents and theoretically compare the representational complexity of finite state machines, behavior trees, and subsumption architectures. Our key finding is that hierarchical subsumption architectures have significantly lower representational complexity as compared to hierarchical finite state machines and behavior trees, which makes subsumption the best choice when developing authoring tools for non-expert users.},

@article{huebner10_instr_multi_agent_organ_with_20,
 abstract     = {The social and organisational aspects of agency have led to a good amount of theoretical work in terms of formal models and theories. However, the conception and engineering of proper organisational infrastructures embodying such models and theories are still an open issue. The introduction of normative concerns with requirements of openness and adaptation stresses this issue. The corresponding mechanisms for the current infrastructures appear to be not appropriate for managing distributed and open normative organisations. There is still the need of proper abstractions and tools to facilitate application agents taking part in the monitoring of the organisation on one hand, and in the adaptation and definition of the organisation in which they are situated on the other hand. In this paper we present and discuss ORA4MAS (Organisational Artifacts for Multi-Agent Systems), a proposed approach aiming at these issues. Based on the Agents and Artifacts meta-model ( A&A ), it introduces organisational artifacts as first class entities to instrument the organisation for supporting agents activities within it.},

@inproceedings{johnson10_suppor_,
 abstract     = {Many current team-based first-person-shooters (FPS) have limited communication between players. Voice chat and text are the two primary methods of communicating however, in fast paced games, this is insufficient for making sophisticated plans. Giving players more non-verbal forms of communication could reduce the time necessary to develop plans which will likely increase the number of strategic plans used in first-person-shooters. By using information visualization techniques in games, we can provide players a faster method to communicate with their teammates, allowing teams to develop more complex plans quickly. We present ways in which player communication can be improved, reducing the necessary time to make effective strategic plans and increasing the amount of cooperative play amongst teammates. Using Source, a 3D game engine developed by Valve Corporation, we plan on developing a 'mod' to incorporate changes to further enable cooperative play. Once finished, we will determine the effectiveness of each tool by gathering and analyzing data from players.},

@article{keil10_bump_bump_139,
 abstract     = {In 4 studies, the authors examined how intuitions about the relative difficulties of the sciences develop. In Study 1, familiar everyday phenomena in physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, and economics were pretested in adults, so as to be equally difficult to explain. When participants in kindergarten, Grades 2, 4, 6, and 8, and college were asked to rate the difficulty of understanding these phenomena, children revealed a strong bias to see natural science phenomena as more difficult than those in psychology. The perceived relative difficulty of economics dropped dramatically in late childhood. In Study 2, children saw neuroscience phenomena as much more difficult than cognitive psychology phenomena, which were seen as more difficult than social psychology phenomena, even though all phenomena were again equated for difficulty in adults. In Study 3, we explored the basis for these results in intuitions about common knowledge and firsthand experience. Study 4 showed that the intuitions about the differences between the disciplines were based on intuitions about difficulty of understanding and not on the basis of more general intuitions about the feasibility or truth of the phenomena in question. Taken together, in the studies, the authors find an early emerging basis for judgments that some sciences are intrinsically more difficult than others, a bias that may persevere in adults in subtler forms in such settings as the courtroom.},

@article{kessenich10_openg_shadin_languag_1,
 abstract     = {This document describes a programming language called The OpenGL Shading Language,or glslang. The recent trend in graphics hardware has been to replace fixed functionality with programmability in areas that have grown exceedingly complex (e.g., vertex processing and fragment processing). The OpenGL Shading Language has been designed to allow application programmers to express the processing that occurs at those programmable points of the OpenGL pipeline. Independently compilable units that are written in this language are called shaders.A program is a set of shaders that are compiled and linked together. The aim of this document is to thoroughly specify the programming language. The OpenGL entry points that are used to manipulate and communicate with programs and shaders are defined separately from this language specification. The OpenGL Shading Language is based on ANSI C and many of the features have been retained except when they conflict with performance or ease of implementation. C has been extended with vector and matrix types (with hardware based qualifiers) to make it more concise for the typical operations carried out in 3D graphics. Some mechanisms from C++ have also been borrowed, such as overloading functions based on argument types, and ability to declare variables where they are first needed instead of at the beginning of blocks.},

 abstract     = {Tens of millions of people today are living part of their life in a virtual world. In places like World of Warcraft, Second Life, and Free Realms, people are making friends, building communities, creating art, and making real money. Business is booming on the virtual frontier, as billions of dollars are paid in exchange for pixels on screens. But sometimes things go wrong. Virtual criminals defraud online communities in pursuit of real-world profits. People feel cheated when their avatars lose virtual property to wrongdoers. Increasingly, they turn to legal systems for solutions. But when your avatar has been robbed, what law is there to assist you? In Virtual Justice, Greg Lastowka illustrates the real legal dilemmas posed by virtual worlds. Presenting the most recent lawsuits and controversies, he explains how governments are responding to the chaos on the cyberspace frontier. After an engaging overview of the history and business models of today's virtual worlds, he explores how laws of property, jurisdiction, crime, and copyright are being adapted to pave the path of virtual law. Virtual worlds are becoming more important to society with each passing year. This pioneering study will be an invaluable guide to scholars of online communities for years to come. © 2010 by Greg Lastowka. All rights reserved.},

 abstract     = {Video games are complex, emergent systems that are difficult to design and test. This difficulty invariably leads to failures being present in the game, negatively impacting the play experience of some. We present a taxonomy of possible failures, divided into temporal and non-temporal failures. The taxonomy can guide the thinking of designers and testers alike, helping them expose bugs in the game. This will lead to games being better tested and designed, with fewer failures when released.},

We present a logic called DDLA (Deterministic Dynamic logic of Agency) which supports reasoning about actions and joint actions of agents and coalitions, and agentive and coalitional capabilities. InDDLA it is supposed that, once all agents have selected a joint action, the effect of this joint action is deterministic. In order to assessDDLAwe prove that it embeds Coalition Logic. We then extendDDLA with modal operators for agents' preferences, and show that the resulting logic is sufficiently expressive to capture the game-theoretic concepts of best response and Nash equilibrium.},

Using the abstraction of the social game, Comme il Faut creates experiences where specific dramatic interactions between characters arise from play. This paper describes the process of authoring for Comme il Faut. Specifically, we will describe the authoring and design considerations for Comme il Faut's inaugural game, The Prom. We discuss how we extracted and encoded an exaggerated social logic from pre-existing media experiences to create its intended story space, developed an idiosyncratic local culture for its story world, defined a set of character histories and personalities to be revealed through play, and authored the specific lines of dialogue and motivating social situations that give the audience experience of The Prom its particular character. Together, these produce an experience with much greater fictional specificity than in open-ended simulation games and many more options for what happens (and how things happen) than in traditional game stories.},

In this paper, we detail the workings of a major new version of our social artificial intelligence system, Comme il Faut, that enables social game play in interactive media experiences. The workings of Comme il Faut 2 are shown, with running examples, from both knowledge representation and process perspectives. Finally, the paper concludes with a plan for evaluating and demonstrating Comme il Faut 2 through an implementation of an interactive media experience that consists of a playable social space.},

However, although there have been surveys of agent AI in games, to date there has been no survey of work on team-mate AI. Furthermore, the concept of "team-mate AI" is not currently well delineated to distinguish between work on independently-acting agents that happen to be on the same side from work on agents the coordinate their behaviors and decision-making in terms of their teammates behaviors, intentions, and the like. Also, it is important to distinguish between game AI that is used as an optimization technique from real-time game AI, so this paper proposes a definition for real-time team-mate AI (highlighted with examples by game genre), reviews work to date to implement real-time team-mate AI for games in terms of a number of AI research areas (e.g., coordinated action, prediction, learning), and concludes with a brief discussion of significant issues about the state of the art.},

We have developed a framework to analyze 3D level designs based on patterns extracted from level designers and game play sessions. We then use these patterns to analyze several game play sessions. Results of this analysis reveal methods by which designers push and pull players through levels. We discuss an analysis of these patterns in terms of three level affordance configurations, combat, environmental resistance, and mixed goals in 21 different games using one walkthrough play session per game. By looking at the variety of games, we can further explore the level similarities and differences between games},

@inproceedings{murakami10_suppor_,
 abstract     = {We propose a method for the task of iden-tifying the general positions of users in online debates, i.e., support or oppose the main topic of an online debate, by ex-ploiting local information in their remarks within the debate. An online debate is a forum where each user post an opin-ion on a particular topic while other users state their positions by posting their re-marks within the debate. The supporting or opposing remarks are made by directly replying to the opinion, or indirectly to other remarks (to express local agreement or disagreement), which makes the task of identifying users' general positions diffi-cult. A prior study has shown that a link-based method, which completely ignores the content of the remarks, can achieve higher accuracy for the identification task than methods based solely on the contents of the remarks. In this paper, we show that utilizing the textual content of the remarks into the link-based method can yield higher accuracy in the identification task.},

In the human sciences, internalisation is a crucial element within the concept of norms. Internalisation distinguishes normative behaviour regulation from mere coercion. The aim of this article is to begin answering the question of to what extent normative agent architectures represent the theoretical construct of norm internalisation. The relevant research in this area may be found in socialisation research in psychology and sociology. Evaluation of conclusions from the empirical sciences allows to identify drawbacks and opportunities in existing architectures, as well as to develop suggestions for future development.},

Her dissident voice has stayed as consistent in its critique of neo.imperialist international politics as it has in its denunciation of women's oppression, both in her native Egypt and in the wider world. Saadawi is a figure of international significance, and her work has a central place in Arabic history and culture of the last half century. Featuring work never before translated into English, The Essential Nawal El Saadawi gathers together a wide range of Saadawi's writing. From novellas and short stories to essays on politics, culture, religion and sex; from extensive interviews to her work as a dramatist; from poetry to autobiography, this book is essential for anyone wishing to gain a sense of the breadth of Saadawi's work},

@article{norman10_logic_deleg_174,
 abstract     = {Delegation is a foundational concept for understanding and engineering systems that interact and execute tasks autonomously. By extending recent work on tensed action logic, it becomes possible to pin down a specific interpretation of responsibility with a well specified semantics and a convenient and intuitive logic for expression. Once descriptions of direct agent responsibility can be formed, there is a foundation upon which to characterise the dynamics of how responsibility can be acquired, transferred and discharged and, in particular, how delegation can be effected. The resulting logic, designed specifically to cater for responsibility and delegation, can then be employed to offer an axiological and semantic exploration of the related concepts of forbearance, imperatives and group communication. © 2009.},

@inproceedings{oren10_model_normat_power_,
 abstract     = {A power describes the ability of an agent to act in some way. While this notion of power is critical in the context of organisational dynamics, and has been studied by others in this light, it must be constrained so as to be useful in any practical application. In particular, we are concerned with how power may be used by agents to govern the imposition and management of norms, and how agents may dynamically assign norms to other agents within a multi-agent system. We approach the problem by defining a syntax and semantics for powers governing the creation, deletion, or modification of norms within a system, which we refer to as normative powers. We then extend this basic model to accommodate more general powers that can modify other powers within the system, and describe how agents playing certain roles are able to apply powers, changing the systems norms, and also the powers themselves. We examine how the powers found within a system may change as the status of norms change, and show how standard norm modification operations such as the derogation, annulment and modification of norms may be represented within our system.},

@inproceedings{raghunathan10_multi_pass_sieve_coref_resol_,
 abstract     = {Most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks.},

@inproceedings{rowe10_indiv_differ_gamep_learn_,
 abstract     = {Narrative-centered learning environments are an important class of educational games that situate learning within rich story contexts. The work presented in this paper investigates individual differences in gameplay and learning during student interactions with a narrative-centered learning environment, Crystal Island. Findings reveal striking differences between high- and low-achieving science students in problem-solving effectiveness, attention to particular gameplay elements, learning gains and engagement ratings. High-achieving science students tended to demonstrate greater problem-solving efficiency, reported higher levels of interest and presence in the narrative environment, and demonstrated an increased focus on information gathering and information organization gameplay activities. Lower-achieving microbiology students gravitated toward novel gameplay elements, such as conversations with non-player characters and the use of laboratory testing equipment. The findings have implications for the design of broadly effective gameplay activities for narrative-centered learning environments, as well as investigations of scaffolding techniques to promote effective problem solving, improved learning outcomes and sustained engagement for all students.},

@inproceedings{sali10_playin_words_,
 abstract     = {Dialogue systems are central to role-playing games, adventure games, interactive fictions, and some forms of interactive drama and cinema---but we have little empirical evidence about how, or even whether, the design of dialogue system interfaces shapes gameplay experience. In this paper we present the results of a study directly comparing three different dialogue system interfaces implemented over the complete course of a dramatic, story-focused game. We find that, holding the rest of the game steady, changing the dialogue interface produces significant changes in gameplay experience. Further, these changes shape perceptions of the system well beyond the interface and its operation. The changes are also sometimes resonant with, and sometimes at odds with, conventional wisdom about these interface options in the game design and writing communities. Our study compared three interfaces: a sentence selection interface (which appears to maximize story involvement), an abstract response menu interface (which maximized reasoning about the underlying game structures), and a natural language understanding interface (which maximized a sense of presence and engagement with the overall experience). Our full results provide valuable future guidance for those seeking a dialogue interface that is resonant with their gameplay experience goals.},

@article{samuels10_sound_39,
 abstract     = {A generation of scholars in multiple disciplines has investigated sound in ways that are productive for anthropologists. We introduce the concept of soundscape as a modality for integrating this work into an anthropological approach. We trace its history as a response to the technological mediations and listening practices emergent in modernity and note its absence in the anthropological literature. We then trace the history of technology that gave rise to anthropological recording practices, film sound techniques, and experimental sound art, noting productive interweavings of these threads. After considering ethnographies that explore relationships between sound, personhood, aesthetics, history, and ideology, we question sound's supposed ephemerality as a reason for the discipline's inattention. We conclude with a call for an anthropology that more seriously engages with its own history as a sounded discipline and moves forward in ways that incorporate the social and cultural sounded world more fully.},

As this approach requires a consistent structure, our concept proposes an adaption of Scrum that is based on the game development life-cycle: ABC-Sprints consist of three Sprints to iteratively create Alpha, Beta and Completed versions of a game. We present a detailed walkthrough of the course and give results of a formal evaluation. These indicate that ABC-Sprints help students to manage their workload and to increase productivity over time. Consequently, three teams each presented a game at the end of the course that tech- nically exceeded typical outcomes of game projects without lectures. We hence encourage to apply ABC-Sprints to other curricula and provide a set of recommendations.},

 abstract     = {Cooperative design has been an integral part of many games. With the success of games like Left4Dead, many game designers and producers are currently exploring the addition of cooperative patterns within their games. Unfortunately, very little research investigated cooperative patterns or methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a set of cooperative patterns identified based on analysis of fourteen cooperative games. Additionally, we propose Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPM). To evaluate the use of these CPMs, we ran a study with a total of 60 participants, grouped in 2-3 participants per session. Participants were asked to play four cooperative games (Rock Band 2, Lego Star Wars, Kameo, and Little Big Planet). Videos of the play sessions were annotated using the CPMs, which were then mapped to cooperative patterns that caused them. Results, validated through inter-rater agreement, identify several effective cooperative patterns and lessons for future cooperative game designs.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes a type-oriented approach to the programming of social middleware. It defines a collection of metamodeling features which allow programmers to declare the social entity types which make up the program of a multiagent society for some application domain. These features are identified and formalised taking into account a specification of social middleware as programmable, abstract machines. Thus, the proposed approach results in the type system of an interaction-oriented programming language. The paper uses the C+ action language and the CCalc tool as formal devices, so that metamodeling features are given formal semantics as new social law abbreviations which complement the causal law abbreviations of C+. This programming language approach contrasts with the informal modeling approach endorsed by organizational methodologies, and promotes higher levels of formality, modularity and reusability in the specification of multiagent societies.},

@book{shegog10_applic_behav_theor_comput_game_,
 abstract     = {Serious games are gaining profile as a novel strategy to impact health behavior change in the service of national health objectives. Research has indicated that many evidence-based programs are effective because they are grounded in behavioral and motivational theories and models such as the PRECEDE model, the Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Transtheoretical Model, Attribution Theory, and the ARCS model. Such theories assist in understanding health behavior problems, developing salient interventions, and evaluating their effectiveness. It follows, therefore, that serious games can be made optimally effective in changing health behavior if they are also informed by these theories. A successful intervention development framework (Intervention Mapping) provides a means to enable game developers to use theory to inform the design of effective games for health. This chapter describes useful theories and models for health game design, introduces the intervention mapping process, and describes a case study of a theory- and empirically-based serious health game intervention that has used these approaches and has been rigorously evaluated},

 abstract     = {Ubiquitous Games (UbiqGames) are browser-based multi-player games played primarily on mobile devices. UbiqGames are designed to be played outside of formal class time and over several days, alongside more traditional instruction in the topics covered in the games. Teachers can use class time to facilitate thoughtful reflection on game strategies and data generated through gameplay. In the UbiqGame Weatherlings, players collect virtual creature cards and "battle" other players in arenas based on real cities, which feature the cities' meteorological data from the recent past. Success in the game requires players to consider climate conditions and do short-term forecasting from this real weather data. In this pilot study, 20 Singaporean 10 and 11 year-olds played Weatherlings using mobile devices over four days, playing primarily outside formal class time. Survey and interview data, combined with server logs, demonstrate positive outcomes for students including strong appeal and high engagement, increased interest in weather, and self-reported improvement in weather prediction skills. Outcomes suggest opportunities for additional research around UbiqGames to probe this new model for game-centered learning.},

@book{stefanov10_javas_patter_,
 abstract     = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Quests are given to the player in the form of a set of tasks to complete with few, if any, options. The options given to the player instead often revolve around combat-oriented actions requiring the player to engage in combat to progress through the storyline, despite player preference or game story that hints otherwise. We address this issue with the GrailGM, a run-time game master which offers quests and actions to the player based on their history and current world state.},

 abstract     = {Social interactions within virtual communities are often described solely as being online experiences. Such descriptions are limited, for they fail to reference life external to the screen. The terms "virtual" and "real" have a negative connotation for many people and can even be interpreted to mean that something is "false" or "inauthentic." Research on postmodern lifestyles has questioned the relation between different dimensions of experience. This article seeks to describe how, in an online role-playing games community, the two dimensions--the real and the virtual--are interrelated and contribute to the construction of a unique, integrated personal experience that exists in the tension between everyday life and the computer world.

The first volume focused on the challenges that Canadian media and communication industries faced as they entered the first years of the twenty-first century. The second volume dealt with the impact of globalization on Canadian media and culture and how Canadians both adapt to and resist these influences. This third volume describes not only the sites of popular culture-social media, video games, art, mem- ory institutions, cinema, sports, and so on-but the seeds and sparks that create these explosions of expression and creativity. But these experiences intersect with gender, social class, language, region, ethnic heritage, and age, among other factors and conditions to determine how we use and give meaning to pop- ular culture. The book raises critical issues about our uses of myths and stereo- types, how we define beauty, how we deal with our darkest visions, the role of violence in society, how culture is used both to enforce and to push the bound- aries of convention and social control and how we express our many identities. The hope is that Contexts of Popular Culture will both illuminate this complex and multi-textured landscape, and become a catalyst for research and discussion.},

We argue that the heavy reliance on a specific notion of complexity risks rendering the concept superfluous. Furthermore we discuss what sort of systems might reasonably be understood as exhibiting emergence at all and point out that the macro-level needs to be at least min- imally structured. A worry may thus be formed that macro- level generalisations provide the sort of short-cut that is ex- plicitly excluded from WE thus potentially making the con- cept apply only to chaotic systems of limited interest (in this context).

 abstract     = {In the context of interactive, virtual experiences, the use of personality models to maintain consistent character be- haviour is becoming more widespread in both industry and academia. Most current techniques, however, are limited in one of three ways: either they overly restrict user actions, have a high cost for creating varied content, or rely on a rep- resentation that prohibits conveying complex content to the user. Toward addressing these issues, we introduce Socially Consistent Role Passing, a mechanism for ensuring consistent character behaviour that leverages the design of PaSSAGE, an existing system for generating adaptive, interactive stories. While results from previous human user studies have shown that PaSSAGE improves the enjoyment of players with lit- tle gaming experience, we present results from a new study showing that PaSSAGE's adaptive stories, augmented with Socially Consistent Role Passing, improve the enjoyment of all players versus a set of fixed-structure alternatives.},

@article{tinwell10_uncan_behav_surviv_horror_games_2,
 abstract     = {This study investigates the relationship between the perceived eeriness of a virtual character with the perception of human-likeness for some attributes of motion and sound. 100 participants were asked to rate 13 video clips of 12 different virtual characters and one human. The results indicate that attributes of motion and sound do exaggerate the uncanny phenomenon and how frightening that character is perceived to be. Strong correlations were identified for the perceived eeriness for a character with how human-like a character's voice sounded, how human-like facial expression appeared and the synchronization of the character's sound with lip movement; characters rated as the least synchronized were perceived to be the most frightening. Based on the results of this study, this paper seeks to define an initial set of hypotheses for the fear- evoking aspects of character facial rendering and vocalization in survival horror games that can be used by game designers seeking to increase the fear factor in the genre and that will form the basis of further experiments which, it is hoped, will lead to a conceptual framework for the uncanny.},

 abstract     = {Growing evidence suggests that games can be a highly effective and motivating framework for learning. Digital games are increasingly prevalent in today's classrooms, and game-based learning is emerging as a successful means of reaching students who often struggle to succeed through more traditional approaches. For example, students with autism face a unique set of challenges and goals in the context of classroom learning. Principles of well-designed games offer a powerful framework for designing new types of learning experiences for students with autism. Moreover, recent innovations in computing interfaces have also lead to new forms of socio-collaborative experiences with digital media. This article introduces our recent case study in applying game-based learning in Special Education. We will present the learning scenario goals and implementation, focusing on how this work successfully applied well-designed game principles to this context. We briefly describe our evaluation methodology and preliminary results.},

 abstract     = {The transition of personal information management (PIM) tools off the desktop to the Web presents an opportunity to augment these tools with capabilities provided by the wealth of real-time information readily available. In this paper, we describe a next-generation personal information assistance engine that lets end-users delegate to it various simple context- and activity-reactive tasks and reminders. Our system, Atomate, treats RSS/ATOM feeds from social networking and life-tracking sites as sensor streams, integrating information from such feeds into a simple unified RDF world model representing people, places and things and their time-varying states and activities. Combined with other information sources on the web, including the user's online calendar, web-based e-mail client, news feeds and messaging services, Atomate can be made to automatically carry out a variety of simple tasks for the user, ranging from context-aware filtering and messaging, to sharing and social coordination actions. Atomate's open architecture and world model easily accommodate new information sources and actions via the addition of feeds and web services. To make routine use of the system easy for non-programmers, Atomate provides a constrained-input natural language interface (CNLI) for behavior specification, and a direct-manipulation interface for inspecting and updating its world model.},

 abstract     = {Over the last few decades, comparative cognitive research has focused on the pinnacles of mental evolution, asking all-or-nothing questions such as which animals (if any) possess a theory of mind, culture, linguistic abilities, future planning, and so on. Research programs adopting this top-down perspective have often pitted one taxon against another, resulting in sharp dividing lines. Insight into the underlying mechanisms has lagged behind. A dramatic change in focus now seems to be under way, however, with increased appreciation that the basic building blocks of cognition might be shared across a wide range of species. We argue that this bottom-up perspective, which focuses on the constituent capacities underlying larger cognitive phenomena, is more in line with both neuroscience and evolutionary biology.},

@inproceedings{whitehead10_towar_procc_decor_ornam_games_,
 abstract     = {Castles, palaces, temples and cathedrals in the real world are densely decorated with ornamentation. Computer games, in contrast, usually have much less and appear Spartan in comparison. Game worlds, whether hand-made or procedural, require greater decorative ornamentation to increase their realism and beauty. Currently artists create this ornament by hand; this doesn't scale. In order to have more decorative artwork in games, procedural algorithms must be developed to generate it, for only this approach will create sufficient quantities, quickly, and at low cost. This paper justifies the importance of decorative ornamentation in computer games and provides an overview of existing research on algorithmic generation of patterns and ornamentation. A series of open research issues demonstrates the breadth of potential research that can be performed in this area. Together, these make the case that procedural decorative ornamentation is a new and interesting research subdomain within the area of procedural content generation for computer games.},
