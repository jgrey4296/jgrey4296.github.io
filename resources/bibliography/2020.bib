 abstract     = {We develop new quasi-experimental tools to measure racial discrimination, due to either racial bias or statistical discrimination, in the context of bail decisions. We show that the omitted variables bias in observational release rate comparisons can be purged by using the quasi-random assignment of judges to estimate average race-specific misconduct risk. We find that approximately two-thirds of the average release rate disparity between white and Black defendants in New York City is due to racial discrimination. We then develop a hierarchical marginal treatment effects model to study the drivers of discrimination, finding evidence of both racial bias and statistical discrimination. Outcome-based tests of racial bias therefore omit an important source of racial discrimination in bail decisions, and cannot be used to rule out all possible violations of U.S. anti-discrimination law.},

 abstract     = {Over the last few years, the use of agent-based simulations to study social systems has spread to many domains (e.g., geography, ecology, sociology, economy). These simulations aim to reproduce real life situations involving human beings and thus need to integrate complex agents to match the behavior of the simulated people. Therefore, notions such as cognition, emotions, personality, social relationships or norms have to be taken into account, but there is currently no agent architecture that could incorporate all these features and be used by the majority of modelers, including those with low levels of skills in programming. In this paper, the BEN (Behavior with Emotions and Norms) architecture is introduced to tackle this issue. It is a modular architecture based on the BDI model of cognition and featuring modules to add emotions, emotional contagion, personality, social relationships and norms to agent behavior. This architecture is integrated into the GAMA simulation platform. An application of BEN to the simulation of the evacuation of a nightclub on fire is presented and shows the complexity of behaviors that may be developed with this architecture to create credible and expressive simulations.},

 abstract     = {The dynamics of social stigma are explored in the context of diffusion models. Our focus is on exploring the dynamic process through which the behavior of individuals and the interpersonal relationships among them influence the macro-social attitude towards the stigma. We find that a norm of tolerance is best promoted when the population comprises both those whose conduct is driven by compassion for the stigmatized and those whose focus is on conforming with others in their social networks. A second finding is that less insular social networks encourage de-stigmatization when most people are compassionate, but it is instead more insularity that promotes tolerance when society is dominated by conformity.},

The results show that individuals with relatively low time discounting are consistently positioned higher in the wealth distribution. The association between time discounting and the position in the wealth distribution is significant and of the same magnitude as the association between length of education and the position in the wealth distribution, and it exists after controlling for education, school grades, income, initial wealth, parental wealth, and credit constraints. Our results are consistent with the prediction of standard life-cycle savings theory that differences in time preferences generate differences in savings behavior and thereby wealth inequality},

 abstract     = {How can economic incentives aect cultural practices? As a painful custom persisted in historical China, foot-binding targeted girls whose feet were systematically reshaped during early childhood. This paper models foot-binding as a pre-marital investment in the marriage market, investigating its history of emergence, diusion and decadence. In a segregated society where men and women have inheritable status, marriage is en-dogamy and there is no incentive for costly beauty investment. With a gender-biased shock in the elite recruitment system, meritocracy rose and men's quality distribu-tion became more dispersed than women's. In this case, foot-binding was taken up by women as a costly beauty investment to compete for high quality men, and diused from upper class to working class women with the increasing degree of meritocracy. However, since foot-binding impedes heavy labor, the adoption of foot-binding among working class women exhibits regional variation: it is highly prevalent in regions where women specialized in household handicraft which requires low physical mobility, and it is less popular in regions where women specialized in farmland work, e.g. rice cultiva-tion. Finally, foot-binding faded out following the collapse of the gender-biased elite recruitment system, increasing educational opportunities for girls, and the development of modern textile industry that replaced household handicraft production.},

As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design rationale, the model   rsquo;s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model   rsquo;s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

To this end we put forward a computational multi-agent model where agents of overlapping generations interact in a dynamically evolving social network. In the model, four distinct dimensions of individuals   rsquo; social capital: degree, centrality, heterophilous and homophilous interactions, determine their generalized trust and willingness to cooperate, altogether helping them achieve certain levels of social utility (i.e., utility from social contacts) and economic performance. We find that the stationary state of the simulated social network exhibits realistic small-world topology. We also observe that societies whose social networks are relatively frequently reconfigured, display relatively higher generalized trust, willingness to cooperate, and economic performance    ndash; at the cost of lower social utility. Similar outcomes are found for societies where social tie dissolution is relatively weakly linked to family closeness.},

 abstract     = {Multi-Level Agent-Based Modeling (ML-ABM) has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. In this paper we present LevelSpace, an extension that allows modelers to easily build ML-ABMs in the popular and widely used NetLogo language. We present the LevelSpace framework and its associated programming primitives. Based on three common use-cases of ML-ABM    ndash; coupling of heterogeneous models, dynamic adaptation of detail, and cross-level interaction - we show how easy it is to build ML-ABMs with LevelSpace. We argue that it is important to have a unified conceptual language for describing LevelSpace models, and present six dimensions along which models can differ, and discuss how these can be combined into a variety of ML-ABM types in LevelSpace. Finally, we argue that future work should explore the relationships between these six dimensions, and how different configurations of them might be more or less appropriate for particular modeling tasks.},

 abstract     = {The recent advancement of agent-based modeling is characterized by higher demands on the parameterization, evaluation and documentation of these computationally expensive models. Accordingly, there is also a growing request for ``easy to go'' applications just mimicking the input-output behavior of such models. Metamodels are being increasingly used for these tasks. In this paper, we provide an overview of common metamodel types and the purposes of their usage in an agent-based modeling context. To guide modelers in the selection and application of metamodels for their own needs, we further assessed their implementation effort and performance. We performed a literature research in January 2019 using four different databases. Five different terms paraphrasing metamodels (approximation, emulator, meta-model, metamodel and surrogate) were used to capture the whole range of relevant literature in all disciplines. All metamodel applications found were then categorized into specific metamodel types and rated by different junior and senior researches from varying disciplines (including forest sciences, landscape ecology, or economics) regarding the implementation effort and performance. Specifically, we captured the metamodel performance according to (i) the consideration of uncertainties, (ii) the suitability assessment provided by the authors for the particular purpose, and (iii) the number of valuation criteria provided for suitability assessment. We selected 40 distinct metamodel applications from studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2005 to 2019. These were used for the sensitivity analysis, calibration and upscaling of agent-based models, as well to mimic their prediction for different scenarios. This review provides information about the most applicable metamodel types for each purpose and forms a first guidance for the implementation and validation of metamodels for agent-based models.},

 abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a dramatic loss of lives worldwide, challenging the sustainability of our health care systems, threatening economic meltdown, and putting pressure on the mental health of individuals (due to social distancing and lock-down measures). The pandemic is also posing severe challenges to the scientific community, with scholars under pressure to respond to policymakers   rsquo; demands for advice despite the absence of adequate, trusted data. Understanding the pandemic requires fine-grained data representing specific local conditions and the social reactions of individuals. While experts have built simulation models to estimate disease trajectories that may be enough to guide decision-makers to formulate policy measures to limit the epidemic, they do not cover the full behavioural and social complexity of societies under pandemic crisis. Modelling that has such a large potential impact upon people   rsquo;s lives is a great responsibility. This paper calls on the scientific community to improve the transparency, access, and rigour of their models. It also calls on stakeholders to improve the rapidity with which data from trusted sources are released to the community (in a fully responsible manner). Responding to the pandemic is a stress test of our collaborative capacity and the social/economic value of research.},
