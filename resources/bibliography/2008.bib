 abstract     = {Call graphs depict the static, caller-callee relation between "functions " in a program. With most source/target languages supporting functions as the primitive unit of composition, call graphs naturally form the fundamental control flow representation available to understand/develop software. They are also the substrate on which various inter- procedural analyses are performed and are integral part of program comprehension/testing. Given their universality and usefulness, it is imperative to ask if call graphs exhibit any intrinsic graph theoretic features - across versions, program domains and source languages. This work is an attempt to answer these questions: we present and investigate a set of meaningful graph measures that help us understand call graphs better; we establish how these measures correlate, if any, across different languages and program domains; we also assess the overall, language independent software quality by suitably interpreting these measures.},

We provide a survey of relevant concepts from the A-life and new media research communities, and we establish threads of commonalities with the HCI research community and especially the subset of that community that emphasizes aspects of user experience other than those that are characterized by performance-based measures. We describe and discuss several exemplar A-life artworks that are drawn from the last decade of jury selections of the annual Vida Art and Artificial Life Competition, conducted by Fundación Telefonica. We conclude with a discussion of issues that are common to the A-life and HCI research communities.},

 abstract     = {Collective intelligence is a group of agents acting as a single cognitive unit to solve problems, make decisions, and carry out other complex tasks. Collective intelligence emerges from local interactions among a large number of individuals, none of whom acts as a leader or central controller. Although especially well-described in the social insects, it is found throughout the natural world, from the complex behavior of bacterial communities to the coordinated motion of fish schools and bird flocks. These biological examples have in turn inspired engineers to develop artificial robot collectives and decentralized computational algorithms. },

@article{bennett08_gover_civil_evolut_insur,
 abstract     = {This paper models the early dynamics of insurgency using an agent-based computer simulation of civilians, insurgents, and soldiers. In the simulation, insurgents choose to attack government forces, which then strike back. Such government counterattacks may result in the capture or killing of insurgents, may make nearby civilians afraid to become insurgents, but may also increase the anger of surrounding civilians if there is significant collateral damage. If civilians become angry enough, they become new insurgents. I simulate the dynamics of these interactions, focusing on the effectiveness of government forces at capturing insurgents vs. their accuracy in avoiding collateral damage. The simulations suggest that accuracy (avoidance of collateral damage) is more important for the long-term defeat of insurgency than is effectiveness at capturing insurgents in any given counterattack. There also may be a critical 'tipping point' for accuracy below which the length of insurgencies increases dramatically. The dynamics of how insurgencies grow or decline in response to various combinations of government accuracy and effectiveness illustrate the tradeoffs faced by governments in dealing with the early stages of an insurgency.},

We evaluate the performance of the incremental engine on a benchmark problem assessing the speedup of incremental processing in the case of as-long-as-possible type of rule applications.},

@article{bryson08_embod_versus_memet,
 abstract     = {The term embodiment identifies a theory that meaning and semantics cannot be captured by abstract, logical systems, but are dependent on an agent's experience derived from being situated in an environment. This theory has recently received a great deal of support in the cognitive science literature and is having significant impact in artificial intelligence. Memetics refers to the theory that knowledge and ideas can evolve more or less independently of their human-agent substrates. While humans provide the medium for this evolution, memetics holds that ideas can be developed without human comprehension or deliberate interference. Both theories have profound implications for the study of language-its potential use by machines, its acquisition by children and of particular relevance to this special issue, its evolution. This article links the theory of memetics to the established literature on semantic space, then examines the extent to which these memetic mechanisms might account for language independently of embodiment. It then seeks to explain the evolution of language through uniquely human cognitive capacities which facilitate memetic evolution.},

Nevertheless, despite several seemingly valid attempts, there is currently no evidence that chimpanzees understand false beliefs. Our conclusion for the moment is, thus, that chimpanzees understand others in terms of a perception-goal psychology, as opposed to a full-fledged, human-like belief-desire psychology.},

Although the optic tectum (OT) has been causally implicated in stimulus selection, how it computes the strongest stimulus is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that OT neurons in the barn owl systematically encode the relative strengths of simultaneously occurring stimuli independently of sensory modality. Moreover, special "switch-like" responses of a subset of neurons abruptly increase when the stimulus inside their receptive field becomes the strongest one. Such responses are not predicted by responses to single stimuli and, indeed, are eliminated in the absence of competitive interactions. We demonstrate that this sensory transformation substantially boosts the representation of the strongest stimulus by creating a binary discrimination signal, thereby setting the stage for potential winner-take-all target selection for gaze and attention.},

We introduce an intuitive and exible modeling framework in which a user can create a street network from scratch or modify an existing street network. This is achieved through designing an underlying tensor eld and editing the graph representing the street network. The framework is intuitive because it uses tensor elds to guide the generation of a street network. The framework is exible because it allows the user to combine various global and local modeling operations such as brush strokes, smoothing, constraints, noise and rotation elds. Our results will show street networks and three-dimensional urban geometry of high visual quality.},

@book{crockford08_javas,
 abstract     = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

@article{darity08_forty_acres_mule_centur,
 abstract     = {In general, a program of reparations is intended to achieve three objectives: acknowledgment of a grievous injustice, redress for the injustice, and closure of the grievances held by the group subjected to the injustice. Three types of injustices motivate a program of reparations for black Americans: slavery, the nearly century-long Jim Crow regime following Reconstruction, and ongoing discrimination. Inauguration of a reparations program on behalf of black Americans preferably will be undertaken via legislative action at the federal level, rather than by judicial fiat. Logistical issues addressed in the article include determination of the magnitude of the reparations bill and the criteria to be used to identify those eligible to receive reparations. The present day value of 40 acres and a mule can provide the foundation for the calculation of the magnitude of reparations owed to black Americans. Three objectives can be ascribed to a program of reparations: acknowl-edgment, redress, and closure. Acknowledgment refers to the public rec-ognition of a grievous injustice committed by the institution or group that bears responsibility for it. This includes a formal apology. No such apology ever has been made by an official entity of the U.S. federal government either for slavery or for the Jim Crow practices that followed slavery within the nation's borders. In contrast, Benin-once Dahomey-an African na-tion with a population of less than 5 million people has made an apology to African Americans for their ancestors' participation in the sale of other Africans into slavery. The apology was delivered in 2003 by Benin's am-bassador, Cyrille Ogcien (Associated Press, 2003). A more encouraging sign in the United States is the series of apologies for slavery and legal segregation issued by state legislatures, including those in Alabama,},

The focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms. In this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, and realistic input models have been added.},

 abstract     = {There are many algorithm texts that provide lots of well-polished code and proofs of correctness. This book is not one of them. Instead, this book presents insights, notations, and analogies to help the novice describe and think about algorithms like an expert. By looking at both the big picture and easy step-by-step methods for developing algorithms, the author helps students avoid the common pitfalls. He stresses paradigms such as loop invariants and recursion to unify a huge range of algorithms into a few meta-algorithms. Part of the goal is to teach the students to think abstractly. Without getting bogged with formal proofs, the book fosters a deeper understanding of how and why each algorithm works. These insights are presented in a slow and clear manner accessible to second- or third-year students of computer science, preparing them to find their own innovative ways to solve problems.},

The first tool, gringo, is a grounder capable of translating logic pro- grams provided by users into equivalent propositional logic programs. The answer sets of such programs can be computed by clasp, which is a solver. The third tool, clingo, integrates the functionalities of gringo and clasp, thus, acting as a monolithic solver for user programs. Finally, iclingo extends clingo by an incremental mode that incorporates both grounding and solving. For one, this document aims at enabling ASP novices to make use of the aforementioned tools. For another, it provides a reference of their features that ASP adepts might be tempted to exploit.},

 abstract     = {Counterfactuals are thoughts about alternatives to past events, that is, thoughts of what might have been. This article provides an updated account of the functional theory of counterfactual thinking, suggesting that such thoughts are best explained in terms of their role in behavior regulation and performance improvement. The article reviews a wide range of cognitive experiments indicating that counterfactual thoughts may influence behavior by either of two routes: a content-specific pathway (which involves specific informational effects on behavioral intentions, which then influence behavior) and a content-neutral pathway (which involves indirect effects via affect, mind-sets, or motivation). The functional theory is particularly useful in organizing recent findings regarding counterfactual thinking and mental health. The article concludes by considering the connections to other theoretical conceptions, especially recent advances in goal cognition.},

@article{ferm08_playin_to_teach_music_embod,
 abstract     = {Musikdidaktik is a central subject within music teacher training in the Nordic countries. In musikdidaktik acts of teaching (music) and learning (musikdidaktik) constitute possibilities for identity formation. The objective of learning is closely connected to their future profession, in which musical and educational competences are blended, combined and used in different ways. The study presented in this article was based on a phenomenological way of thinking about education as an arena for identity development. Students' identity formation in relation to their education in musikdidaktik was investigated. In an interview study where seven musikdidaktik professors and three groups of music teacher trainees participated, the following questions were asked from a phenomenological perspective: How can education in musikdidaktik function as an arena for identity formation? What constitutes processes of music teacher trainees' identity formation? What connections can be seen between ways of teaching musikdidaktik and identity? What competences (are expected to) develop during the processes and how are they connected to employability? The results show that trainee identity formation processes can be communicated. It became evident that awareness of and reflections upon one's own experiences, learning, goals and identity development are important issues in the trainees' identity formation processes. That the trainees had the possibilities to try to act as music teachers proved to be important. When it comes to the challenges for the professor, they are primarily concerned with handling situations in a way that encourages the growth of the trainees, but also challenges them to reflect; and to be a role model, but also to offer them meetings with different role models. The competences that the trainees develop are combined in different ways within the trainees' identity formation. Musikdidaktik constitutes an arena where the students should have the opportunity to be in the world as music teachers through playing to teach music.},

According to the GCM organizations are conceptualized as crossroads of time-dependent flows of four distinct classes of objects: 'participants,' 'opportunities,' 'solutions' and 'problems.' Collisions among the different objects generate events called 'decisions.' In this paper we use NetLogo to build an explicit agent-based representation of the original GCM. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to validate and extend some of the most interesting conclusions of the GCM. We show that our representation is able to reproduce a number of properties of the original model. Yet, unlike the original model, in our representation these properties are not encoded explicitly, but emerge from general principles of the Garbage Can decision processes.},

Qualitative analysis among young men aged eighteen to twenty-six in Canberra, Australia, documents the homosocial organization of men's heterosexual relations. Homosociality organizes men's sociosexual relations in at least four ways. For some of these young men, male-male friendships take priority over male-female relations, and platonic friendships with women are dangerously feminizing. Sexual activity is a key path to masculine status, and other men are the audience, always imagined and sometimes real, for one's sexual activities. Heterosexual sex itself can be the medium through which male bonding is enacted. Last, men's sexual storytelling is shaped by homosocial masculine cultures. While these patterns were evident particularly among young men in the highly homosocial culture of a military academy, their presence also among other groups suggests the wider influence of homosociality on men's},

 abstract     = {Artificial intelligence in games is typically used for creating player's opponents. Manual edition of intelligent behaviors for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) of games is a cumbersome task that needs experienced designers. Our research aims to assist designers in this task. Behaviours typically use recurring patterns, so that experience and reuse are crucial aspects for behavior design. The use of hierarchical state machines allows working on different abstraction levels, sharing transi- tions and reusing pieces from the more detailed levels. How- ever, the static nature of the design process does not release the designer from the burden to completely specify each be- haviour. Our approach applies Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques to retrieve and reuse stored behaviors represented as hierarchical state machines (actually, behaviour trees). In this paper we focus on dynamic retrieval of behaviours tak- ing into account the world state and the underlying goals to select the most appropriate state machine to guide the NPC behaviour. The global behaviour of the NPC is dynamically built in run time querying the CBR system. We exemplify our approach through a serious game, developed by our research group, with gameplay elements from First-Person Shooter (FPS) games.},

 abstract     = {Abstract Software agents' ability to interact within different open systems, designed by different groups, presupposes an agreement on an unambiguous definition of a set of concepts, used to describe the context of the interaction and the communication language the agents can use. Agents' interactions ought to allow for reliable expectations on the possible evolution of the system; however, in open systems interacting agents may not conform to predefined specifications. A possible solution is to define interaction environments including a normative component, with suitable rules to regulate the behaviour of agents. To tackle this problem we propose an application-independent metamodel of artificial institutions that can be used to define open multiagent systems. In our view an artificial institution is made up by an ontology that models the social context of the interaction, a set of authorizations to act on the institutional context, a set of linguistic conventions for the performance of institutional actions and a system of norms that are necessary to constrain the agents' actions.},

The problems we are trying to solve in this field range from behavioral phenomena of interlimb coordination and coordination between stimuli and movements (perception-action tasks) through neural activation patterns that can be observed during these tasks to clinical applications and social behavior. It is not surprising that close collaboration among scientists from different fields as psychology, kinesiology, neurology and even physics are imperative to deal with the enormous difficulties we are facing when we try to understand a system as complex as the human brain.The chapters in this volume are not simply write-ups of the lectures given by the experts at the meeting but are written in a way that they give sufficient introductory information to be comprehensible and useful for all interested scientists and students.},

Our background is Kanger-Lindahl-Pörn account of organised interaction, which describes this interaction within a multi-modal logical setting. This work focuses in particular on the notions of counts-as link and on those of attempt and of personal and direct action to realise states of affairs. We show how standard defeasible logic (DL) can be extended to represent these concepts: the resulting system preserves some basic properties commonly attributed to them. In addition, the framework enjoys nice computational properties, as it turns out that the extension of any theory can be computed in time linear to the size of the theory itself.},

 abstract     = {Agriculture, horticulture, fishery and forestry are nature-related sectors that interact frequently with natural systems. This interaction represents a source of enforcement problems and transaction costs in the context of governing transactions. Institutional analytical frameworks used in agricultural economics should consider the particular properties of transactions involving natural systems. For ordering nature-related transactions, we propose a heuristic framework based on two dimensions: 'modularity and decomposability of structures' and 'functional interdependence of processes'. It serves as a starting point for establishing a typology ranging from 'atomistic-isolated transactions' to 'complex-interconnected transactions'. The complex process of institutionalising such transactions is decomposed into conceptual categories by means of a 'transaction-interdependence cycle'.},

 abstract     = {Traditionally, the most commonly used source of bibliometric data is Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge, in particular the Web of Science and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which provide the yearly Journal Impact Factors (JIF). This paper presents an alternative source of data (Google Scholar, GS) as well as 3 alternatives to the JIF to assess journal impact (h-index, g-index and the number of citations per paper). Because of its broader range of data sources, the use of GS gen- erally results in more comprehensive citation coverage in the area of management and international business. The use of GS particularly benefits academics publishing in sources that are not (well) cov- ered in ISI. Among these are books, conference papers, non-US journals, and in general journals in the field of strategy and international business. The 3 alternative GS-based metrics showed strong correlations with the traditional JIF. As such, they provide academics and universities committed to JIFs with a good alternative for journals that are not ISI-indexed. However, we argue that these metrics provide additional advantages over the JIF and that the free availability of GS allows for a democratization of citation analysis as it provides every academic access to citation data regardless of their institution's financial means.},

@article{herzeel08_reflec_masses,
 abstract     = {A reflective programming language provides means to render explicit what is typically abstracted away in its language constructs in an on-demand style. In the early 1980s, Brian Smith introduced a general recipe for building reflective programming languages with the notion of procedural reflection. It is an excellent framework for understanding and comparing various metaprogramming and reflective approaches, including macro programming, first-class environments, first-class continuations, metaobject protocols, aspect-oriented programming, and so on. Unfortunately, the existing literature of Brian Smiths original account of procedural reflection is hard to understand: It is based on terminology derived from philosophy rather than computer science, and takes concepts for granted that are hard to reconstruct without intimate knowledge of historical Lisp dialects from the 1960s and 1970s. We attempt to untangle Smiths original account of procedural reflection and make it accessible to a new and wider audience. On the other hand, we then use its terminological framework to analyze other metaprogramming and reflective approaches, especially those that came afterwards.},

According to the author, "a quest is a journey across a symbolic, fantastic landscape in which a protagonist or player collects objects and talks to characters in order to overcome challenges and achieve a meaningful goal." For example, Mario is on a quest to save the princess in Super Mario Brothers. This unique take on quests brings together literary and New Media theorizations of the quest in a way that can allow designers to create better games. It shows how quests can be a bridge between seemingly opposed ideas, including game and narrative, gaming and literature, technology and mythology, and meaning and action. The book deals with both the theory and the practice of the four main aspects of quests: spaces, objects, actors and challenges. Each practical section contains accompanying exercises and suggestions useful for designing quests.},

 abstract     = {Abstract This article introduces a new theory of intention representation which is based on a structure called a Dynamic Intention Structure (DIS). The theory of DISs was motivated by the problem of how to properly represent incompletely specified intentions and their evolution. Since the plans and intentions of collaborating agents are most often elaborated incrementally and jointly, elaboration processes naturally involve agreements among agents on the identity of appropriate agents, objects and properties that figure into their joint plans. The paper builds on ideas from dynamic logic to present a solution to the representation and evolution of agent intentions involving reference to incompletely specified and, possibly, mutually dependent intentions, as well as the objects referenced within those intentions. It provides a first order semantics for the resulting logic. A companion paper extends further the logical form of DISs and explores the problem of logical consequence and intention revision.},

 abstract     = {Dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by antipsychotic drugs has been measured with positron emission tomography (PET) by comparing the binding potential (BP) values before and after drug administration. This occupancy has been found to be related to clinical effects and side effects. In this study, we evaluated the uncertainty of the quantitative analysis for estimating the dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by antipsychotics in simulation and human studies of [(11)C]raclopride and for the high affinity ligand [(11)C]FLB 457. Time-activity curves of [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457 were simulated, and the reliability of BP estimated by a simplified reference tissue model and the calculated occupancy were investigated for various noise levels, BP values, and scan durations. Then, in the human PET study with and without antipsychotics, the uncertainty of BP and occupancy estimates and the scan duration required for a reliable estimation were investigated by a bootstrap approach. Reliable and unbiased estimates of [(11)C]raclopride BP(ND) could be obtained with recording as short as 32 min, with the relative standard deviation (SD) of the striatal occupancy remaining less than 10 %. Conversely, in [(11)C]FLB 457 studies, the mean value increased and SD of the temporal cortex and thalamus exceeded 10 % when the scan duration was shorter than 60 min. These results demonstrated that dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy by antipsychotics can be estimated precisely with an optimal scan duration with [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457.},

@inbook{izquierdo08_dynam_bush_mostel_learn_algor_games,
 abstract     = {Reinforcement learners interact with their environment and use their experience to choose or avoid certain actions based on the observed consequences. Actions that led to satisfactory outcomes (i.e. outcomes that met or exceeded aspirations) in the past tend to be repeated in the future, whereas choices that led to unsatisfactory experiences are avoided. The empirical study of reinforcement learning dates back to Thorndike's animal experiments on instrumental learning at the end of the 19th century (Thorndike, 1898). The results of these experiments were formalised in the well known `Law of Effect', which is nowadays one of the most robust properties of learning in the experimental psychology literature:``Of several responses made to the same situation those which are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the animal will, other things being equal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, they will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed by discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their connections to the situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will be less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond.'' (Thorndike, 1911, p. 244)Nowadays there is little doubt that reinforcement learning is an important aspect of much learning in most animal species, including many phylogenetically very distant from vertebrates (e.g. earthworms (Maier & Schneirla, 1964) and fruit flies (Wustmann, 1996)). Thus, it is not surprising that reinforcement learning --being one of the most widespread adaptation mechanisms in nature-- has attracted the attention of many scientists and engineers for decades. This interest has led to the formulation of various models of reinforcement learning and --when feasible-- to the theoretical analysis of their dynamics. In particular, this chapter characterises the dynamics of one of the best known stochastic models of reinforcement learning (Bush & Mosteller, 1955) when applied to decision problems of strategy (i.e. games).},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates issues related to the use of mobile phones by people aged 60 years and over and characteristics of an ageing-friendly mobile phone. This study combines qualitative and quantitative analysis methods of Delphi interviews, focus group discussions, and online survey. The expert interviews and the focus group discussions covered usage patterns, problems, benefits, and desired and unwanted features. The issues raised in the discussions were translated into an online survey of 100 people. This study revealed that older people are passive users of mobile phones, that they experience fear of consequences of using unfamiliar technology, and that most preferred design features are aids for declining functional abilities. Gender differences in preferred design features were observed, with women focusing on haptic aids and men on perceptual aids. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We first introduce the narrative paradox between interactivity and narrative content in virtual environments and consider its impact on game design and development. We then introduce the concept of the Emergent Narrative (EN) and the particular philosophy it has been developed upon. Finally, we describe an authoring process for this approach that reflects on the characteristics of interacting within such a narrative framework.},

@mastersthesis{milner08_fallout_fans,
 abstract     = {This study investigated how fans and producers of media texts negotiate text integrity, which is defined as an ideal about the validity, wholeness, and truth of the text. An evaluation of previous research in fan studies revealed four essential issues underlying fan-producer interaction. These four issues led to the study's four research questions, which centered on fan perceptions of ownership of a text, construction of status-relationship between fans and producers, construction of status-relationship among fans, and how fans envisioned their labor contribution to the game development process. Research questions were addressed using a discourse analysis of the forum interactions of fans of the digital-game series Fallout. The investigation focused on fan and producer interaction surrounding the release of the controversial next installment in the Fallout series, Fallout 3. Using previous literature and data gathered, the study proposed a model for fan-producer negotiation over text integrity that can be applied to fan-producer interaction in multiple contexts.},

@article{mohr08_how_to_model_instit,
 abstract     = {Institutions are linkage mechanisms that bridge across three kinds of social divides - they link micro systems of social interaction to meso (and macro) levels of organization, they connect the symbolic with the material, and the agentic with the structural. Two key analytic principles are identified for empirical research, relationality and duality. These are linked to new research strategies for the study of institutions that draw on network analytic techniques. Two hypotheses are suggested. (1) Institutional resilience is directly correlated to the overall degree of structural linkages that bridge across domains of level, meaning, and agency. (2) Institutional change is related to over-bridging, defined as the sustained juxtaposition of multiple styles within the same institutional site. Case examples are used to test these contentions. Institutional stability is examined in the case of Indian caste systems and American academic science. Institutional change is explored in the case of the rise of the early Christian church and in the origins of rock and roll music.},

@article{neumann08_homo_socion,
 abstract     = {This paper describes a survey of normative agent-based social simulation models. These models are examined from the perspective of the foundations of social theory. Agent-based modelling contributes to the research program of methodological individualism. Norms are a central concept in the role theoretic concept of action in the tradition of Durkheim and Parsons. This paper investigates to what extend normative agent-based models are able to capture the role theoretic concept of norms. Three methodological core problems are identified: the question of norm transmission, normative transformation of agents and what kind of analysis the models contribute. It can be shown that initially the models appeared only to address some of these problems rather than all of them simultaneously. More recent developments, however, show progress in that direction. However, the degree of resolution of intra agent processes remains too low for a comprehensive understanding of normative behaviour regulation.},

 abstract     = {A meta-analysis of 41 studies examined the effect of choice on intrinsic motivation and related outcomes in a variety of settings with both child and adult samples. Results indicated that providing choice enhanced intrinsic motivation, effort, task performance, and perceived competence, among other outcomes. Moderator tests revealed the effect of choice on intrinsic motivation was stronger (a) for instructionally irrelevant choices compared to choices made between activities, versions of a task, rewards, and instructionally relevant options, (b) when 2 to 4 successive choices were given, (c) when rewards were not given after the choice manipulation, (d) when participants given choice were compared to the most controlling forms of control groups, (e) for children compared to adults, (f) for designs that yoked choice and control conditions compared to matched designs in which choice was reduced or designs in which nonyoked, nonmatched controls were used, and (g) when the experiment was conducted in a laboratory embedded in a natural setting. Implications for future research and applications to real-world settings are discussed.},

 abstract     = {Video games are varied, with vastly different visual layouts and interaction styles; however, most games that share a common genre still have many user interface similarities. These similarities suggest that genres can be used as a conceptual framework for examining design issues in video games, and for developing a deeper understanding of how the design process can be specialized for specific types of games. In this paper, we consider how genre relates to one aspect of design---the usability of games, which deals with players' ability to learn, control, and understand a game interface. We report results from a study where we coded usability problems in reviews of 108 commercial video games. The review set included 18 games from each of six major game genres. We statistically analyzed the problems from each genre, and found significant differences between many of the genres. We present usability profiles for each genre based on the problem distributions that we found. The profiles describe both common and infrequent problems in each genre and provide details on how they commonly occur in games. The profiles can be used to specialize usability evaluations by helping designers focus on common problems seen in games from each genre.},

 abstract     = {Modern computer systems have the ability to make the storytelling experience interactive by involving a participant or learner as a character in the narrative itself. We present a framework for creating interactive narratives for entertainment, educational, and training purposes based on a type of agent called an experience manager. An experience manager (a generalization of a drama manager) is an intelligent computer agent that manipulates a virtual world to coerce a participant's experience to conform to a set of provided properties. Our realization of the experience manager automatically generates narrative content in order to adapt to the user's actions in the virtual world. The experience management framework has been used to develop an interactive version of Little Red Riding Hood and an interactive practice environment called IN-TALE for educating and training cognitive skills such as situation awareness, cultural awareness, leadership, and decisionmaking.},

Based on the ubiquitous Java, it provides an alternative to daunting languages and expensive proprietary software. This book gives graphic designers, artists and illustrators of all stripes a jump start to working with processing by providing detailed information on the basic principles of programming with the language, followed by careful, step-by-step explanations of select advanced techniques.The author teaches computer graphics at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, and his book has been developed with a supportive learning experience at its core. From algorithms and data mining to rendering and debugging, it teaches object-oriented programming from the ground up within the fascinating context of interactive visual media. Previously announced as "Pixels, Patterns, and Processing".*A guided journey from the very basics of computer programming through to creating custom interactive 3D graphics*Step-by-step examples, approachable language, exercises, and LOTS of sample code support the reader's learning curve*Includes lessons on how to program live video, animated images and interactive sound},

 abstract     = {This volume helps take some of the "mystery" out of identifying and dealing with key algorithms. Drawing heavily on the author's own real-world experiences, the book stresses design and analysis. Coverage is divided into two parts, the first being a general guide to techniques for the design and analysis of computer algorithms. The second is a reference section, which includes a catalog of the 75 most important algorithmic problems. By browsing this catalog, readers can quickly identify what the problem they have encountered is called, what is known about it, and how they should proceed if they need to solve it. This book is ideal for the working professional who uses algorithms on a daily basis and has need for a handy reference. This work can also readily be used in an upper-division course or as a student reference guide.THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL comes with a CD-ROM that contains: a complete hypertext version of the full printed book. the source code and URLs for all cited implementations. over 30 hours of audio lectures on the design and analysis of algorithms are provided, all keyed to on-line lecture notes.},

 abstract     = {Interactive storytelling is an interesting cross-disciplinary area that has importance in research as well as entertainment. In this paper we explore a new area of interactive storytelling that blurs the line between traditional interactive fiction and collaborative writing. We present a system where the user and computer take turns in writing sentences of a fictional narrative. Sentences contributed by the computer are selected from a collection of millions of stories extracted from Internet weblogs. By leveraging the large amounts of personal narrative content available on the web, we show that even with a simple approach our system can produce compelling stories with our users.},

@book{sweetser08_emerg_games,
 abstract     = {Emergence in games is a topic that has garnered much debate in recent years. Developers and players speculate that it would be fantastic if we could achieve gameplay that is open and natural, where players can choose their own strategies and the gameplay is limited only by the player's imagination and creativity. In recent years, games have taken steps toward this fantasy with emergent interactions made possible by Valve's Source engine and the availability of advanced physics middleware, as well as emergent gameplay achieved in games such as The Sims and SimCity. However, developers quickly realize the trade-off between emergence and design. Giving the players control has meant letting go of their own. Despite all the recent attention, the concept of emergence is still quite ambiguous and undefined in games. Many people think it would be great to have emergent gameplay, but what does this mean and how do game developers achieve it? Throughout this book, I define emergence and examine the concept from various perspectives. I also provide many ideas and examples of how to incorporate emergence into current games. This book aims to serve as food for thought and a starting place for growing a wealth of knowledge, understanding, research, and applications for emergence in games. The future of game development lies in more open, interactive, and emergent gameplay. The future starts now.},

Motivated by realtime human performance and modular architectural principles, the architecture is full-duplex ( â? open-micâ?); prosody is continuously analyzed and used for mixed-control turntaking behaviors (reactive and deliberative) and incremental utterance production. The architecture is fine-grain and highly expandable; we are currently applying it in more complex multimodal interaction and dynamic task environments. We describe here the theoretical underpinnings behind the architecture, compare it to prior efforts, discuss the methodology and give a brief overview of its current runtime characteristics.},

@article{tychsen08_charac_play_use_game_charac,
 abstract     = {Avatars are a commonly used mechanism for representing the player within the world of a game. The avatar forms the main point of interaction between the player and the game, and thus the avatar is an important game design feature. Character-based games combine the concept of an avatar with that of a character, enhancing the avatar with specific features that commonly are changeable, and which can be defined within or outside the framework of the game rules. Within digital games, the rules-based features have received comparatively more attention than, for example, the personalities and background histories of game characters. This article presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of the way complex game characters are utilized by players in multiplayer role-playing games across two different media platforms. The results indicate that adult players are capable of comprehending and utilizing game characters with well-defined personalities and backgrounds, as well as rules-based components. Furthermore, that the game format plays a significant role in the pattern of usage of the character elements. This pattern appears directly linked with variations in the way that the different game formats handle player characters and activate or promote the activation of, different forms of character elements. The degree to which different character elements are activated also has implications for the degree of player engagement in the character.},

However, when looking at robots they are still far behind even a small child in terms of their performance capabilities. Even a sophisticated robot, such as ASIMO, is limited to mostly pre-programmed behaviours (Weigmann, 2006). The reliance on robots that must be carefully programmed and calibrated before use and thereafter whenever the task changes, is quite unacceptable for robots that have to coexist and cooperate with humans, especially those who are not necessarily knowledgeable about robotics. Therefore there is an increasing need to go beyond robots that are pre-programmed explicitly towards those that learn and are adaptive (Wermter, Weber \& Elshaw, 2004; Wermter, Weber, Elshaw, Panchev et al., 2004). Natural, dynamic environments require robots to adapt their behaviour and learn using approaches typically used by animals or humans...},
