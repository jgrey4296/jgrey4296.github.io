 abstract     = {The idea of planning and plan execution is just an intuition based decomposition. There is no reason it has to be that way. Most likely in the long term, real empirical evidence from systems we know to be built that way (from designing them like that) will determine whether its a very good idea or not. Any particular planner is simply an abstraction barrier. Below that level we get a choice of whether to slot in another planner or to place a program which does the right thing. Why stop there? Maybe we can go up the hierarchy and eliminate the planners there too. To do this we must move from a state based way of reasoning to a process based way of acting.},

 abstract     = {Clean is an experimental language for specifying functional computations in terms of graph rewriting. It is based on an extension of Term Rewriting Systems (TRS) in which the terms are replaced by graphs. Such a Graph Rewriting System (GRS) consists of a, possibly cyclic, directed graph, called the data graph and graph rewrite rules which specify how this data graph may be rewritten. Clean is designed to provide a firm base for functional programming. In particular, Clean is suitable as an intermediate language between functional languages and (parallel) target machine architectures. A sequential implementation of Clean on a conventional machine is described and its performance is compared with other systems. The results show that Clean can be efficiently implemented.},

Their combined impact was to modify qualitatively the nature of global interactions between Russia and the West. No less perturbative were the changes wrought in all of academic research and in applied science. On a less grand scale these events brought about a renascence of a mathematical technique known to the old guard as statistical sampling; in its new surroundings and owing to its nature, there was no denying its new name of the Monte Carlo method. This essay attempts to describe the details that led to this renascence and the roles played by the various actors. It is appropriate that it appears in an issue dedicated to Stan Ulam.},

As with all funds, they bring benefits and can have unwanted strings attached. In the case of military funding, the web of attached strings can be subtle and confusing.
