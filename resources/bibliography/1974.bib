  abstract = {By suspending belief that an objective world exists to be reported, we develop a conception of news as a constructed reality. Public events are held to exist because of the practical purposes they serve, rather than because of their inherent objective importance. The news content of mass media is seen as the result of practical, purposive, and creative activities on the part of news promoters, news assemblers and news consumers. At each stage in the process of generating an event, a given happening is attended to and its features assembled in the context of what has gone before and anticipated in the future. The result is a process of news creation, a kind of accounting procedure, accomplished according to the occasioned event needs of those with access to media. The manner in which access is accomplished can vary and these variations lead to a typology of event types: routines, accidents, scandals and serendipitous events. Each type of event tends to reveal different kinds of information about the ways society is organized, and each type holds different challenges to those who have or lack power. The general implications of this schema for the study of media and power are discussed.},
