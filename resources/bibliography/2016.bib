@article{aldewereld16_group_norms_multi_agent_organ_11,
 abstract     = {Normative multi-agent systems offer the ability to integrate social and individual factors to provide increased levels of fidelity with respect to modelling social phenomena, such as cooperation, coordination, group decision making, and organization, in both human and artificial agent systems. An important open research issue refers to group norms, that is, norms that govern groups of agents. Depending on the interpretation, group norms may be intended to affect the group as a whole, each member of a group, or some members of the group. Moreover, upholding group norms may require coordination among the members of the group. We have identified three sets of agents affected by group norms, namely, (i) the addressees of the norm, (ii) those that will act on it, and (iii) those that are responsible for ensuring norm compliance. We present a formalism to represent these, connecting it to a minimalist agent organisation model. We use our formalism to develop a reasoning mechanism that enables agents to identify their position with respect to a group norm to further support agent autonomy and coordination when deciding on possible courses of action.},

 abstract     = {We recall the key abstractions and models on which the major approaches to software specification rely, using Meyer's forces of computation as dimensions of comparison. Based on the identified strengths and lacks, we introduce data-awareness and of norm-awareness as recommended properties, explaining the advantages they bring about. We show that multiagent systems are a good candidate for the development of a data- and norm-aware programming, tracing directions for the realization of multiagent systems that are data and norm-aware. Finally, we report and comment some proposals from the multiagent systems literature that, though developed independently and not inserted in an organic framework, already face specific aspects that are relevant to bring about norm and data-awareness.},

 abstract     = {This paper attempts to bridge two literatures: one in political science and sociology that sees democratic values as a crucial requisite for democratic institutions, and one in economics that sees democratic institutions as the result of strategic decisions by elites or other groups. To do so, it suggests a framework for analyzing the two-way interplay between democratic values and democratic institutions. A group of citizens hold values that make them willing to rebel so as to preserve either strong executive constraints or open access to power. The share of these concerned citizens is evolving over time. Our model suggests a natural complementarity such that cultural dynamics reinforce institutional choices. We argue that the model can help to explain variation in democratic values and the history of political institutions across countries and over time, in terms of country-level heterogeneity. The model can also be used to consider the impact of foreign intervention on values and institutions.},

Pairwise comparison matrices (PCM) have been applied for ranking criteria and for scoring alternatives according to a given criterion. Our paper presents a special application of incomplete PCMs: ranking of professional tennis players based on their results against each other. The selected 25 players have been on the top of the ATP rankings for a shorter or longer period in the last 40 years. Some of them have never met on the court. One of the aims of the paper is to provide ranking of the selected players, however, the analysis of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices is also in the focus. The eigenvector method and the logarithmic least squares method were used to calculate weights from incomplete PCMs. In our results the top three players of four decades were Nadal, Federer and Sampras. Some questions have been raised on the properties of incomplete PCMs and remains open for further investigation.},

We index each operation by its input and output states, thus guaranteeing that operations satisfy preand postconditions, by typechecking. However, what if we want to write a program using several systems at once? What if we want to define a high level state transition system, such as a network application protocol, in terms of lower level states, such as network sockets and mutable variables? In this paper, I present an architecture for dependently typed applications based on a hierarchy of state transition systems, implemented as a library called states. Using states, I show: how to implement a state transition system as a dependent type, with type level guarantees on its operations; how to account for operations which could fail; how to combine state transition systems into a larger system; and, how to implement larger systems as a hierarchy of state transition systems. As an example, I implement a simple high level network application protocol.},

 abstract     = {Existing methodologies of sensitivity analysis may be insufficient for a proper analysis of Agent-based Models (ABMs). Most ABMs consist of multiple levels, contain various nonlinear interactions, and display emergent behaviour. This limits the information content that follows from the classical sensitivity analysis methodologies that link model output to model input. In this paper we evaluate the performance of three well-known methodologies for sensitivity analysis. The three methodologies are extended OAT (one-at-a-time), and proportional assigning of output variance by means of model fitting and by means of Sobol&rsquo; decomposition. The methodologies are applied to a case study of limited complexity consisting of free-roaming and procreating agents that make harvest decisions with regard to a diffusing renewable resource. We find that each methodology has its own merits and exposes useful information, yet none of them provide a complete picture of model behaviour. We recommend extended OAT as the starting point for sensitivity analysis of an ABM, for its use in uncovering the mechanisms and patterns that the ABM produces.},

@inproceedings{carbo-mascarell16_walkin_simul_,
 abstract     = {Walking has been a long standing source of literary and artistic inspiration for writers (Poe 1840; Wordsworth 1979; Sinclair 2003) political activists (Chtcheglov 1953; Garrett 2013) and artists (Breton 1960; Aragon 1999). The videogames landscape has seen a surge in walking inspired games controversially tagged as 'walking simulators'. This paper is a literary reading into three such tagged games: Year Walk, Gone Home and Dear Esther. It frames these games as continuations of the Romantic tradition of walking as an aesthetic practice thus embracing walking simulators as an art, the like of Romantic paintings and literature. Using the psychogeographic d{\'e}rive, it interprets these ludic experiences as an artistic and aesthetic expression with an emphasis on authentic emotion, subjective in play and design. Through the walk, the landscape of the games become tied to the practice of literary psychogeography following a lineage including Charles Dickets (2010), G. K. Chesterton (1905), Andre Breton (1960), Ian Sinclair (2003) and Will Self (2015). It concludes that there might be an appropriateness in using the term 'walking' in defining these games. The Romantic tradition was born out of walking and it is evolving into a digitisation of its practice.},

@article{chinco16_sound_many_funds_rebal_,
 abstract     = {This paper proposes that long rebalancing cascades (stock A's price jumps, which causes a fund to buy stock A and sell stock B, which causes a second fund to sell stock B and buy stock C, which causes...) generate noise in financial markets. First, we use a random-networks model to show that, when funds follow many different threshold-based trading strategies, a change in stock A's fundamentals can trigger a long rebalancing cascade that eventually affects the demand for unrelated stocks, like stock Z. Then, we prove that in a large market it's computationally infeasible to predict whether a long rebalancing cascade will result in buy or sell orders for stock Z. The best you can do is compute stock Z's susceptibility to these erratic non-fundamental demand shocks. By analogy, although the population of France is not a random number, whether this number is even or odd may as well be (Keynes, 1921). Finally, we use data on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to give empirical evidence for our noise-generating mechanism. We find that, in the days immediately after a stock is announced as an M&A target, unrelated stocks on the other side of the market realize larger increases in trading volume when they are more susceptible to long rebalancing cascades. And, this additional trading volume is associated with higher levels of liquidity and more informed trading, suggesting that market participants view these long rebalancing cascades as noise.},

@article{cranefield16_bayes_approac_to_norm_ident_285,
 abstract     = {When entering a system, an agent should be aware of the obligations and prohibitions (collectively norms) that will affect it. Several solutions to this norm identification prob- lem have been proposed, which make use of observations of either other's norm compliant, or norm violating, behaviour. These solutions fail in situations where norms are typically violated, or complied with, respectively. In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach to norm identification which operates by learning from both norm compliant and norm violating behaviour. By utilising both types of behaviour, our work not only overcomes a major limitation of existing approaches, but also yields improved performance over the state-of-the-art. We evaluate its effectiveness empirically, showing, under certain conditions, high accuracy scores. Categories},

 abstract     = {We show that analyst valuations became less accurate and more pessimistic following a large drop in accounting earnings that did not reveal new information about firm value. FAS 123-R required firms to begin expensing option compensation in income statements, instead of disclosing costs only in footnotes. We exploit that FAS 123-R's compliance dates were staggered quasi-randomly based on firms' fiscal year ends. Firms that expensed options were more likely to miss earnings forecast, relative to firms that did not yet expense options. Analysts also more often revised down these firms' recommendations, resulting in large market value drops. Our results are consistent with the limited attention hypothesis: Analysts and investors overvalue firms when value-relevant information is less accessible.},

 abstract     = {The university participant pool is a key resource for behavioral research, and data quality is believed to vary over the course of the academic semester. This crowdsourced project examined time of semester variation in 10 known effects, 10 individual differences, and 3 data quality indicators over the course of the academic semester in 20 participant pools (N = 2696) and with an online sample (N = 737). Weak time of semester effects were observed on data quality indicators, participant sex, and a few individual differences-conscientiousness, mood, and stress. However, there was little evidence for time of semester qualifying experimental or correlational effects. The generality of this evidence is unknown because only a subset of the tested effects demonstrated evidence for the original result in the whole sample. Mean characteristics of pool samples change slightly during the semester, but these data suggest that those changes are mostly irrelevant for detecting effects.},

@article{finan16_elect_incen_alloc_public_funds_,
 abstract     = {It is widely believed that politicians allocate public resources in ways to maximize political gains. But what is less clear is whether this comes at a cost to welfare; and if so, whether alternative electoral rules can help reduce these costs. In this paper, we address both of these questions by modeling and estimating politicians' decisions to allocate public funds. We use data from Brazil's federal legislature, which grants each federal legislator a budget to fund public projects in his state. We find that 26 percent of the public funds are distorted relative to a social planner's allocation. We then use the model to simulate several potential policies reforms to the electoral system, including adopting approval voting and implementing term limits. We find that an approval voting system reduces the distortions by 7.5 percent. Term limits also reduce distortions, but come at the cost of more corruption, which makes it a welfare-reducing policy.},

The sequences of alternatives is modelled by a non-classical (substructural) operator. In this paper we provide a modal logic based axiomatisation of the intuition they propose, and we discuss some variants (in particular for the notion of social intention, intentions that are compliant with norms). Given that the outcome operator is substructural, we first propose a novel sequence semantics (a generalisation of possible world semantics) to model the outcome operator, and we prove that the axiomatisation is sound and complete with respect to the new semantics.},

The principal manifestation of homicide of female victims explored in this article are honour killings in migrant communities in Europe, a culturally specific form of gender-related homicide. The concept of symbolic violence partially explains the honour-related violence within the framework of patriarchal theories and emphasizes the function of direct violence against women as a patriarchal backlash in a situation of structural changes in gender relations. Applying Bourdieu's theory to honour killings in Europe will explain the dynamics of violence against women in a situation where symbolic patriarchal power is undermined, due to new structural conditions, and offer guidelines on context and agent-focused approaches to tackling the phenomenon. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes the process of design, implementation, and real world deployment of a web-based network exploration tool called Network Explorer. We designed Network Explorer based on the expressed needs of our clients and later deployed it as part of a larger system for fraud detection in health care. Our implementation of Network Explorer provides visual interactive access to large-scale network data. As part of the Network Explorer tool we contribute a dynamic group-in-a-box implementation for laying out clusters, and a node navigator widget that AIDS in the exploration of large networks. We are also contributing two open source components of the Network Explorer for the community to reuse: An in-browser clustering library, and the dynamic group-in-a-box algorithm. We have evaluated the network explorer tool in multiple real-world environments including the fraud detection setting above. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Quixote uses a corpus of exemplar stories to engineer a reward function that can be used to train virtual agents to exhibit de-sired behaviors using reinforcement learning. We show the effectiveness of our system with a case study in a modified gridworld environment called Pharmacy World. In this case study, we examine the performance of Quixote under ideal conditions and evaluate how humans perceive the policies that our system produces. In addition, we examine how Quixote performs in this environment when ambi-guities in natural language correspondence causes difficulty in mapping story events to agent actions.},

It is based on a hierarchical structure, which propagates modifications to the lower lev-els with minimal effort, and a tracker-inspired user inter-face, which allows sequencing patterns on broader time-lines. It is built on top of the TidalCycles language [1, 2], and the use of functional programming paradigm allows uninterrupted audio output even the syntax does not match the required format. In addition to the pattern composi-tion, Siren supports programming variations of and tran-sitions between patterns. It features polyrhythmic timers, pattern history, local and global parameters, and mathe-matical expressiveness. Apart from its musical opportuni-ties, the interface leverages a handful of highlights such as user authentication and import/export functionality.},

Prior to the 2015 Israeli elections, we randomly assigned Palestinian and Israeli financial assets to likely voters, and incentivized them to actively trade for up to seven weeks. No political messages or non-financial information were included. The treatment systematically shifted vote choices towards parties more supportive of the peace process. This effect is not due to a direct material incentive to vote a particular way. Rather, the treatment reduces opposition to concessions for peace, and increases awareness of the broader economic risks of conflict. While participants assigned Palestinian assets are more likely to associate their assets' performance to peace, they are less engaged in the experiment. Combined with the superior performance of Israeli stocks during the study period, the ultimate effects of Israeli and Palestinian assets are similar.},

@misc{kiela16_virtual_embod_,
 abstract     = {Meaning has been called the "holy grail" of a variety of scientific disciplines, ranging from linguistics to philosophy, psychology and the neurosciences. The field of Artifical Intelligence (AI) is very much a part of that list: the development of sophisticated natural language semantics is a sine qua non for achieving a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Embodiment theories in cognitive science hold that human semantic representation depends on sensori-motor experience; the abundant evidence that human meaning representation is grounded in the perception of physical reality leads to the conclusion that meaning must depend on a fusion of multiple (perceptual) modalities. Despite this, AI research in general, and its subdisciplines such as computational linguistics and computer vision in particular, have focused primarily on tasks that involve a single modality. Here, we propose virtual embodiment as an alternative, long-term strategy for AI research that is multi-modal in nature and that allows for the kind of scalability required to develop the field coherently and incrementally, in an ethically responsible fashion.},

 abstract     = {In the current scientific publishing landscape, there is a need for an authoring workflow that easily integrates data and code into manuscripts and that enables the data and code to be published in reusable form. Automated embedding of data and code into published output will enable superior communication and data archiving. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of concept for a workflow, org-mode, which successfully provides this authoring capability and workflow integration. We illustrate this concept in a series of examples for potential uses of this workflow. First, we use data on citation counts to compute the h-index of an author, and show two code examples for calculating the h-index. The source for each example is automatically embedded in the PDF during the export of the document. We demonstrate how data can be embedded in image files, which themselves are embedded in the document. Finally, metadata about the embedded files can be automatically included in the exported PDF, and accessed by computer programs. In our customized export, we embedded metadata about the attached files in the PDF in an Info field. A computer program could parse this output to get a list of embedded files and carry out analyses on them. Authoring tools such as Emacs + org-mode can greatly facilitate the integration of data and code into technical writing. These tools can also automate the embedding of data into document formats intended for consumption.},

@incollection{kluttz16_variet_sociol_field_theor_,
 abstract     = {This Handbook provides the hidden common threads that tie sociological inquiry together and, featuring eminent scholars, it separates itself from its predecessors in substance and organization. Rather than rehashing old debates or longingly gazing at the past, this book presents sociologists with new ways of conceptualizing the organization and presentation of sociological theory. At the heart of this Handbookℓ́ℓs vision is the twin goals of making theory a viable enterprise by reconceptualizing how we teach theory and keeping theory closely tied to its empirical applications. Three strategies are offered: (1) Elucidating how classic issues like integration or interaction are interrogated today; (2) Presenting a coherent vision of the social levels of reality that theorists work on such as communities, groups, and the self as well as how the coherence of these levels speaks to the macro-micro link; and, (3) Theorizing the social world rather than celebrating theorists or theories; that is, one can look at how theory is used holistically to understand the constraints the social world places on our lived experience or the dynamics of social change. Hence, in the second decade of the 21st century, it has become clear that sociology is at a crossroads as the number of theorists and amount of theory available is increasingly unmanageable and unknowable by the vast majority of professionals and students. As such, this Handbook of Contemporary Sociological Theory presents the novice and the expert with the a roadmap for traversing this crossroad and building a more coherent, robust, and cumulative sociology.},

@thesis{knobbout16_logic_model_verif_normat_multi_agent_system_,
 abstract     = {A multi-agent system is a computerized system that is composed of multiple interacting agents within an environment. Such an agent can be a software program, but could equally well be a human actor. These systems are making their way into our everyday life, for example electronic marketplaces where agents can buy and sell goods, or smart grid energy systems where agents can produce or consume energy based on supply and demand. These systems are typically distributed and decentralized, and the participating agents may have diverging information, diverging interests, or both. The internals and architecture of these participating agents may be unknown to us, which disables us to make any strong assumption on the possible behaviour that these agents may exhibit. Moreover, these systems are generally composed or designed with a specific goal in mind. For example, an electronic marketplace is composed to facilitate safe transactions between currency and goods. Depending on the actual behaviour of the system these goals may, or may not, be achieved. Hence there is a need to regulate and control the behaviour of the system and the participating agents. In order to achieve this, norms have been proposed to regulate, coordinate, and control the behaviour of the agents and system, leading to the field of research called normative multi-agent systems. In this thesis we study enforcement norms, which are norms which can be violated, and which can lead to sanctions when a violation is detected. However, it can be the case that the norms are not well-designed, and that there exists ways for an agent to exploit the system. This may for example lead to dangerous situations within the system, or high costs for the designer. As these normative multi-agent systems can grow in size and scale, formal methods and tools are needed in order to prove whether such a system works as intended. This thesis aims to design and analyse formal logic-based frameworks in which normative multi-agent systems can be modelled and verified. Specifically, we design frameworks that aim to capture the behaviour of a normative multi-agent system, and we develop logics to reason about properties of such a system. Ultimately these logics can be used to verify the correctness of these systems. Apart from the many theoretical results, an important contribution this thesis makes is that it bridges the gap between the field of normative multi-agent systems and the modelling and verification of formal systems.},

 abstract     = {Numerous studies on the natural history of HIV-infection have revealed that the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood was the most important determining factor for the occurrence of various opportunistic infections and the most reliable prognosis indicator for the progression of HIV-infection to AIDS. It is also generally accepted that CD4+ T lymphocytes are the key cells in protective immunity in tuberculosis. Basing on these knowledges, we tried to analyze the significance of the number of CD4+ T lymphocyte in the development of clinical tuberculosis from latent infection with tubercle bacilli. Of 84 tuberculosis patients, younger than 70 years old, who had been analyzed lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry (FACS), six patients (one female, five males) had remarkably reduced number of CD4+ T lymphocytes (\textless or = 250 cells/mm3) by their first FACS analysis after diagnosis. Any obvious risk behavior and/or habit was noticed in none of the six patients, three of whom were in the twenties. FACS analyses of these six cases revealed that: 1) The proportion of total lymphocytes to total leukocytes was remarkably lower than that of tuberculosis patients as a whole as well as than that of healthy control group. 2) The numbers of total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes were all far below the normal range. (mean +/- 2 x SD of the control group). 3) The proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes to total lymphocytes was higher in five of these six cases, but the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes was lower in all six than the respective mean value of the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We describe integrated algorithms, and a tool capable of translating a high-level concept for a tactical military operation into a fully detailed, actionable plan, producing automatically (or with human guidance) plans with realistic degree of detail and of human-like quality. Tight interleaving of several algorithms -- planning, adversary estimates, scheduling, routing, attrition and consumption estimates -- comprise the computational approach of this tool. Although originally developed for Army large-unit operations, the technology is generic and also applies to a number of other domains, particularly in critical situations requiring detailed planning within a constrained period of time. In this paper, we focus particularly on the engineering tradeoffs in the design of the tool. In an experimental evaluation, reminiscent of the Turing test, the tool's performance compared favorably with human planners},

Here we show that a Bayesian inference scheme, which tracks the power of individuals, better captures behavioral and neural data compared with a reinforcement learning model inspired by rating systems used in games such as chess. We provide evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) selectively mediates the updating of knowledge about one's own hierarchy, as opposed to that of another individual, a process that underpinned successful performance and involved functional interactions with the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, we observed domain-general coding of rank in the amygdala and hippocampus, even when the task did not require it. Our findings reveal the computations underlying a core aspect of social cognition and provide new evidence that self-relevant information may indeed be afforded a unique representational status in the brain.},

@article{lebo16_manag_your_resear_pipel_49,
 abstract     = {A researcher's "pipeline" refers to the progression of papers from the idea stage to the publication stage. Tenure-track faculty and graduate students often are advised that a busy pipeline is the way to tenure. However, beyond the simple encouragement to "work harder," "write more," and "publish more," not much direction is given to junior scholars regarding how they should think about and manage their research pipeline. How does one develop a large number of papers from their first stages to the pages of respected journals? This article discusses the author's system for pipeline management. The system works (1) by separating the difficult exercise of publishing a paper into eight manageable stages; and (2) by organizing a set of papers using these steps according to a practicable timeline.},

@article{li16_multi_level_gated_recur_neural_,
 abstract     = {In this paper we focus on the problem of dialog act (DA) labelling. This problem has recently attracted a lot of attention as it is an important sub-part of an automatic dialog model, which is currently in great demand. Traditional methods tend to see this problem as a sequence labelling task and deal with it by applying classifiers with rich features. Most of the current neural network models still omit the sequential information in the conversation. Henceforth, we apply a novel multi-level gated recurrent neural network (GRNN) with non-textual information to predict the DA tag. Our model not only utilizes textual information, but also makes use of non-textual and contextual information. In comparison, our model has shown significant improvement over previous works on the Switchboard Dialog Act (SWDA) data by over 6 \%.},

POAPS includes an expressive adaptive programming language based on Lisp that has constructs for choice points that can be dynamically optimized. Non-experts can use our language to write adaptive programs that have partially observable components without needing to specify belief/hidden states or reason about probabilities. POAPS is also a compiler that defines and performs the transformation of any program written in our language into a POMDP with control knowledge. We demonstrate the generality and power of POAPS in the rapidly growing domain of human computation by describing its expressiveness and simplicity by writing several POAPS programs for common crowdsourcing tasks.},

@book{magee16_cambr_handb_wester_mystic_esoter_,
 abstract     = {Mysticism and esotericism are two intimately related strands of the Western tradition. Despite their close connections, however, scholars tend to treat them separately. Whereas the study of Western mysticism enjoys a long and established history, Western esotericism is a young field. The Cambridge Handbook of Western Mysticism and Esotericism examines both of these traditions together. The volume demonstrates that the roots of esotericism almost always lead back to mystical traditions, while the work of mystics was bound up with esoteric or occult preoccupations. It also shows why mysticism and esotericism must be examined together if either is to be understood fully. Including contributions by leading scholars, this volume features essays on such topics as alchemy, astrology, magic, Neoplatonism, Kabbalism, Renaissance Hermetism, Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, numerology, Christian theosophy, spiritualism, and much more. This handbook serves as both a capstone of contemporary scholarship and a cornerstone of future research. Table of Contents Part I. Antiquity: 1. Ancient mysteries Charles Stein 2.

@article{milan16_alter_epist_data_activ_2,
 abstract     = {As datafication progressively invades all spheres of contemporary society, citizens grow increasingly aware of the critical role of information as the new fabric of social life. This awareness triggers new forms of civic engagement and political action that we term "data activism". Data activism indicates the range of sociotechnical practices that interrogate the fundamental paradigm shift brought about by datafication. Combining Science and Technology Studies with Social Movement Studies, this theoretical article offers a foretaste of a research agenda on data activism. It foregrounds democratic agency vis-{\`a}-vis datafication, and unites under the same label ways of affirmative engagement with data ("proactive data activism", e. g. databased advocacy) and tactics of resistance to massive data collection ("reactive data activism", e. g. encryption practices), understood as a continuum along which activists position and reposition themselves and their tactics. The article argues that data activism supports the emergence of novel epistemic cultures within the realm of civil society, making sense of data as a way of knowing the world and turning it into a point of intervention and generation of data countercultures. It offers the notion of data activism as a heuristic tool for the study of new forms of political participation and civil engagement in the age of datafication, and explores data activism as an evolving theoretical construct susceptible to contestation and revision.},

 abstract     = {One of the popular albeit controversial ideas in the last century of moral philosophy is that what we ought to do is explained by our reasons. And one of the central features of reasons that accounts for their popularity among normative theorists is that they can conflict. But I argue that the fact that reasons conflict actually also poses two closely related problems for this popular idea in moral philosophy. The first problem is a generalization of a problem in deontic logic concerning the existence of conflicting obligations. The second problem arises from a tension between the fact that reasons can conflict and a model of how reasons explain `ought's that has been widely accepted. Having presented each of these problems, I develop a unified solution to them that is informed by results in both ethics and deontic logic. An important implication of this solution is that we must distinguish between derivative and nonderivative reasons and revise our conception how it is that reasons explain `ought's .},

As information technology begins to pervade every corner of human life, STSs are becoming ever more common, and the challenge of \textlessitalic\textgreatergoverning\textless/italic\textgreater STSs is becoming increasingly important. We advocate a normative basis for governance, wherein \textlessitalic\textgreaternorms\textless/italic\textgreater represent the standards of correct behaviour that each party in an STS expects from others. A major benefit of focussing on norms is that they provide a socially realistic view of interaction among autonomous parties that abstracts low-level implementation details. Overlaid on norms is the notion of a \textlessitalic\textgreatersanction\textless/italic\textgreater as a negative or positive reaction to potentially any violation of or compliance with an expectation. Although norms have been well studied as regards governance for STSs, sanctions have not. Our understanding and usage of norms is inadequate for the purposes of governance unless we incorporate a comprehensive representation of sanctions. \textless/p\textgreater},

@article{nissen16_public_bias_canon_false_facts_5,
 abstract     = {\textlessp\textgreaterScience is facing a "replication crisis" in which many experimental findings cannot be replicated and are likely to be false. Does this imply that many scientific facts are false as well? To find out, we explore the process by which a claim becomes fact. We model the community's confidence in a claim as a Markov process with successive published results shifting the degree of belief. Publication bias in favor of positive findings influences the distribution of published results. We find that unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, false claims frequently can become canonized as fact. Data-dredging, p-hacking, and similar behaviors exacerbate the problem. Should negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims would be more readily distinguished. To the degree that the model reflects the real world, there may be serious concerns about the validity of purported facts in some disciplines.\textless/p\textgreater},

@article{noriega16_coin_9628,
 abstract     = {© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. In many scenarios, humans must team with agents to achieve joint aims. When working collectively in a team of human and artificial agents, communication is important to establish a shared situation of the task at hand. With no human in the loop and little cost for communication, information about the task can be easily exchanged. However, when communication becomes expensive, or when there are humans in the loop, the strategy for sharing information must be carefully designed: too little information leads to lack of shared situation awareness, while too much overloads the human team members, decreasing performance overall. This paper investigates the effects of sharing beliefs and goals in agent teams and in human-agent teams. We performed a set of experiments using the BlocksWorlds for Teams (BW4T) testbed to assess different strategies for information sharing. In previous experimental studies using BW4T, explanations about agent behaviour were shown to have no effect on team performance. One possible reason for this is because the existing scenarios in BW4T contained joint tasks, but not joint actions. That is, atomic actions that required interdependent and simultaneous action between more than one agent. We implemented new scenarios in BW4T in which some actions required two agents to complete. Our results showed an improvement in artificial-agent team performance when communicating goals and sharing beliefs, but with goals contributing more to team performance, and that in human-agent teams, communicating only goals was more effective than communicating both goals and beliefs.},

 abstract     = {We investigate whether beliefs about the income distribution are associated with political positions for or against redistribution. Using a novel elicitation method, we assess individuals' beliefs about the shape of the income distribution in the United States.We find that beliefs about inequality, measured in terms of income dispersion, play only a marginal role in political positions as well as prospects of future wealth. Political preferences, however, are predicted by beliefs about the level of income of the poorest members of society (consistent with quasi-maximin utility functions), and a belief in an open society with equal opportunities for all.},

@article{persaud16_when_is_likel_unlik_,
 abstract     = {An important part of explaining how people communicate is to understand how people relate language to entities in the world. In describing measurements, people prefer to use qualitative words like 'tall' without precise applicability conditions, also known as vague words. The use of vague language varies widely across contexts, individuals, and tasks (single reference vs. comparisons between targets), but despite this variability, is used quite successfully. A potential strategy for using vague language is to leverage the set of alternative descriptors to settle on the best option. To determine whether people use this strategy, we conducted an experiment where participants picked vague words from sets of alternatives to describe either probability or color values. We varied the set of altenatives from which participants could choose. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that people use the set of available options to pick vague descriptors. The theoretical implications of this work are discussed.},

Since we first described our deepTools Galaxy server in 2014, we have implemented new solutions for many requests from the community and our users. Here, we introduce significant enhancements and new tools to further improve data visualization and interpretation. deepTools continue to be open to all users and freely available as a web service atdeeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de The new deepTools2 suite can be easily deployed within any Galaxy framework via the toolshed repository, and we also provide source code for command line usage under Linux and Mac OS X. A public and documented API for access to deepTools functionality is also available.},

 abstract     = {Value alignment is a property of an intelligent agent indicating that it can only pursue goals that are beneficial to humans. Successful value alignment should ensure that an artificial general intelligence cannot intentionally or unintentionally perform behaviors that adversely affect humans. This is problematic in practice since it is difficult to exhaustively enumerated by human programmers. In order for successful value alignment, we argue that values should be learned. In this paper, we hypothesize that an artificial intelligence that can read and understand stories can learn the values tacitly held by the culture from which the stories originate. We describe preliminary work on using stories to generate a value-aligned reward signal for reinforcement learning agents that prevents psychotic-appearing behavior.},

@article{riley16_devel_dynam_comput_model_social_cognit_theor_6,
 abstract     = {Social cognitive theory (SCT) is among the most influential theories of behavior change and has been used as the conceptual basis of health behavior interventions for smoking cessation, weight management, and other health behaviors. SCT and other behavior theories were developed primarily to explain differences between individuals, but explanatory theories of within-person behavioral variability are increasingly needed as new technologies allow for intensive longitudinal measures and interventions adapted from these inputs. These within-person explanatory theoretical applications can be modeled as dynamical systems. SCT constructs, such as reciprocal determinism, are inherently dynamical in nature, but SCT has not been modeled as a dynamical system. This paper describes the development of a dynamical system model of SCT using fluid analogies and control systems principles drawn from engineering. Simulations of this model were performed to assess if the model performed as predicted based on theory and empirical studies of SCT. This initial model generates precise and testable quantitative predictions for future intensive longitudinal research. Dynamic modeling approaches provide a rigorous method for advancing health behavior theory development and refinement and for guiding the development of more potent and efficient interventions.},

While several excellent studies have estimated the former prisoner population and the collateral consequences they face, far less is known about the size and scope of the total ex-felon population beyond prison walls, including those who serve their sentences on probation or in jail. This article develops state-level estimates based on demographic life tables and extends previous national estimates of the U.S. ex-felon population to 2010. We estimate that ex- prisoners comprise 2.2 percent of the U.S. voting age population and 10.4 percent of the African American male voting age population; ex-felons comprise 6.4 percent of the voting age population and 25.4 percent of the African American male voting age population. We then discuss the far-reaching consequences of the spatial concentration and enormous growth of these groups since 1980.},

@misc{song16_two_are_better_than_one_,
 abstract     = {Open-domain human-computer conversation has attracted much attention in the field of NLP. Contrary to rule- or template-based domain-specific dialog systems, open-domain conversation usually requires data-driven approaches, which can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (called a query) in a large database, and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches, typically based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can synthesize new replies, but they suffer from the problem of generating short, meaningless utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based dialog systems in the open domain. In our approach, the retrieved candidate, in addition to the original query, is fed to an RNN-based reply generator, so that the neural model is aware of more information. The generated reply is then fed back as a new candidate for post-reranking. Experimental results show that such ensemble outperforms each single part of it by a large margin.},

@inproceedings{steindorfer16_towar_,
 abstract     = {We compare official population projections with Bayesian time series forecasts for England and Wales. The Bayesian approach allows the integration of uncertainty in the data, models and model parameters in a coherent and consistent manner. Bayesian methodology for time-series forecasting is introduced, including autoregressive (AR) and stochastic volatility (SV) models. These models are then fitted to a historical time series of data from 1841 to 2007 and used to predict future population totals to 2033. These results are compared to the most recent projections produced by the Office for National Statistics. Sensitivity analyses are then performed to test the effect of changes in the prior uncertainty for a single parameter. Finally, in-sample forecasts are compared with actual population and previous official projections. The article ends with some conclusions and recommendations for future work.},

@article{stewart16_evolut_conseq_behav_diver_113,
 abstract     = {Iterated games provide a framework to describe social interactions among groups of individuals. Recent work stimulated by the discovery of "zero-determinant" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such interactions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players face a simple binary choice, to "cooperate" or "defect". Real individuals, however, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social interaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access to a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social dynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some two-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible multi-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We also show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more "rugged " fitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple levels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on investments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are high. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose non-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and zero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that a large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by strategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed populations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity.},

 abstract     = {I estimate the effect of access to Food Stamps on criminal recidivism. In 1996, a federal welfare reform imposed a lifetime ban from Food Stamps on convicted drug felons. Florida modified this ban, restricting it to drug traffickers who commit their offense on or after August 23, 1996. I exploit this sharp cutoff in a regression discontinuity design and find that the ban increases recidivism among drug traffickers. The increase is driven by financially motivated crimes, suggesting that the cut in benefits causes ex-convicts to return to crime to make up for the lost transfer income. },

 abstract     = {In game development, software teams often conduct postmortems to reflect on what went well and what went wrong in a project. The postmortems are shared publicly on gaming sites or at developer conferences. In this paper, we present an analysis of 155 postmortems published on the gaming site Gamasutra.com. We identify characteristics of game development, link the characteristics to positive and negative experiences in the postmortems and distill a set of best practices and pitfalls for game development.},

@inproceedings{wilde16_merge_tree_,
 abstract     = {With an average of more than 900 top-level merges into the Linux kernel per release, many containing hundreds of commits and some containing thousands, maintenance of older versions of the kernel becomes nearly impossible. Various commercial products, such as the Android platform, run older versions of the kernel. Due to security, performance, and changing hardware needs, maintainers must understand what changes (commits) are added to the current version of the kernel since the last time they inspected it in order to make the necessary patches. Current tools provide information about repositories through the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the repository, which is helpful for smaller projects. However, with the scale and number of branches in the kernel the DAG becomes overwhelming very quickly. Furthermore, the DAG contains every ancestor of every commit, while maintainers are more interested in how and when a commit arrives to the official Linux repository. In this paper, we propose the merge-tree, a simplified transformation of the DAG of the Linux git repository that shows the way in which commits are merged into the master branch of Linux. Using the merge-tree, we build Linvis, a tool that is designed to allow users to explore how commits are merged into the Linux kernel.},

I suggest that to fully appreciate how institutions matter, we need to complement these studies with a research program that is based on a constructivist ontology, ethnographic methods of inquiry, and use of theories of action. I exemplify this emerging research agenda, and discuss its broader analy- tical and empirical implications},
