And just like in ordinary software construction, modular implementations can help ease the process of changing a language implementation and its dependent tools. However, the syntactic and semantic dependencies between language features make this a challenging problem. In this paper we detail how programming languages can be implemented in a modular fashion using the Rascal meta-programming language. Rascal supports extensible definition of concrete syntax, abstract syntax and operations on concrete and abstract syntax trees like matching, traversal and transformation. As a result, new language features can be added without having to change existing code. As a case study, we detail our solution of the LDTA'11 Tool Challenge: a modular implementation of Oberon-0, a relatively simple imperative programming language. The approach we sketch can be applied equally well to the implementation of domain-specific languages.},

  abstract = {As thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, to protest the fatal police shooting of unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown in the summer of 2014, news and commentary on the shooting, the protests, and the militarized response that followed circulated widely through social media networks. Through a theorization of hashtag usage, we discuss how and why social media platforms have become powerful sites for documenting and challenging episodes of police brutality and the misrepresentation of racialized bodies in mainstream media. We show how engaging in " hashtag activism " can forge a shared political temporality, and, additionally, we examine how social media platforms can provide strategic outlets for contesting and reimagining the materiality of racialized bodies. Our analysis combines approaches from linguistic anthropology and social movements research to investigate the semiotics of digital protest and to interrogate both the possibilities and the pitfalls of engaging in " hashtag ethnography. " [digital anthropology, digital activism, social movements, social media, semiotics, race, Twitter, Michael Brown, United States] O n Saturday, August 9, 2014, at 12:03 p.m., an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police offi-cer in Ferguson, Missouri, a small town on the outskirts of St. Louis. Within the hour, a post appeared on the Twitter social media platform stating, " I just saw someone die, " followed by a photograph taken from behind the beams of a small wooden balcony overlooking Canfield Drive, where Michael Brown's lifeless body lay uncov-ered, hands alongside his head, face down on the asphalt. 1 Immediately following the incident, community members assembled to demand an ex-planation for why this unarmed 18-year-old had been seemingly executed while reportedly holding his hands up in a gesture of surrender, plead-ing " don't shoot. " The impromptu gathering soon turned into a sustained protest marked by daily demonstrations and violent confrontations with highly armed local police-all of which were documented in detail across social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Vine. Occurring on the heels of other highly publicized killings of unarmed black men-such as Eric Garner (who died as a result of an illegal choke-hold by New York City police just weeks before the events in Ferguson), Os-car Grant (whose death was emotionally portrayed in the award-winning film Fruitvale Station released just one year prior), and 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (whose 2012 killing sparked national outcry and spurred numer-ous forms of activism)-the death of Michael Brown quickly captured the imagination of thousands across and beyond the United States. 2},

  abstract = {As they involve relationships between interacting individuals and groups, social systems can be described at different levels of resolution. In a number of modeling cases, only one of these levels is explicitly represented. In order to study phenomena where both individual and collective representations are needed, multi-level modeling is a good approach as it explicitly represents these different levels. We propose to consider a multi-level representation from a multi-modeling point of view. This perspective allows explicitly specifying the level's relationships and, therefore, to test hypothesis about interaction between individuals and groups in social systems. We define a framework to better specify the concepts used in multi-level modeling and their relationships. This framework is implemented through the AA4MM meta-model, which benefits from a middleware layer. This meta-model uses the multi-agent paradigm to consider a multi-model as a society of interacting models. We extend this meta-model to consider multi-level modeling, and present a proof of concept of a collective motion example, where we show the advantages of this approach for the study of social phenomena. },

  abstract  = {This paper evaluates the ideological and political origins of a place-based and commercial health promotion effort, the Blue Zones Project (BZP), launched in Iowa in 2011. Through critical discourse analysis, I argue that the BZP does reflect a neoliberalization of public health, but as an "actually existing neoliberalism" it emerges from a specific policy context, including dramatic health sector policy changes due to the national Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare; a media discourse of health crisis for an aging Midwestern population; and an effort to refashion Iowa cities as sites of healthy and active living, to retain and attract a creative class of young entrepreneurs. The BZP employs many well-known mechanisms of neoliberal governance: the public-private partnership; competition among communities for "public" funds; promotion of an apolitical discourse on individual responsibility and ownership of health; decentralizing governance to the "community" level; and marketing, branding, and corporate sponsorship of public projects. The BZP exemplifies the process of "neoliberal governmentality," by which individuals learn to govern themselves and their "life projects" in line with a market-based rationality. However, with its emphasis on "nudging" individuals towards healthy behaviors through small changes in the local environment, the BZP reflects the rise of "libertarian paternalism," a variant of neoliberalism, as a dominant ideology underlying contemporary health promotion efforts.},

  abstract = {Games often have storylines. In some games, they are short backstories, serving to set up the action. The first-person shooter game Doom's storyline, about a military science experiment that accidentally opens a portal to hell, is perhaps the canonical example of this kind of story: its main purpose is to set the mood and general theme of the game, and motivate why the player is navigating levels and shooting demons. The level progression and game mechanics have very little to do with the storyline after the game starts. In other games, the storyline structures the progression of the game more pervasively, providing a narrative arc within which the gameplay takes place. The Final Fantasy games are a prominent representative of this style of game storyline. Since the theme of this book is to procedurally generate anything that goes into a game, it will not surprise the reader that we will now look at procedurally gen-erating game storylines. As with procedural generation of game rules, discussed in the previous chapter, procedural generation of storylines is somewhat different from generation of other kinds of procedural content, because storylines are an unusual kind of content. They often intertwine pervasively with gameplay, and their role in a game can depend heavily on a game's genre and mechanics. A common way of integrating a game's storyline with its gameplay, especially in adventure games and role-playing games, is the quest [24, 1]. In a quest, a player is given something to do in the game world, which is usually both motivated by the current state of the storyline, and upon completion will advance it in some way. For example, the player may be tasked with retrieving an item, helping an NPC, defeat-ing a monster, or transporting some goods to another town. Some games (especially RPGs) may be structured as one large quest, broken down into smaller sub-quests that interleave gameplay and story progression. There are several reasons a game designer might want to procedurally generate game stories, beyond the general arguments for procedural content generation dis-cussed in Chapter 1. One reason is that procedurally generated game worlds can lack meaning or motivation to the player, unless they are tied into the game story by procedurally generating relevant parts of story along with the worlds. As Ash-119 120 Yun-Gyung Cheong, Mark O. Riedl, Byung-Chull Bae, Mark J. Nelson more and Nitsche [2] argue, " without context and goals, the generated behaviors, graphics, and game spaces run the danger of becoming insubstantial and tedious " . A second reason is that proceduralizing quests can make them truly playable. Sul-livan et al. [22] note that computer RPGs often have a particularly degenerate form of quest, " generally structured as a list of tasks or milestones " , rather than open-ended goals the player can creatively satisfy. Table-top RPGs have more complex and open-ended quests, since in those games, quests can be dynamically gener-ated and adapted during gameplay by the human game-master, rather than being prewritten. Procedural quest generation gives a way to bring that flexibility back into videogame quests. 7.1 Procedural story generation via planning},

  abstract  = {We present a rule specification language called Ceptre, intended to enable rapid prototyping for experimental game mechanics, especially in domains that depend on procedural generation and multi-agent simulation. Ceptre can be viewed as an explication of a new methodology for understanding games based on linear logic, a formal logic concerned with resource usage.We present a correspondence between gameplay and proof search in linear logic, building on prior work on gen- erating narratives. In Ceptre, we introduce the ability to add interactivity selectively into a generative model, en- abling inspection of intermediate states for debugging and exploration as well as a means of play. We claim that this methodology can support game de- signers and researchers in designing, anaylzing, and de- bugging the core systems of their work in generative, multi-agent gameplay. To support this claim, we pro- vide two case studies implemented in Ceptre, one from interactive narrative and one from a strategy-like do- main. Introduction},

  abstract = {From computer games to human societies, many natural and artificial phenomena can be represented as multi-agent systems. Over time, these systems have been proven a really powerful tool for modelling and understanding phenomena in fields, such as economics and trading, health care, urban planning and social sciences. However, although, intelligent agents have been around for years, their actual implementation is still in its early stages. Since the late nineties many agent platforms have been developed. Some of them have already been abandoned whereas others continue releasing new versions. On the other hand, the agent-oriented research community is still providing more and more new platforms. This vast amount of platform options leads to a high degree of heterogeneity. Hence, a common problem is how people interested in using multi-agent systems should choose which platform to use in order to benefit from agent technology. This decision was usually left to word of mouth, past experiences or platform publicity, lately however people depend on solid survey articles. To date, in most cases multi-agent system surveys describe only the basic characteristics of a few representatives without even providing any classification of the systems themselves. This article presents a comparative up-to-date review of the most promising existing agent platforms that can be used. It is based on universal comparison and evaluation criteria, proposing classifications for helping readers to understand which agent platforms broadly exhibit similar properties and in which situations which choices should be made.},

  abstract = {Research on insurgency has been invigorated during this past decade by better data, improved methods, and the urgency of understanding active engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. This "empiricists' insurgency" reinforces a classic literature on the essential role of civilians while challenging older theories about how they affect conflict outcomes. It provides a general framework describing "irregular" insurgencies (where government capacity exceeds rebel capacity), which is analytically cohesive and empirically tested using subnational data from multiple conflicts. The new research provides guidance on intervention design, including governance improvement, development programs, and rules of engagement. The design of interventions matters: Some key evidence comes from measuring the effects of misguided policies. The framework may enable better conceived and implemented interventions, including foreign engagements with and without troop deployment, depending on the type of insurgency and mindful of political limitations. We position these findings in the literature and highlight directions for future research, including legal aspects of countering insurgency.},

  abstract  = {Clustering is often a first step when trying to make sense of a large data set. A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hi- erarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node- link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix in- teractive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the rela- tionship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clus- ters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clus- tering results},
