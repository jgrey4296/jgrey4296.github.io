 abstract     = {Extensive research has been done on planning for single-agent problems, but multi-agent planning has not as yet been thoroughly explored in agent development platforms. These platforms typically provide various mechanisms for runtime coordination, which are often useful in online planning. In this context decentralised multi-agent planning can be efficient as well as effective, especially in loosely-coupled domains, whilst also ensuring important properties in agent systems such as privacy and autonomy. In this paper, we describe the DOMAP planning framework and its integration with a multi-agent programming platform to support the achievement of social goals. Our planning framework has separate phases for goal allocation and individual HTN planning, whilst relying on available runtime coordination. Experiments on three different multi-agent systems implemented in JaCaMo show that DOMAP outperforms four other state-of-the-art multi-agent planners with regards to both planning and execution time.},

 abstract     = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) have long been envisioned as a key enabling technology in manufacturing, but this promise is yet to be realized: the lack of proper models, architectures, tooling, and the high level of expertise required for designing and programming agent-based manufacturing systems have hindered their large-scale acceptance. The emerging Web of Things (WoT), now being standardized at the W3C and IETF, provides new research opportunities that could help MAS enter the mainstream. In this paper, we present an approach to design scalable and flexible agent-based manufacturing systems that integrates automated planning with multi-agent oriented programming for the WoT: autonomous agents synthesize production plans using semantic descriptions of Web-based artifacts and coordinate with one another via multi-agent organizations; engineers can program and repurpose the systems on the fly via an intuitive Web user interface. The systems use the Web as an application architecture (and not just as a transport layer), which facilitates the seamless integration of geographically distributed production cells. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented a prototypical production cell that uses industry-grade robots and an augmented reality interface for human workers. Together, these contributions demonstrate a means to achieve an intriguing vision for the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution: a global collective intelligence for manufacturing.},

 abstract     = {The World Wide Web has evolved drastically over the past decade -- and the proliferation of Web APIs has turned it into the middleware of choice for most distributed systems. The recent focus on hypermedia-driven APIs together with initiatives such as the Web of Things and Linked Data are now promoting and advancing the development of a new generation of dynamic, open, and long-lived systems on the Web. These systems require agent-based solutions to the point that Web researchers have started to build autonomous systems on their own. It is thus both timely and necessary to investigate and align the latest developments in Web research and multi-agent systems (MAS) research. We argue that the answer lies equally in a lack of practical use cases as well as the premature development and alignment of Web and agent technologies. We then present our vision for a new generation of autonomous systems on the Web, which we call hypermedia MAS, together with the research opportunities and challenges they bring.},

Reasoning with GPTs connects the AAMAS community with other communities such as automated planning, and forms the foundation for important reasoning capabilities, especially intention progression in Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. Research on GPTs has a long history but suffers from fragmentation and lack of common terminology, data formats, and enabling tools. One way to address this fragmentation is through a competition. Competitions are increasingly being used as a means to foster research and challenge the state of the art. For example, the AAMAS conference has a number of associated competitions, such as the Trading Agent Competition, while agent research is showcased at competitions such as RoboCup. We therefore issue a call for a Goal-Plan Tree Contest, with the ambition of drawing together a community and incentivizing research in intention progression.},

In this work, we extend an argumentation-based reasoning mechanism to take into account preferences over arguments supporting contrary conclusions. Such preferences come from elements that are present or can be more easily obtained in the context of practical multi-agent programming platforms, such as multiple sources from which the information (used to construct the arguments) was acquired, as well as varying degrees of trust on them. Further, we introduce different agent profiles by varying the way certain operators are applied over the various information sources. Unlike previous approaches, our approach accounts for multiple sources for a single piece of information and is based on an argumentation-based reasoning mechanism implemented on a multi-agent platform.},

 abstract     = {One of the most important aspects of multi-agent systems is communication. Among the communication techniques in multi-agent systems, argumentation-based approaches have received special interest from the community, because they provide a rich form of communication by means of agents exchanging arguments. However, the additional information exchanged by agents could have an extra weight on the communication infrastructure, restricting the usage of argumentation techniques. In this work, we introduce an argumentation framework whereby agents are able to exchange fewer and shorter messages when engaging in dialogues by omitting information that is common knowledge (e.g., information about a shared multi-agent organisation). In particular, we use the idea of enthymemes, as well as referring to shared argumentation schemes (i.e., reasoning patterns from which such arguments were instantiated) and common organisational knowledge to guide argument reconstruction. We argue that the approach makes argumentation-based communication more efficient in the sense that agents can exchange fewer messages with shorter content, yet without any loss in the intended arguments.},

 abstract     = {"Agents and Artifacts" (A&amp;A) and CARTAGO are becoming increasingly popular as, respectively, a general-purpose programming model and a related infrastructure for developing shared computational environments in agent-based software systems. However, so far there has been no work on developing multiagent systems (MAS) where agents implemented and deployed in different agent-programming platforms can interact as part of the same MAS with a shared environment. Due to the generality of CARTAGO environments and its Java-based implementation, we have successfully implemented an open multi-agent system where heterogeneous agents developed with different platforms---namely Jason, 2APL as BDI-based approaches and simpA as an activity-oriented approach rather than BDI-based---work together in shared workspaces where they interact and cooperate by dynamically creating and using shared artifacts, analogously to human working environments. This paper shows how this was achieved by first presenting a general model for incorporating a theory of use and observation of artifacts in cognitive agents, then describing a general approach for developing such heterogeneous MAS using CARTAGO integrated with existing agent-oriented programming platforms.},
