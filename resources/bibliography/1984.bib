  abstract = {Since production systems (PS's) were first proposed by Post (1943) general computational mechanism, the methodology has seen a great deal of development and has been applied to a diverse collection of problems. Despite the wide scope of goals and perspectives demonstrated by the various systems, there appear to be many recurrent themes. We present an analysis and overview of those themes, as well as a conceptual frame-work by which many of the seemingly disparate efforts can be viewed, both in relation to each other and to other methodologies. Accordingly, we use the term production system in a broad sense and show how most systems that have used the term can be fit into the framework. The comparison to other methodologies is intended to provide a view of PS characteristics in a broader context, with primary reference to procedurally based techniques, but also with reference to more recent developments in programming and the organization of data and knowledge bases. This chapter begins by offering a review of the essential structure and function of a PS, presenting a picture of a "pure" PS to provide a basis for subsequent elaborations. Current views of PS's fall into two distinct classes, and we shall demonstrate that this dichotomy may explain much of the existing variation in goals and methods. This is followed by some specu-lations on the nature of appropriate and inappropriate problem domains for PS's i.e., what is it about a problem that makes the PS methodology appropriate, and how do these factors arise out of the system's basic struc-ture and function? Next, we review characteristics common to all systems, explaining how they contribute to the basic character and noting their This chapter is based on an article taken with permission from Machine Intelligence 8: Machine Representations of Knowledge, edited by E. W. Elcock and D. Michie, published in 1977 by ELlis},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a formal mode of representation and a corresponding way of thinking about institutionalized social action. It draws its representational technique and its way of thinking about its subject from several sources, including systems theory, cognitive science, and structuralism. It is based on the idea that a model involves a proposed generative mechanism for observable patterns of action and that such a generator must be a system of rules. We discuss the philosophical and sociological presuppositions of our proposal, then outline in detail and illustrate the idea of a production system model. Following this, we argue that the proposed mode of representation is appropriate for "the action frame of reference" and then develop a series of specific "problematics" involving the structural analysis of institutionalized social action. We conclude with a discussion of issues and problems for further research. The paper does not include mathematical work found elsewhere, although it tries to indicate its significance. Similarly, it does not include data analyses reported elsewhere, although it tries to show that the models make definite predictions about certain forms of data. In short, the paper strives to be a readable introduction to the conceptual foundations of a line of investigation.},

  abstract = {There is a population explosion among the logical systems being used in computer science. Examples include first order logic (with and without equality), equational logic, Horn clause logic, second order logic, higher order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic, process logic, temporal logic, and modal logic; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic logical system. Yet it is usual to give many of the same results and applications for each logical system; of course, this is natural in so far as there are basic results in computer science that are independent of the logical system in which they happen to be expressed. But we should not have to do the same things over and over again; instead, we should generalize, and do the essential things once and for all! Also, we should ask what are the relationships among all these different logical systems. This paper shows how some parts of computer science can be done in any suitable logical system, by introducing the notion of an institution as a precise generalization of the informal notion of a "logical system." A first main result shows that if an institution is such that interface declarations expressed in it can be glued together, then theories (which are just sets of sentences) in that institution can also be glued together. A second main result gives conditions under which a theorem prover for one institution can be validly used on theories from another; this uses the notion of an institution morphism. A third main result shows that institutions admiting free models can be extended to institutions whose theories may include, in addition to the original sentences, various kinds of constraints upon interpretations; such constraints are useful for defining abstract data types, and include so-called "data," "hierarchy," and "generating" constraints. Further results show how to define insitutions that mix sentences from one institution with constraints from another, and even mix sentences and (various kinds of) constraints from several different institutions. It is noted that general results about institutions apply to such "multiplex" institutions, including the result mentioned above about gluing together theories. Finally, this paper discusses some applications of these results to specification languages, showing that much of that subject is in fact independent of the institution used.},

  abstract      = {Henri Lefebvre has considerable claims to be the greatest living philosopher. His work spans some sixty years and includes original work on a diverse range of subjects, from dialectical materialism to architecture, urbanism and the experience of everyday life. The Production of Space is his major philosophical work and its translation has been long awaited by scholars in many different fields. The book is a search for a reconciliation between mental space (the space of the philosophers) and real space (the physical and social spheres in which we all live). In the course of his exploration, Henri Lefebvre moves from metaphysical and ideological considerations of the meaning of space to its experience in the everyday life of home and city. He seeks, in other words, to bridge the gap between the realms of theory and practice, between the mental and the social, and between philosophy and reality. In doing so, he ranges through art, literature, architecture and economics, and further provides a powerful antidote to the sterile and obfuscatory methods and theories characteristic of much recent continental philosophy. This is a work of great vision and incisiveness. It is also characterized by its author's wit and by anecdote, as well as by a deftness of style which Donald Nicholson-Smith's sensitive translation precisely captures.},
