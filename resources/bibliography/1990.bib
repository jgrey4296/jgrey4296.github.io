@article{marradi90_class_typol_taxon_24,
 abstract     = {The semantic field associated with the term 'classification', three main intellectual and/or practical operations, and three different products, can be identified - there being no one-to-one correspondence between operations and products. Through intensional classification, the extension of a concept at a given level of generality is subdivided into two or more narrower extensions corresponding to as many concepts at lower level of generality; this subdivision is obtained by stating that an aspect of the intension of each of the latter concepts is a different partial articulation of the corresponding aspect of the intension of the higher concept. Through extensional classification, the objects or events of a given set are grouped into two or more subsets according to the perceived similarities of their states on one or (more frequently) several properties; subsets may be successively grouped into subsets of wider extension and higher hierarchical level. Through classing, objects or events are assigned to classes or types which have been previously defined, usually by an intensional classification, but possibly by an extensional one operating on a different set. When only one fundamentum divisionis is considered, a classification scheme is produced - usually by an intensional classification. The extensions of each class must be mutually exclusive, and jointly exhaustive. Classes need not be at the same level of generality, and may be ordered. When several fundamenta are jointly considered, a typology is produced. This may be done through either intensional or extensional classification. The underlying category space may be " reduced " or reconstructed through " substruction " . When several fundamenta are considered in succession through a series of intensional classifications, a taxonomy is produced. Specific concepts/terms (such as taxon, rank, clade) are needed to deal with taxonomies. In the final chapter it is argued that the role of classification has been improperly assessed by several different quarters: in particular by those who credit it with ontological capacities and tasks; by those who see classificatory procedures as an old-fashioned activity to be abandoned in favour of more " scientific " measurement; and by those who blame the retarded development of an " explanatory " social science on the undue attention paid to classification by many of the founding fathers of sociology and cognate disciplines.},

Dennis Merritt chooses a step-by-step approach to building systems, explaining the concepts and showing the Prolog code at each stage. The book builds on simple beginning systems and progresses up to relatively sophisticated expert system tools. It does not emphasize techniques of logic programming or the particularities of Prolog, but rather, emphasizes Prolog as an efficient software development tool, and teaches how to build expert systems and design the necessary tools. It is recommended (but not required) that the reader use a Prolog interpreter along with reading this book to experiment with the various Prolog examples given throughout the text.},

Although widely known as the principal language of artificial intelligence research-one of the most advanced areas of computer science-Lisp is an excellent language for beginners. It is increasingly the language of choice in introductory programming courses due to its friendly, interactive environment, rich data structures, and powerful software tools that even a novice can master in short order.},
