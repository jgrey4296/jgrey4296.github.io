 abstract     = {This paper examines problems offitzziness, i.e., vagueness, ambiguity, and ambivalence. Although the theory is called a 'logic of inexact concepts', we do not endorse belief in some Platonic ideal 'concepts' or logic embodying their essence. Rather we suggest a method for con- structing and studying models of the way we use words; and we use the word 'concept' metaphorically in discussing meaning. 'Exact concepts' are the sort envisaged in pure mathematics, while 'inexact concepts' are rampant in everyday life. This distinction is complicated by the fact that whenever a human being interacts with mathematics, it becomes part of his ordinary experience, and therefore subject to inexactness. Ordinary logic is much used in mathematics, but applications to everyday life have been criticized because our normal language habits seem so different. Various modifications of orthodox logic have been suggested as remedies, particularly omission of the Law of the Excluded Middle.},
