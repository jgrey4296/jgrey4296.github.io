Some objections to and limitations of the approach are discussed. The paper concludes with a case study giving a detailed example of the use of the isomorphic approach in a particular application.},

@misc{bourdieu92_pract_reflex_sociol,
 abstract     = {Over the last three decades, the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has produced one of the most imaginative and subtle bodies of social theory and research of the post war era. Yet, despite the influence of his work, no single introduction to his wide-ranging oeuvre is available. This book, intended for an English-speaking audience, offers a systematic and accessible overview, providing interpretive keys to the internal logic of Bourdieu's work by explicating thematic and methodological principles underlying his work. The structure of Bourdieu's theory of knowledge, practice, and society is first dissected by Loic Wacquant; he then collaborates with Bourdieu in a dialogue in which they discuss central concepts of Bourdieu's work, confront the main objections and criticisms his work has met, and outline Bourdieu's views of the relation of sociology to philosophy, economics, history, and politics. The final section captures Bourdieu in action in the seminar room as he addresses the topic of how to practice the craft of reflexive sociology. Throughout, they stress Bourdieu's emphasis on reflexivity-his inclusion of a theory of intellectual practice as an integral component of a theory of society-and on method-particularly his manner of posing problems that permits a transfer of knowledge from one area of inquiry into another.},

An example of a simulation of an ant colony follows as an illustration of the multiple domains in which multi-agent simulation may be used.},

@article{goguen92_instit,
 abstract     = {There is a population explosion among the logical systems used m computing science. Examples include first-order logic, equational logic, Horn-clause logic, higher-order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic. intuitionistic logic, order-sorted logic, and temporal loglc; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic loglcal system. The concept of institution is introduced to formalize the informal notion of logical system. The major requirement is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences that is consistent under change of notation. Institutions enable abstracting away from syntactic and semantic detail when working on language structure in-the-large; for example, we can define language features for building large structures from smaller ones, possibly involving parameters, without commitment to any particular logical system, This applies to both specification languages and programming languages. Institutions also have applications to such areas as database theory and the semantics of artnlcial and natural languages. A first main result of this paper says that any institution such that signatures (which define notation) can be glued together, also allows gluing together theories (which are just collections of sentences over a fixed signature). A second main result considers when theory structuring is preserved by institution morphisms. A third mam result gwes conditions under which lt M sound to use a theorem prover for one institution on theories from another. A fourth main result shows bow to extend institutions so that their theories may include, in addltlon to the original sentences, various kinds of constraint that are useful for defining abstract data types, including both data and hierarchy constraints. Further results show how to define institutions that allow sentences and constraints from two or more institutions. All our general results apply to such constraints and multiplex institutions.},

@article{jackson92_polit_street,
 abstract     = {Focusing on Caribana, an annual Caribbean festival in Toronto, this paper explores the political significance of street festivals and related events. Based on field observation, interviews and archival research in Toronto, the paper makes some comparisons between Caribana and similar events in Britain and other parts of the Afro-Caribbean diaspora. It situates an analysis of Caribana within the context of Canada's official commitment to multiculturalism arguing that this policy defines the terms and sets the limits of the political potential of Caribana which its participants constantly threaten to transgress. Various territorial issues are central to the political and social geography of Caribana, including the routing (and re-routing) of the parade and the strategies of 'containment' used to police the parade and associated festivities. The paper argues that through its limited financial commitment to Caribana the state restricts the legitimate expression of cultural difference, exposing the contradictions of official multiculturalist rhetoric. The paper begins and ends with some broader reflections on the political significance of street festivals in the context of an increasingly post-colonial, postmodern world. © 1992.},
