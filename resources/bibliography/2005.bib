@article{ala-mutka05_survey_autom_asses_approac_progr_assig_15,
 abstract     = {Practical programming is one of the basic skills pursued in computer science education. On programming courses, the coursework consists of programming assignments that need to be assessed from different points of view. Since the submitted assignments are executable programs with a formal structure, some features can be assessed automatically. The basic requirement for automated assessment is the numerical measurability of assessment targets, but semiautomatic approaches can overcome this restriction. Recognizing automatically assessable features can help teachers to create educational models, where automatic tools let teachers concentrate their work on the learning issues that need student-teacher interaction the most. Several automatic tools for both static and dynamic assessment of computer programs have been reported in the literature. This article promotes these issues by surveying several automatic approaches for assessing programming assignments. Not all the existing tools will be covered, simply because of the vast number of them. The article concentrates on bringing forward different assessment techniques and approaches to give an interested reader starting points for finding further information in the area. Automatic assessment tools can be used to help teachers in grading tasks as well as to support students' working process with automatic feedback. Common advantages of automation are the speed, availability, consistency and objectivity of assessment. However, automatic tools emphasize the need for careful pedagogical design of the assignment and assessment settings. To effectively share the knowledge and good assessment solutions already developed, better interoperability and portability of the tools is needed.},

@inproceedings{arbab05_abstr_55,
 abstract     = {The notion of Abstract Data Type (ADT) has served as a foundation model for structured and object oriented programming for some thirty years. The current trend in software engineering toward component based systems requires a foundation model as well. The most basic inherent property of an ADT, i.e., that it provides a set of operations, subverts some highly desirable properties in emerging formal models for components that are based on the object oriented paradigm. We introduce the notion of Abstract Behavior Type (ABT) as a higher-level alternative to ADT and propose it as a proper foundation model for both components and their composition. An ABT defines an abstract behavior as a relation among a set of timed-data-streams, without specifying any detail about the operations that may be used to implement such behavior or the data types it may manipulate for its realization. The ABT model supports a much looser coupling than is possible with the ADT's operational interface, and is inherently amenable to exogenous coordination. We propose that both of these are highly desirable, if not essential, properties for models of components and their composition. To demonstrate the utility of the ABT model, we describe Reo: an exogenous coordination language for compositional construction of component connectors based on a calculus of channels. We show the expressive power of Reo, and the applicability of ABT, through a number of examples. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

There has been an emerging consensus on theAI approach, in particular the use of planning systems. However, thesehave concentrated on the generation of a sequence of narrative actions,staged through the behaviour of virtual actors. In order to achieve thelong-term objective of implementing interactive media that wouldreproduce the aesthetic qualities of traditional films, mostinteractive storytelling systems are still missing the ability togenerate dialogues between characters. We describe an extension of ourInteractive Storytelling approach which integrates dialogue generationwithin narrative situations. Our unit of generation is the dialogue act(pair of utterances) and one main objective is to reproduce realisticdialogue phenomena based on implicit forms of expression. The emphasisis also on adopting a unified approach relating narrativerepresentations to the linguistic form of the generated utterances.From a representation of active narrative goals and the emotionalaffinity between characters, our system is able to derive a set ofparameters governing various aspects of the linguistic form to begenerated. We illustrate this approach on several implemented examples.},

Analysis of live coding as a context for programming allows us to escape the implicit assumptions of the commercial office environment in which so much end-user programming has been studied. The programming environments of the future, with increasing deployment of ubiquitous computing technologies, will be unlike offices in many ways. We can prepare for this future by studying extreme varieties of programming today. Live coding is thus an ideal research opportunity for psychology of programming},

@inproceedings{costanza05_languag_,
 abstract     = {ContextL is an extension to the Common Lisp Object System that allows for Context-oriented Programming. It provides means to associate partial class and method definitions with layers and to activate and deactivate such layers in the control flow of a running program. When a layer is activated, the partial definitions become part of the program until this layer is deactivated. This has the effect that the behavior of a program can be modified according to the context of its use without the need to mention such context dependencies in the affected base program. We illustrate these ideas by providing different UI views on the same object while, at the same time, keeping the conceptual simplicity of object-oriented programming that objects know by themselves how to behave, in our case how to display themselves. These seemingly contradictory goals can be achieved by separating class definitions into distinct layers instead of factoring out the display code into different classes.},

 abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a framework for modelling agent organizations, Omni, that allows the balance of global organizational requirements with the autonomy of individual agents. It specifies global goals of the system independently from those of the specific agents that populate the system. Both the norms that regulate interaction between agents, as well as the contextual meaning of those interactions are important aspects when specifying the organizational structure. Omni integrates all this aspects in one framework. In order to make design of the multi-agent system manageable, we distinguish three levels of abstraction with increasing implementation detail. All dimensions of Omni have a formal logical semantics, which ensures consistency and possibility of verification of the different aspects of the system. Omni is therefore utmost suitable for the modelling of all types of 1.},

@article{farrell05_using_event_calcul_track_normat_state_contr_14,
 abstract     = {In this work, we have been principally concerned with the representation of contracts so that their normative state may be tracked in an automated fashion over their deployment lifetime. The normative state of a contract, at a particular time, is the aggregation of instances of normative relations that hold between contract parties at that time, plus the current values of contract variables. The effects of contract events on the normative state of a contract are specified using an XML formalisation of the Event Calculus, called ecXML. We use an example mail service agreement from the domain of web services to ground the discussion of our work. We give a characterisation of the agreement according to the normative concepts of: obligation, power and permission, and show how the ecXML representation may be used to track the state of the agreement, according to a narrative of contract events. We also give a description of a state tracking architecture, and a contract deployment tool, both of which have been implemented in the course of our work.},

@inproceedings{garcia-camino05_implem_,
 abstract     = {Ideally, open multi-agent systems (MAS) involve heterogeneous and autonomous agents whose interactions ought to conform to some shared conventions. The challenge is how to express and enforce such conditions so that truly autonomous agents can adscribe to them. One way of addressing this issue is to look at MAS as environments regulated by some sort of normative framework. There have been significant contributions to the formal aspects of such normative frameworks, but there are few proposals that have made them operational. In this paper a possible step towards closing that gap is suggested. A normative language is introduced which is expressive enough to represent the familiar types of MAS-inspired normative frameworks; its implementation in JESS is also shown. This proposal is aimed at adding flexibility and generality to electronic institutions by extending their deontic components through richer types of norms that can still be enforced on-line.},

Two new justices have joined the high court, more than 800 cases have been decided, and a good deal of new scholarship has appeared on many of the topics treated in the Companion. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presided over the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, and the Court as a whole played a decisive and controversial role in the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. Under Rehnquists's leadership, a bare majority of the justices have rewritten significant areas of the law dealing with federalism, sovereign immunity, and the commerce power.This new edition includes new entries on key cases and fully updated treatment of crucial areas of constitutional law, such as abortion, freedom of religion, school desegregation, freedom of speech, voting rights, military tribunals, and the rights of the accused. These developments make the second edition of this accessible and authoritative guide essential for judges, lawyers, academics, journalists, and anyone interested in the impact of the Court's decisions on American society.},

@article{henson05_what_can_funct_neuroim_tell_exper_psych_58,
 abstract     = {I argue here that functional neuroimaging data--which I restrict to the haemodynamic techniques of fMRI and PET--can inform psychological theorizing, provided one assumes a "systematic" function-structure mapping in the brain. In this case, imaging data simply comprise another dependent variable, along with behavioural data, that can be used to test competing theories. In particular, I distinguish two types of inference: function-to-structure deduction and structure-to-function induction. With the former inference, a qualitatively different pattern of activity over the brain under two experimental conditions implies at least one different function associated with changes in the independent variable. With the second type of inference, activity of the same brain region(s) under two conditions implies a common function, possibly not predicted a priori. I illustrate these inferences with imaging studies of recognition memory, short-term memory, and repetition priming. I then consider in greater detail what is meant by a "systematic" function-structure mapping and argue that, particularly for structure-to-function induction, this entails a one-to-one mapping between functional and structural units, although the structural unit may be a network of interacting regions and care must be taken over the appropriate level of functional/structural abstraction. Nonetheless, the assumption of a systematic function-structure mapping is a "working hypothesis" that, in common with other scientific fields, cannot be proved on independent grounds and is probably best evaluated by the success of the enterprise as a whole. I also consider statistical issues such as the definition of a qualitative difference and methodological issues such as the relationship between imaging and behavioural data. I finish by reviewing various objections to neuroimaging, including neophrenology, functionalism, and equipotentiality, and by observing some criticisms of current practice in the imaging literature.},

@inproceedings{johnson05_serious_games_languag_learn_125,
 abstract     = {Modern computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users, but also in promoting learning. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games, games that have non-entertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter, the techniques employed are very different. Can AIED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques, or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS), a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling, pedagogical agents, and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world, interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties, and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.},

He notes a number of such scripts emerging and flourishing between 1970 and 1990, speculating that sadomasochistic stories might be in the ascendant at the turn of century. However, Langdridge and Butt (2004) find little evidence of the emergence of a coherent sadomasochistic identity. They contend that the transgressive nature of the sexual in sadomasochism makes it difficult for participants in such practices to achieve legitimate "sexual citizenship" (Weeks, 1998). In this article, we note the emergence of an alternative construction of sadomasochistic practices; one that emphasises the erotic exchange of power. This illustrates both personal and social moments in the construction of erotic life. In},

Furthermore, it is a fully orthogonal extension to existing type systems and programming languages.

It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

@inproceedings{meredith05_names_3705_LNCS,
 abstract     = {The $$$$\pi$$$$-calculus is not a closed theory, but rather a theory dependent upon some theory of names. Taking an operational view, one may think of the $$$$\pi$$$$-calculus as a procedure that when handed a theory of names provides a theory of processes that communicate over those names. This openness of the theory has been exploited in $$$$\pi$$$$-calculus implementations, where ancillary mechanisms provide a means of interpreting of names, e.g. as tcp/ip ports. But, foundationally, one might ask if there is a closed theory of processes, i.e. one in which the theory of names arises from and is wholly determined by the theory of processes. Here we present such a theory in the form of an asynchronous message-passing calculus built on a notion of quoting. Names are quoted processes, and as such represent the code of a process, a reification of the syntactic structure of the process as an object for process manipulation. Name- passing in this setting becomes a way of passing the code of a process as a message. In the presence of a dequote operation, turning the code of a process into a running instance, this machinery yields higher-order characteristics without the introduction of process variables. As is standard with higher-order calculi, replication and/or recursion is no longer required as a primitive operation. Somewhat more interestingly, the introduction of a process constructor to dynamically convert a process into its code is essential to obtain computational completeness, and simultaneously supplants the function of the $Î½$ operator. In fact, one may give a compositional encoding of the $Î½$ operator into a calculus featuring dynamic quote as well as dequote. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversity explains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.},

@inproceedings{paglieri05_revis_belief_throug_argum_,
 abstract     = {This paper compares within the MAS framework two separate threads in the formal study of epistemic change: belief revision and argumentation theories. Belief revision describes how an agent is supposed to change his own mind, while argumentation deals with persuasive strategies employed to change the mind of other agents. These are two sides (cognitive and social) of the same epistemic coin: argumentation theories are incomplete, if they cannot be grounded in belief revision models - and vice versa. Nonetheless, so far the formal treatment of belief revision mostly neglected any systematic comparison with argumentation theories. In MAS such problem becomes evident and inescapable: belief change is usually triggered by communication and persuasion from other agents, involving deception, trust, reputation, negotiation, conflict resolution (all typical issues faced by argumentation-based models). Therefore, a closer comparison between belief revision and argumentation is a necessary preliminary step towards an integrated model of epistemic change in MAS.},

Autopoiesis provides a systemic language for speaking about intrinsic teleology but its original formulation needs to be elaborated further in order to explain sense-making. This is done by introducing adaptivity, a many-layered property that allows organisms to regulate themselves with respect to their conditions of viability. Adaptivity leads to more articulated concepts of behaviour, agency, sense- construction, health, and temporality than those given so far by autopoiesis and enaction. These and other implications for understanding the organismic generation of values are explored.},

 abstract     = {This paper analyses the phenomenon of a shift of the burden of proof in legal persuasion dialogues. Some sample dialogues are analysed of types of situations where such a shift may occur, viz. reasoning with defeasible rules, reasoning with argumentation schemes and reasoning with mere presumptions. It is argued that whether a shift in the burden of proof occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion dialogues about the burden of proof. It is also shown that dialogues about the burden of proof are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

@article{pringle05_spatial_pleas_8,
 abstract     = {This article suggests that a changing sensibility to spatial experience is a characteristic of moder- nity. It makes three assumptions: that modernity finds spatial manipulation thrilling, that spatial experience has a history that relates to the history of perception, and that the study of a society's entertainments can offer insights into its underlying shifts and disturbances. It draws on a range of theories on the role of the corporeal in perception to speculate as to how an audience might have experienced three popular entertainments from the early 20th century. All three shifted the bound- aries of the body, not only in the apparent bodies of the performers but also, the author suggests, in ways that resonated within the bodies of their audiences. The author suggests that such internal resonances, engaging the senses imaginatively and viscerally, contribute to the perceptual vocabu- lary of modernity and often form part of the practice and experience of today's spatial arts.},

 abstract     = {Small-world and power-law network structures have been prominently proposed as models of large networks. However, the assumptions of these models usually lack sociological grounding. We present a computational model grounded in social exchange theory. Agents search attractive exchange partners in a diverse population. Agent use simple decision heuristics, based on imperfect, local information. Computer simulations show that the topological structure of the emergent social network depends heavily upon two sets of conditions, harshness of the exchange game and learning capacities of the agents. Further analysis show that a combination of these conditions affects whether star-like, small-world or power-law structures emerge.},

 abstract     = {Software evolution is expensive. Lehman identifies several problems associated with it: Continuous adaptation, increasing complexity, continuing growth, and declining quality. This paper proposes that a reflective software engineering environment will address these problems by employing languages and techniques from the software architecture community. Creating a software system will involve manipulating a collection of views, including low-level code views and high-level architectural views which will be tied together using reflection. This coupling will allow the development environment to automatically identify inconsistencies between the views, and support software engineers in managing architectures during evolution. This paper proposes a research programme which will result in a software engineering environment which addresses problems of software evolution and the maintenance of consistency between architectural views of a software system.},

In response to a perceived lack of depth and realism in the team relationship dynamics of modern gaming, the project developed a human agent architecture, multiagent system, and demonstrative game application. The agent architecture was based partially on research into social psychology, and utilized emotion and belief representations to drive action selection. Agent interaction and relationship development was produced on the basis of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), through which a team's success came to be determined by its members' choices to cooperate or compete with its leader.},

 abstract     = {The ability to generate narrative is of importance to computer systems that wish to use story effectively for entertainment, training, or education. One of the focuses of intelligent virtual agent research in general and story generation research in particular is how to make agents/characters more lifelike and compelling. However, one question that invariably comes up is: Is the generated story good? An easier question to tackle is whether a reader/viewer of a generated story perceives certain essential attributes such as causal coherence and character believability. Character believability is the perception that story world characters are acting according to their own beliefs, desires, and intentions. We present a novel procedure for objectively evaluating stories generated for multiple agents/characters with regard to character intentionality - an important aspect of character believability. The process transforms generated stories into a standardized model of story comprehension and then indirectly compares that representation to reader/viewer mental perceptions about the story. The procedure is illustrated by evaluating a narrative planning system, Fabulist.},

 abstract     = {In the past emotions have been dismissed as a distraction to the logical, scientific thought process. More recently however, the importance of emotion in human-like intelligence and behaviour has been identified. This project aims at exploring this aspect of Artificial Intelligence by modeling the ability to display emotions in autonomous software agents within the constraints of a virtual environment. The motivation behind this is to determine whether the behaviour of these agents will cause the human participant to interact with the agent as if interacting with other humans. We have created an Agent-Cocktail Party World for this purpose and an Avatar-Cocktail Party World for the purpose of studying the psychological phenomenon of Ostracism. Our results show that the addition of an emotion-based intelligent component was able to make a statistically significant difference to the experimental condition by creating a more realistic environment in which to simulate the Punitive Ostracism condition.

Computer games have been considered textquotedbllefta series of interesting choicestextquotedblright . Is it possible to think of games as moral objects? Or, more precisely: is the design of computer games morally accountable? Computer game design is the craft of gameplay, the challenge of creating a balanced and enjoyable game. In a way, computer game design is the art of creating interesting, entertaining choices. What are the ethics this activity imprints in computer games? What are the ethics of game design? This paper will argue for the analysis of computer games as moral objects because of the ethical values that can be imprinted in their design. Understanding the importance of design as a creative ethical activity, will allow the analysis of computer gamestextquoteright rethorics and the ways they are or could be used for conveying engaging ethical experiences. Understanding the morality of the digital expression can show us both the ways for new expressions, and the moral being of computer game as a form of art.},

@book{thornton05_instit_logic_,
 abstract     = {The phrase, 'institutional logic' has become somewhat of a buzz-word. Buzz words are over used; as a result their meanings often get distorted and overextended and they burn-out of existence. Mizruchi and Fein (1999) showed in the institutional theory literature how meanings get distorted and then taken for granted. To avoid misunderstandings of the institutional logic concept and to build on research in this genre, now is the time to reflect on definitions and the theoretical and methodological contributions this perspec- tive brings to the analysis of institutions. We begin by defining the concept of an institutional logic and how it emerged as part of the development of institutional theory since the 1970s. Second, we illustrate the institutional logics approach as both a meta- theory and a method of analysis. Third, we present a select review of the literature emphasizing how the institutional logics approach makes headway in addressing sev- eral limitations and tensions identified by scholars of institutional analysis. In this review we focus on an analysis of the implicit and explicit social mechanisms employed in these studies, not on the description or strength of their empirical findings. Last, we critique the literature on institutional logics and suggest how the approach can be used to further advance the study of organizations and institutions.},
