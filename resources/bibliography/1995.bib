While traditional theorizing has tended to the focus on extreme expressions of nationalism, the author turns his attention to the everyday, less visible forms which are neither exotic or remote, he describes as `banal nationalism'. The author asks why people do not forget their national identity. He suggests that in daily life nationalism is constantly flagged in the media through routine symbols and habits of language. Banal Nationalism is critical of orthodox theories in sociology, politics and social psychology for ignoring this core feature of national identity. Michael Billig argues forcefully that wi},

@inproceedings{blasi95_devel_ident_15,
 abstract     = {In this paper an argument is presented, suggesting that the concept of identity articulated by Erikson and reflected in ordinary pretheoretical understanding includes, as a central feature, a special experience of self, namely, the experience of a unified psychological "essence," from which superficial characteristics of the person are differentiated. However, as is shown through a close analysis of various identity measures, this subjective experiential aspect is typically neglected in identity research, including the many studies that were guided by the identity status paradigm. A new approach is then presented, aimed at recapturing the subjective meaning of identity, by viewing identity as a modality of the self as subject and as characterized by specific experiences of agency, unity, otherness, and individuality. In an effort to empirically ground this approach, a typology of identity experience, derived from Loevinger′s ego development stages, is described. Several studies are then reviewed, that confirm the viability of this typology and illustrate the advantages of studying identity from the perspective of the self as subject.},

This article reviews the problems with this practice, including near universal misinterpretation of p as the probability that H₀ is false, the misinterpretation that its complement is the probability of successful replication, and the mistaken assumption that if one rejects H₀ one thereby affirms the theory that led to the test. Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested. For generalization, psychologists must finally rely, as has been done in all the older sciences, on replication.},

The rules, norms, and shared strategies are constituted and reconstituted by human interaction in frequently occurring or repetitive situations. The syntax of the grammar identifies components of institutions and sorts them into three types of institutional statements: rules, norms, and shared strategies. We introduce the grammar, outline methods for operationalizing the syntax, apply the syntax to an analysis of cooperation in collective dilemma situations, and discuss the pragmatics of the grammar for analyses of behavior within complex institutional settings.},

When the underlying runtime system does not provide fault tolerance transparently, classical approaches to implementing fault tolerance mechanisms often imply mixing functional programming with non-functional programming (e.g. error processing mechanisms). The use of reflection improves the transparency of fault tolerance mechanisms to the programmer and more generally provides a clearer separation between functional and non-functional programming. The implementations of some classical replication techniques using a reflective approach are presented in detail and illustrated by several examples, which have been prototyped on a network of Unix workstations.

Using a resistance framework, we note that these women recall their initial heroin use in ways that suggest rejection of restrictive gender and class expectations. Using a dynamic view of resistance, we begin to understand how these women attempt to resist the dominant discourse through their heroin use and to reinterpret their experiences with heroin.},

Identity pattern had similar relationships across sample with vector dimensions of the California Psychological Inventory but was related to work and family outcomes only in the younger cohorts, whose lives were less restricted. Women with the achieved-foreclosed pattern were more alike across cohort than women with the achieved-moratorium pattern. Among the latter, independence and high aspirations were salient salient features of the younger cohorts, whereas interest in motives of self and others were salient in the older cohort.},

@article{holt95_how_consum_consum_22,
 abstract     = {This article examines what people do when they consume. In recent interpretive consumer research, three research streams have emerged, each portraying how people consume through a distinctive metaphor: consuming as experience, consuming as integration, and consuming as classification. The research reported here-a two-year observational case study of baseball spectators in Chicago's Wrigley Field bleachers-builds on this literature to systematically detail the universe of actions that constitute consuming. The resulting typology refines, extends, and synthesizes the three existing approaches to consuming and adds a fourth dimension-consuming as play-to yield a comprehensive vocabulary for describing how consumers consume. The usefulness of the typology is demonstrated by applying it to develop an alternative conception of materialism as a style of consuming.},

@article{lamport95_tla_pictur_21,
 abstract     = {Back in the 50s and 60s, programmers used flowcharts. Eventually, guided by people like Dijkstra and Hoare, we learned that pictures were a bad way to describe programs because they collapsed under the weight of complexity, producing an incomprehensible spaghetti of boxes and arrows. In the great tradition of learning from our mistakes how to make the same mistake again, many people decided that drawing pictures was a wonderful way to specify systems. So, they devised graphical specification languages. Not wanting to be outdone, I wrote this paper to show that you can write TLA specifications by drawing pictures. It describes how to interpret as TLA formulas the typical circles and arrows with which people describe state transitions. These diagrams represent safety properties. I could also have added some baroque conventions for adding liveness properties to the pictures, but there's a limit to how silly I will get. When I wrote the paper, I actually did think that pictures might be useful for explaining parts of specifications. But I have yet to encounter any real example where they would have helped. This paper contains, to my knowledge, the only incorrect "theorem" I have ever published. It illustrates that I can be as lazy as anyone in not bothering to check "obvious" assertions. I didn't published a correction because the theorem, which requires an additional hypothesis, was essentially a footnote and didn't affect the main point of the paper. Also, I was curious to see if anyone would notice the error. Apparently, no one did. I discovered the error in writing [115].},

The authors introduce the concept of the hypothesis objects, and augment the production rule format by adding the hypothesis condition elements in the LHS part of a rule, which control the forward and backward chaining invocation of rules. To be applied to the backward chaining, a modified version of the Rete network has been formulated by adding the hypothesis-and-nodes and backward direction edges to the node network generated by the Rete algorithm. The authors then develop a backward chaining algorithm which takes advantage of already existing partial match results obtained by the previous forward chaining. The forward and backward chaining can be naturally integrated via the generation of hypotheses from forward chaining inference. The whole mixed inference process has the potential advantages over purely forward and backward chaining strategy},

@inproceedings{mizoguchi95_task_,
 abstract     = {Normal human subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a simple visual manual reaction-time (RT) task with lateralized brief stimuli, the so-called Poffenberger's paradigm. This paradigm was employed to measure interhemispheric transmission (IT) time by subtracting mean RT for the uncrossed hemifield-hand conditions, that is, those conditions not requiring an IT, from the crossed hemifield-hand conditions, that is, those conditions requiring an IT to relay visual information from the hemisphere of entry to the hemisphere subserving the response. The obtained difference is widely believed to reflect callosal conduction time, but so far there is no direct physiological evidence in humans. The aim of our experiment was twofold: first, to test the hypothesis that IT of visuomotor information requires the corpus callosum and to identify the cortical areas specifically activated during IT. Second, we sought to discover whether IT occurs mainly at premotor or perceptual stages of information processing. We found significant activations in a number of frontal, parietal, and temporal cortical areas and in the genu of the corpus callosum. These activations were present only in the crossed conditions and therefore were specifically related to IT. No selective activation was present in the uncrossed conditions. The location of the activated callosal and cortical areas suggests that IT occurs mainly, but not exclusively, at premotor level. These results provide clear cut evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the crossed-uncrossed difference in the Poffenberger paradigm depends on IT rather than on a differential hemispheric activation.},

@article{nakata95_meta_level_contr_archit_produc_system_7,
 abstract     = {Recent production system applications have been experiencing exceedingly difficult software maintenance problems. This is because the control of rule firings has been buried in the production rules themselves. To cope with this problem, we propose a meta-level control architecture for production systems, where procedural programming languages, such as Lisp and C, are employed to explicitly describe the control plans of production systems. The key idea of the architecture is to view production systems as a collection of independent rule processes, each of which monitors the global database and performs actions when its conditions are satisfied by the database. Procedural Control Macros (PCMs), which are based on Hoare's CSP, are then introduced into procedural programming languages to establish communication with the collection of rule processes. Although the PCMs are simple and easy to implement, the readability and maintainability of production system applications are greatly enhanced. Together with the original facilities of procedural languages, the PCMs enable users to efficiently specify the control plans for production systems. Furthermore, since control information is gathered into control plans, production rules can be declarative and thereby application-independent. This new feature makes it possible to develop large-scale shared rule bases. Experiments of redescribing 370 rules have been performed based on the proposed meta-level control architecture. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the readability and maintainability of those rules without any significant representation (file volumes) and runtime (processing time) overheads.},

Theoretical formal- izations of such agents and their implementations have proceeded in parallel with little or no connection between them. This paper explores a particular type of rational agent, a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent. The primary aim of this paper is to integrate (a) the theoretical foundations of BDI agents from both a quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a symbolic reasoning perspective; (b) the implementations of BDI agents from an ideal theoretical perspective and a more practical perspective; and (c) the building of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. In particular, an air-traffic management application will be described from both a theoretical and an implementation perspective.},

@thesis{rummery95_probl_,
 abstract     = {This thesis is concerned with practical issues surrounding the application of reinforcement learning techniques to tasks that take place in high dimensional continuous state-space environments. In particular, the extension of on-line updating methods is considered, where the term implies systems that learn as each experience arrives, rather than storing the experiences for use in a separate oo-line learning phase. Firstly, the use of alternative update rules in place of standard Q-learning (Watkins 1989) is examined to provide faster convergence rates. Secondly, the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks (Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams 1986) is investigated to provide suitable generalising function approximators. Finally, consideration is given to the combination of Adaptive Heuristic Critic (AHC) methods and Q-learning to produce systems combining the beneets of real-valued actions and discrete switching. The diierent update rules examined are based on Q-learning combined with the TD() algorithm (Sutton 1988). Several new algorithms, including Modiied Q-Learning and Summation Q-Learning, are examined, as well as alternatives such a s Q () (P eng and Williams 1994). In addition, algorithms are presented for applying these Q-learning up-dates to train MLPs on-line during trials, as opposed to the backward-replay m e t h o d u s e d by Lin (1993b) that requires waiting until the end of each trial before updating can occur. The performance of the update rules is compared on the Race Track problem of Barto, Bradtke and Singh (1993) using a lookup table representation for the Q-function. Some of the methods are found to perform almost as well as Real-Time Dynamic Programming, despite the fact that the latter has the advantage of a full world model. The performance of the connectionist algorithms is compared on a larger and more complex robot navigation problem. Here a simulated mobile robot is trained to guide itself to a goal position in the presence of obstacles. The robot must rely on limited sensory feedback from its surroundings and make decisions that can be generalised to arbitrary layouts of obstacles. These simulations show that the performance of on-line learning algorithms is less sensitive to the choice of training parameters than backward-replay, and that the alternative Q-learning rules of Modiied Q-Learning and Q() a r e more robust than standard Q-learning updates. Finally, a c o m bination of real-valued AHC and Q-learning, called Q-AHC learning, is presented, and various architectures are compared in performance on the robot prob-lem. The resulting reinforcement learning system has the properties of providing on-line training, parallel computation, generalising function approximation, and continuous vector actions.
