Maximum-likelihood multivariatie-Gaussian (MLMVG) hypotheses testing is a common example of such a statistical pattern rognition technique. It is shown that the use of out of class covariance matrices can significantly reduce the run-time computations required to make MLMVG decisions. The Analysis directly leads to an objective dimensionality reduction (ODR) technique that indicate the preferred, intrinsic dimensionality omultiple class decision spaces given the training data. Run-time computatio/ns are reduced even further using these reduced dimension class decision spaces with dimensionality reduction technique to stress the essential concepts of out-of-class covariance. The theory has been applied to a nine(9) class, twenty-seven (27) feature, automatic visual solder joint inspection problem with excellent results; run-time computations are reduced by more than a factor of three while maintaining excellent design performance.},

@techreport{Cartwright84,
 abstract     = {To accommodate polymorphic data types and operations, several computer scientists - most notably MacQueen, Plotkin, and Sethi -- have proposed formalizing types as ideas. Although this approach is intuitively appealing, the resulting type system is both complex and restrictive because the type constructor that creates function types in [sic] not monotonic, and hence not computable. As a result, types cannot be treated as data values, precluding the formalization of type constructors and polymorphic program modules (where types are values) as higher order computable functions. Moreover, recursive definitions of new types do not necessarily have solutions. .sp sp This paper proposes a new formulation of types -- called intervals-- that subsumes the theory of types as ideals, yet avoids the pathologies caused by non-monotonic type constructors. In particular, the set of interval types contains the set of ideal types as a proper subset and all the primitive type operations on intervals are extensions of the corresponding operations on ideas. Nevertheless, all of the primitive interval type constructors including the function type constructor and type quantifiers are computable operations. Consequently, types are higher order data values that can be freely manipulated within programs.},

 abstract     = {.br br A Prolog machine design and its control are described. The machine features two-stage pipelining, a triple bus interconnection data path and support for concurrent control of micro-operations. The objective of this design is to improve execution of a Prolog processor by simultaneously performing multiple micro-operations. Capabilities of concurrent operation support are described in detail and demonstrated using some example Prolog functions. Two-stage pipeline technique as applied to non-deterministic control of Prolog program execution will be presented. .br br 37 pages.....\$4.35},

This paper sketches Rhetorical Structure Theory, which has been designed to support text generation, and then applies RST to describing a particular class of discourse constructs. .sp sp There is no consensus as to the status of clause combining relations relative to larger texts. This paper demonstrates a clause combining relation that is also found as part of larger text structures, and shows how this fact can be used to explain cases in which contrastive clause combining appears between clauses that are not in fact in contrast. The appropriate generalization is that the relations of clause combining and the relations of general text structure are the same. Use of this generalization should make AI text planning and text generation significantly easier.},

 abstract     = {approx. 52 pages .sp 1 sp 1 One of the tasks in designing a text generation system is to organize the environment of the grammatical component of the generation system in such a way that it supports the grammatical resources in generation. This report discusses the methods used for the Penman generation system to infer aspects of the organization of the knowledge base and other components of the environments of the Nigel grammar of the Penman system. It is shown how the design task can be broken down into a number of very explicit demands on the environment. In the main part of the report, the results of application of such an approach is sketched, with particular emphasis on the general organization of the knowledge base and the discourse model parts of the environment.},

 abstract     = {approx. 55 pages .sp sp SYSTEMIC GRAMMAR AND FUNCTIONAL UNIFICATION GRAMMAR: Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) and Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) are superficially very different approaches to grammatical knowledge, but they share an underlying comparability that runs very deep. FUG shares with systemic descriptions an emphasis on the functions of linguistic objects, and an explicit representation of feature choices. This paper explores how a systemic grammar can be represented in FUG notation, as a step toward creating a grammatical analysis program for English. Because FUG has been developed as a computational tool, expressing a systemic grammar in FUG notation allows new computational techniques to be applied to it. Among other benefits, this program will make it possible to study how much the grammatical functions of sentences are recoverable from them. It will also provide a method to test the amount of ambiguity implicit in a systemic description, a topic which has so far been inaccessible. This use of FUG as an alternate representation for SFG may have some additional benefits for both frameworks. It provides some solutions to problems in systemic notation which are described by Matthiessen (in this volume). Several extensions to the FUG framework are also suggested by this study. .sp sp REPRESENTATIONAL ISSUES IN SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR: Nigel is a large diverse computational grammar for text generation. Its framework is an implementation of Systemic Functional Theory of grammar and it constitutes a context in which the representation of systemic theory can be explored and studied. .sp sp This paper surveys the representational devices used in the Nigel grammar and the representational issues that they raise in relation to systemic theory. These issues are diagnosed in the light of the metafunctional differentiation of systemic theory.},

Current expert systems address this problem either by engineering the rule set to avoid it, or by using a single integration technique built into the interpreter, e.g., certainty factor combination. We argue that multiple techniques are needed and that their use -- and underlying assumptions -- should be made explicit. We identify some of the techniques used in MYCIN's therapy selection algorithm to integrate the diverse goals it attempts to satisfy, and suggest how knowledge of such techniques could be used to support construction, explanation, and maintenance of expert systems.},

We show that theory links may be 'activated' in much the same manner as ordinary links when inferencing with respect to the given set of clauses. Several link deletion results are shown to hold for theory links, and several examples, including Schubert's Steamroller, are presented using first-order theory links.},

These demands are stated in a logical language. A network knowledge base organizes the concepts of the application domain into categories known to the generator. The logical expressions are interpreted by the generator using the knowledge base and a restricted, but efficient, hybrid knowledge representation system. The success of this experiment has led to plans for the inclusion of this design in both the evolving Penman natural language generator and the Janus natural language interface.},

Four Lisp programs were translated into Common Lisp and Prolog abstract machine instruction sets. The translated programs were emulated and memory reference counts collected. Memory usage statistics indicate how the two languages do fundamental computations different ways with varying efficiency. Additional measurements of production systems running on a conventional host are presented.},
