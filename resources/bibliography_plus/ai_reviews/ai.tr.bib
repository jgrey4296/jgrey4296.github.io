Maximum-likelihood multivariatie-Gaussian (MLMVG) hypotheses testing is a common example of such a statistical pattern rognition technique. It is shown that the use of out of class covariance matrices can significantly reduce the run-time computations required to make MLMVG decisions. The Analysis directly leads to an objective dimensionality reduction (ODR) technique that indicate the preferred, intrinsic dimensionality omultiple class decision spaces given the training data. Run-time computatio/ns are reduced even further using these reduced dimension class decision spaces with dimensionality reduction technique to stress the essential concepts of out-of-class covariance. The theory has been applied to a nine(9) class, twenty-seven (27) feature, automatic visual solder joint inspection problem with excellent results; run-time computations are reduced by more than a factor of three while maintaining excellent design performance.},

 abstract     = {To accommodate polymorphic data types and operations, several computer scientists - most notably MacQueen, Plotkin, and Sethi -- have proposed formalizing types as ideas. Although this approach is intuitively appealing, the resulting type system is both complex and restrictive because the type constructor that creates function types in [sic] not monotonic, and hence not computable. As a result, types cannot be treated as data values, precluding the formalization of type constructors and polymorphic program modules (where types are values) as higher order computable functions. Moreover, recursive definitions of new types do not necessarily have solutions. .sp sp This paper proposes a new formulation of types -- called intervals-- that subsumes the theory of types as ideals, yet avoids the pathologies caused by non-monotonic type constructors. In particular, the set of interval types contains the set of ideal types as a proper subset and all the primitive type operations on intervals are extensions of the corresponding operations on ideas. Nevertheless, all of the primitive interval type constructors including the function type constructor and type quantifiers are computable operations. Consequently, types are higher order data values that can be freely manipulated within programs.},

NIKL has been in use for several years and our experiences have led us to define and implement various extensions to the language, its support environment and the implementation. Our experiences are particular to the use of NIKL. However, the requirements that we have discovered are relevant to any intelligent system that must reason about terminology. This article reports on the extensions that we have found necessary based on experiences in several different testbeds. The motivations for the extensions and future plans are also presented.},

The machine features two-stage pipelining, a triple bus interconnection data path and support for concurrent control of micro-operations. The objective of this design is to improve execution of a Prolog processor by simultaneously performing multiple micro-operations. Capabilities of concurrent operation support are described in detail and demonstrated using some example Prolog functions. Two-stage pipeline technique as applied to non-deterministic control of Prolog program execution will be presented. .br br 37 pages.....\$4.35},

This paper demonstrates a clause combining relation that is also found as part of larger text structures, and shows how this fact can be used to explain cases in which contrastive clause combining appears between clauses that are not in fact in contrast.

 abstract     = {approx. 55 pages .sp sp SYSTEMIC GRAMMAR AND FUNCTIONAL UNIFICATION GRAMMAR: Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) and Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) are superficially very different approaches to grammatical knowledge, but they share an underlying comparability that runs very deep. FUG shares with systemic descriptions an emphasis on the functions of linguistic objects, and an explicit representation of feature choices. This paper explores how a systemic grammar can be represented in FUG notation, as a step toward creating a grammatical analysis program for English. Because FUG has been developed as a computational tool, expressing a systemic grammar in FUG notation allows new computational techniques to be applied to it. Among other benefits, this program will make it possible to study how much the grammatical functions of sentences are recoverable from them. It will also provide a method to test the amount of ambiguity implicit in a systemic description, a topic which has so far been inaccessible. This use of FUG as an alternate representation for SFG may have some additional benefits for both frameworks. It provides some solutions to problems in systemic notation which are described by Matthiessen (in this volume). Several extensions to the FUG framework are also suggested by this study. .sp sp REPRESENTATIONAL ISSUES IN SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR: Nigel is a large diverse computational grammar for text generation. Its framework is an implementation of Systemic Functional Theory of grammar and it constitutes a context in which the representation of systemic theory can be explored and studied. .sp sp This paper surveys the representational devices used in the Nigel grammar and the representational issues that they raise in relation to systemic theory. These issues are diagnosed in the light of the metafunctional differentiation of systemic theory.},

We argue that multiple techniques are needed and that their use -- and underlying assumptions -- should be made explicit. We identify some of the techniques used in MYCIN's therapy selection algorithm to integrate the diverse goals it attempts to satisfy, and suggest how knowledge of such techniques could be used to support construction, explanation, and maintenance of expert systems.},

The logical expressions are interpreted by the generator using the knowledge base and a restricted, but efficient, hybrid knowledge representation system. The success of this experiment has led to plans for the inclusion of this design in both the evolving Penman natural language generator and the Janus natural language interface.},
