 abstract     = {This paper considers resource allocation in a network with mobile agents competing for computational priority. We formulate this problem as a multi-agent game with the players being agents purchasing service from a common server. We show that there exists a computable Nash equilibrium when agents have perfect information into the future. From our game, we build a market-based CPU allocation policy and a strategy with which an agent may plan its expenditures for a multi-hop itinerary. We simulate a network of hosts and agents using our strategy to show that our resource-allocation mechanism effectively prioritizes agents according to their endowments and that our planning algorithm handles network delay gracefully.},

 abstract     = {The University of Mitchigan Digital Library (UMDL) is designed as an open system that allows third parties to build and integrate their own profit-seeking agents into the Market Place of information goods and services. The profit-seeking agents, however, risks inefficient allocation of goods and services, as agents take strategic stances that might back fire. While it woiuld be good if we could impose mechanisms to remove incentives for strategic reasoning, this is not possible in the UMDL. Therefore, our approach has instead been to study whether encouraging the other extreme - making strategic reasoning ubiquitous- provides an answer. Towards this end, we have designed a strategy (called the p-strategy) that uses a stochastic model of the market to find the best offer price. We have then examined the collective behaviour of p-strategy agents in the UMDL auction. Our experiments show that strategic thinking is not always beneficial and that the advantage of being strategic decreases with the arrival of equally strategic agents. Furthermore, a simpler strategy can be as effective when enough other agents ise the p-strategy. Consequently, we expect the UMDL is likelu to evlove to a point where some agents use simpler strategies and some use the p-strategy.},

 abstract     = {In search for market equilibrium in multicommodity markets, price-oriented schemes are normally used. That is, a set of prices (one price for each commodity) is updated until supply meets demand for each commodity. In some cases such as an approach is rather inefficient, and a resource-oriented scheme can be highly competitive. In a resource-oriented shceme the allocations are up-dated until the market equilibrium is found. It is well known that in two-commodity market resource-oriented schemes are possible. In this article we show that resource-oriented allgorithms can be used for the general multicommodity case as well, and present and analyze an algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented and some performance properties, for a specific example, are presented.},

 abstract     = {Automated negoitation and coalition formation among self-interested agents are playing an increasingly important role in electronic commerce. Such agents cannot be coordinated by externally imposing their strategies. INstead the interaction protocols have to be designed so that each agent is motivated to follow the strategy that the protocol designer wants it to follow. This paper reviews six component technologies that we have developed for making such interactions less manipulable and more efficient in terms of the computational processes and the outcomes: \begin{enumerate} \item OCSM - contracts in marginal cost based contracting, \item leveled committment contacts, \item anytime coalition structure generation with worse case guarantees, \item trading off computation cost against optimisation quality within each coalition, \item distribution search among insincere agents, and \item unenforced contract execution. \end{enumerate} Each of these technologies represents a different way of battling self-interest and combinatorial complexity simultaneously. This is a key battle when multi-agent systems move into large-scale open settings.},

In particular, it considers the problem of giving a verifiable semantics for such languages - a semantics where conformance (or otherwise) to the semanitcs could be determined by the independent observer. These problems are precisely defined in an abstract formal framework. Using this framework, a number of example agent communication frameworks are defined. A discussion is then presented, of the various options open to designers of agent communication languages, with respect the problem of verifying conformance.},

In this paper, we present the TuCSoN coordination model for Internet applications based on network-aware and mobile agents, and show how the adoption of TuCSoN can positively benefit the design and development of such applications, firstly in general terms, then via a TuCSoN-coordinated sample application. This is achieved by providing for an Internet interaction space made up of a multiplicity of independently programmable communication abstractions, called tuple centres, whose behaviour can be defined so as to embody the laws of coordination.},

In this paper it is argued that the low-level infrastructure of the Web is badly suited for these new applications, as well as being somewhat inefficient in its original applications; an alternative infrastructure offering better performance and flexibility is proposed. The new infrastructure is based on the Linda coordination model, and adds a layer of abstraction over the absolute location of resources. Both theoretical and real-world issues are covered, including the problem of integrating this new system with the existing infrastructure of the Web.},

 abstract     = {Although avatars may resemble communicative interface agents, they have for the most part not profited from recent research into autonomous embodied conversational systems. In particular, even though avatars function within conversational environments (for example, chat or games), and even though they often resemble humans (with a head, hands, and a body) they are incapable of representing the kinds of knowledge that humans have about how to use the body during communication. Humans, however, do make extensive use of the visual channel for interaction management where many subtle and even involuntary cues are read from stance, gaze and gesture. We argue that the modeling and animation of such fundamental behavior is crucial for the credibility and effectiveness of the virtual interaction in chat. By treating the avatar as a communicative agent, we propose a method to automate the animation of important communicative behavior, deriving from work in conversation and discourse theory. BodyChat is a system that allows users to communicate via text while their avatars automatically animate attention, salutations, turn taking, back-channel feedback and facial expression. An evaluation shows that users found an avatar with autonomous conversational behaviors to be more natural than avatars whose behaviors they controlled, and to increase the perceived expressiveness of the conversation. Interestingly, users also felt that avatars with autonomous communicative behaviors provided a greater sense of user control.},

 abstract     = {Dynamic linking provides functionality that is necessary for secure flexible use of mobile programs but it introduces a new class of runtime errors - unbound procedure names. In this chapter, we present a compiler-directed technique for safe dynamic linking for mobile programs. Our technique guarantees that linking failures can occur only when a program arrives at a new execution site and that this failure can be delivered to the program as an error code or an exception. We use interprocedural analysis to identify the set of names that must be linked at the different sites the program executes on. We use a combination of runtime and compile-time techniques to identify the calling context and to link only the names needed in that context. Our technique is able to handle recursive programs as well as separately compiled code that may itself be able to move. We discuss language constructs for controlling the behavior of dynamic linking and the implication of some of these constructs for application structure.},

 abstract     = {This paper evaluates the design and implementation of Omniware: a safe, efficient, and language-independent system for executing mobile program modules. Previous approaches to implementing mobile code rely on either language semantics or abstract machine interpretation to enforce safety. In the former case, the mobile code system sacrifices universality to gain safety by dictating a particular source language or type system. In the latter case, the mobile code system sacrifices performance to gain safety through abstract machine interpretation. Omniware uses software fault isolation, a technology developed to provide safe extension code for databases and operating systems, to achieve a unique combination of language-independence and excellent performance. Software fault isolation uses only the semantics of the underlying processor to determine whether a mobile code module can corrupt its execution environment. This separation of programming language implementation from program module safety enables our mobile code system to use a radically simplified virtual machine as its basis for portability. We measured the performance of Omniware using a suite of four SPEC92 programs on the Pentium, PowerPC, Mips, and Sparc processor architectures. Including the overhead for enforcing safety on all four processors, OmniVM executed the benchmark programs within 21\% as fast as the optimized, unsafe code produced by the vendor-supplied compiler.},

@article{Adorni93,
 abstract     = {In this work, we are presenting an object-oriented language to define distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) systems. This language allows for the description of control and communication management, a hierarchical representation of a DAI system at different levels of detail, and the simulation of its performance. The language is based on three different entities -- sequential actors, distributed actors and channel managers. A sequential actor describes a single DAI module (agent). A distributed actor represents a net of agents characterizing both a whole DAI system and its sub-parts. A channel manager administers channel communications among agents. This paper specifically illustrates (i) how data and procedural abstraction properties of such a language satisfy all the representation requirements for modelling DAI systems, and (ii) how message passing in an access-oriented paradigm can be an excellent basis for the representation of the mechanisms which drive the performance of a DAI system. We conclude with an example of the language application.},

The initial implementation of AOP, Agent-0, is a simple language for specifying agent behaviour. KQML provides a standard language for inter-agent communication. Our integration (which we have called Agent-K) demonstrates that Agent-0 and KQML are highly compatible. Agent-K provides the possibility of inter-operable (or open) software agents, that can communicate via KQML and which are programmed using the AOP approach.},

The key idea is that mental concepts (e.g. ``believes'', ``desires'', ``intends'', ``mood'', ``emotion'', etc.) are grounded in assumptions about information processing architectures, and not merely Newell's knowledge-level concepts, nor concepts based solely on Dennett's ``intentional stance.''},

 abstract     = {Research papers available on the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) are often poorly organized, often exist in forms opaque to search engines (e.g. Postscript), and increase in quantity daily. Significant amounts of time and effort are typically needed in order to find interesting and relevant publications on the Web. We have developed a Web based information agent that assists the user in the process of performing a scientific literature search. Given a set of keywords, the agent uses Web search engines and heuristics to locate and download papers. The papers are parsed in order to extract information features such as the abstract and individually identified citations. The agent's Web interface can be used to find relevant papers in the database using keyword searches, or by navigating the links between papers formed by the citations. Links to both ``citing'' and ``cited'' publications can be followed. In addition to simple browsing and keyword searches, the agent can find papers which are similar to a given paper using word information and by analyzing common citations made by the papers.},

 abstract     = {Deep Space One will be the first spacecraft to be controlled by an autonomous agent potentially capable of carrying out a complete mission with minimal commanding from Earth. The New Millennium Remote Agent (NMRA) includes a planner-scheduler that produces plans, and an executive that carries them out. In this paper we discuss several issues arising at the interface between planning and execution. Issues include execution latency, plan dispatchability, and the distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events. Temporal information in the plan is represented within the general framework of Simple Temporal Constraint networks, as introduced by Dechter, Meiri, and Pearl. However, the execution requirements have a substantial impact on the topology of the links and the propagation through the network.},

 abstract     = {The New Millennium Remote Agent (NMRA) will be the first AI system to control an actual spacecraft. The spacecraft domain places a strong premium on autonomy and requires dynamic recoveries and robust concurrent execution, all in the presence of tight real-time deadlines, changing goals, scarce resource constraints, and a wide variety of possible failures. To achieve this level of execution robustness, we have integrated a procedural executive based on generic procedures with a deductive model-based executive. A procedural executive provides sophisticated control constructs such as loops, parallel activity, locks, and synchronization which are used for robust schedule execution, hierarchical task decomposition, and routine configuration management. A deductive executive provides algorithms for sophisticated state inference and optimal failure recovery planning. The integrated executive enables designers to code knowledge via a combination of procedures and declarative models, yielding a rich modeling capability suitable to the challenges of real spacecraft control. The interface between the two executives ensures both that recovery sequences are smoothly merged into high-level schedule execution and that a high degree of reactivity is retained to effectively handle additional failures during recovery.},

This language is based on an object, called agent, (i) performing private actions, (ii) communicating with other agents, and (iii) re-configuring system structure through the creation of other agents and changing its behaviour. The main feature of this language is the use of a large set of communication primitives, defined on the spirit of Speech Act theory, which are suitable to model agent interactions and which can be specialised to implement specific communication protocols. In particular, the paper shows how these primitives are suitable to model negotiation protocols.},

@inproceedings{amati96,
 abstract     = {With the development and diffusion of the Internet worldwide connection, a large amount of information can be delivered to the users. To avoid their being overflowed by the incoming data, methods of information filtering are required. Thus, there is the problem of determining what information is relevant to the user and how this decision can be taken by a supporting system. Parametric and qualitative descriptors of user's interest must be generated. This paper presents two approaches. The first concerns an information filtering system based on an adaptation of the generalized probabilistic model of information retrieval. The user profile is a vector of weighted terms which are learned from the relevance assessment values given by the user on the training set. Positive terms are considered relevant to the informative need of the user, negative ones irrelevant. The relevance values are interpreted as subjective probabilities and hence are mapped into the real interval [0; 1]. ProFile is a filtering system for the netnews which uses this model with a scale of 11 predefined values of relevance. ProFile allows the user to update on-line his profile and to check the discrepancy between his assessment and the prediction of relevance of the system. The second concerns the InfoAgent, a system for supporting users in retrieving data in distributed and heterogeneous archives and repositories. The architecture is based on the metaphor of the software agents and incorporates innovative hints from other fields: distributed architectures, relevance feedback and active interfaces. The system has a cooperative and supportive role: it understands the user's needs and learns from his behavior. Its aim is to disengage the user from learning complex tools and from performing tedious and repetitive actions.},

 abstract     = {Electronic commerce is emerging as one of the most important applications on the Internet, with the potential to revolutionize the whole structure of retail merchandising and shopping. There is already a need for an information technology infrastructure that goes well beyond the simple capabilities offered by the current development environments for Internet applications. For electronic commerce to really take off, however, it will have to give shoppers options not available through traditional commercial channels. This implies the further need for an infrastructure that can support complex and flexible services to manage customer-tailored requests in the context of highly dynamic networks and federations of providers. To address these issues, we developed XPect, a generic framework for electronic commerce. The XPect framework supports the integration of multiple component functionalities. It is implemented in the Coordination Language Facility, an object-based distributed application development tool that assumes an object model of autonomous agents that can engage in interactions more sophisticated than those in the traditional object paradigm. In addition, CLF allows for dynamically adding new services and for coordinating the access to multiple services.},

 abstract     = {An often claimed benefit of mobile agent technology is the reduction of communication cost. Especially the area of information filtering has been proposed for the application of mobile filter agents. However, an effective coordination of agents, which takes into account the current network conditions, is difficult to achieve. This contribution analyses the situation that data distributed among various remote data servers has to be examined with mobile filter agents. We present an approach for coordinating the agents' employment, which minimizes communication costs. Validation studies on the possible cost savings for various constellations show that savings up to 90% can be achieved in the face of actual Internet conditions.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents an environment for the development of multi-agent systems that integrates agent and object-oriented programming paradigms. In fact, this environment, called HOMAGE, offers two different programming levels: object and agent. The object level allows the use of three object-oriented programming languages (C++, Common Lisp and Java) to develop the components that will be used to build the body of agents. The agent level allows the development of new agents by defining their ``brain'' and by composing the components defined at the object level, and allows the development of multi-agent systems by distributing and interconnecting agent instances. Moreover, these multi-agent systems can be distributed on a net of heterogeneous machines connected through internet taking advantage of a set of communication and distribution libraries allowing the communication between agents through different protocols. The paper includes a brief description of a robotic application that we implemented during the experimentation of the environment.},

@inproceedings{atal98:wooldridge,
 abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the issue of designing agents that successfully balance the amount of time spent in reconsidering their intentions against the amount of time spent acting to achieve them. Following a brief review of the various ways in which this problem has previously been analysed, we motivate and introduce a simple formal model of agents, which is closely related to the well-known belief-desire-intention model. In this model, an agent is explicitly equipped with mechanisms for deliberation and action selection, as well as a meta-level control function, which allows the agent to choose between deliberation and action. Using the formal model, we define what it means for an agent to be optimal with respect to a task environment, and explore how various properties of an agent's task environment can impose certain requirements on its deliberation and meta-level control components. We then show how the model can capture a number of interesting practical reasoning scenarios, and illustrate how our notion of meta-level control can easily be extended to encompass higherorder meta-level reasoning. We conclude with a discussion and pointers to future work.},

 abstract     = {Partial failures and network outages are handled well by two-stage commit transaction protocols. This should have important applications for distributed processing. But the size and complexity of transaction processing systems tends to limit their use. In contrast with most other transaction processing systems, AXTP is small and easy to use. It is a component-based system, written using Java Beans, and can be configured to a wide range of requirements. AXTP is built on top of UDP/IP, rather than TCP. This has a number of advantages: 1. Connection management is eliminaged - only a single socket is needed, 2. TCP-specific restrictions relating to broadband, satellite, and cellular phones no longer apply, and 3. Number of packets needed for a minimum transaction is only 4, while TCP requires 7 just to open a connection. AXTP uses XML for its wire protocol, and employes decaying retry timers to greatly simplify recovery from communication failures. Another interesting characteristic of AXTP is that the client is untrusted. All activity relating to a single transaction must pass through a single server. Transactions must be of an approved duration and are aborted by the server when the time limit is exceeded. (For multi-tier transactions, only the top-level server may abort a transaction.)},

We evaluate the opportunities offered by this approach and provide feasibility considerations, also discussing a few interim architectural solutions adopted in our on-going implementation work.},

 abstract     = {This paper explores the process of representing and classifying conflicts in agent-based systems. These capabilities form the basis for an in-progress implementation of a domain-independent conflict management framework for multi-agent environments. The following hypothesis is to be tested under this implementation: the most appropriate conflict resolution strategy for a given conflict is contingent on the type of conflict, the agents' organizational role, and the agents' solution preferences. A three layered representation of conflict is employed (i.e. goal, plan, belief). The representation serves to trace the source(s) of conflict and provides a map to potential resolutions. Each layer of the representation is assigned an associated conflict type reflecting the source of the conflict (i.e. what must be changed to eliminate the conflict: goals, plans, or beliefs). A formal definition of these three conflict classes is provided. The ongoing implementation of these concepts through the Sensible Agent testbed is discussed.},

Sensible agents are agents that operate in a multi-agent based system with the ability to dynamically adapt their level of autonomy. Conflicts are classified as goal, plan and belief conflicts. It is shown that such a classification is useful in developing effective conflict detection and resolution mechanisms. The conflict classification and detection algorithm developed in this paper is used in the conflict resolution module - the Conflict Resolution Advisor, of Sensible Agents. An example illustrates the application of this scheme to a simple shop floor routing example},

@techreport{barber:99,
 abstract     = {Agent-based systems require flexibility to perform effectively in complex and dynamic environments. Previous research has identified numerous motivations for adaptability in agent-based systems; however, the extent of this adaptability can be expanded. This paper shows that agents should be able to benefit from controlling the problem-solving frameworks (also called planning-interaction frameworks) under which they plan for their goals. Dynamic Adaptive Autonomy (DAA) allows agents to control their planning-interaction styles, called autonomy levels, along a defined spectrum (from command-driven to consensus to locally autonomous/master). This allows agents to dynamically form, modify, or dissolve goal-oriented problem-solving groups. This paper presents one motivation for DAA through experiments showing that the best type of problem-solving framework for a group of agents depends not only on the problem domain and the pre-defined characteristics of the system, but also on run-time factors that can change during system operation. Thus, it is possible for agents to benefit from the capability to dynamically adapt their problem-solving framework to their situation.},

In this paper we propose a functional decomposition of problem solving activities to serve as a framework to assist MAS designers in their selection and integration of different techniques and existing research results according to their system requirements. The basic phases include agent organization construction, plan generation, task allocation, plan integration, and plan execution. An example usage of the proposed model for the domain of naval radar frequency management is also presented.},

Current work in the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort has addressed the information contentlevel by the KIF language and the intentional level by the KQML langauge. In this paper we address the coordination level by means of our coordination language (COOL) that relies on speech act based communication, but integrates it in a stuctured conversation framework that captures the coordination mechanisms agents use when working together. We are currently using this language (i) to represent coordination mechanisms for the supply chain of manufacturing modeled as intelligent agents, and (ii) as an environment fo rdesigning and validating coordination protocols for multi-agent systems. This paper describes the basic elements of this language: conversation objects, conversation rules, error recovery rules, continuation rules, conversation nesting. The actual COOL source code and a running trace for the n-queens problem are presented in the Appendix.},

 abstract     = {When AI studies autonomous agents, it traditionally strives for intelligence in those agents. However, autonomous agents are increasingly used in areas related to art, entertainment, and user interface. Established fields of art and entertainment (such as film, literature, and theater) depend on believable characters more than intelligent ones. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the AI research community to study a new kind of autonomous agent, where the focus is on believability, not intelligence. I will argue that this opportunity exists, summarize the goals I see for believable agents researchs, and try to explain the key differences between believability and traditional scientific goals such as intelligence and realism. I will conclude with the suggestion that AI's founding dreams demand both intelligence and believability.},

@phdthesis{Baumann,
 abstract     = {In this thesis several control mechanisms for mobile agents are proposed, i.e. mechanisms for locating and for terminating mobile agents and for orphan detection in a mobile agent system. First, control mechanisms are discussed that have been specifically designed for mobile agent systems, taking into account the peculiarities of the mobile agent paradigm. The energy concept is presented, which supports orphan detection for mobile agents. Then the path concept will be discussed, a variant of which is used in the area of distributed systems to track mobile objects. The third concept presented is the shadow concept. This concept supports locating and terminating of mobile agents and furthermore, provides orphan detection for mobile agent systems. We discuss for each of these concepts fault tolerance and message complexity. In the area of distributed algorithms, mechanisms have been developed to solve similar problems (i.e. termination detection and distributed garbage collection). It has been proved that the class of termination detection algorithms and the class of garbage collection algorithms are identical. Using a transformation, an algorithm of one class can be changed into an algorithm of the other class and vice versa. In fact, new algorithms were discovered this way. A similar transformation providing the conversion of either of these classes into control algorithms for mobile agents should allow access to a large number of algorithms for controlling mobile agents. But the failure model of the area of distributed algorithms and of the area of mobile agents are radically different, ruling out the direct use of these mechanisms. Instead we will use transformed garbage collection algorithms to show the following: all the principles of the transformed algorithms can be found in the control mechanisms developed explicitly for mobile agents.},

@inproceedings{baumann97:communication,
 abstract     = {Driven by the question how to identify potential communication partners and the need for well-suited communication schemes in agent-based systems, we discuss two communication concepts: sessions and global event management. Sessions establish either actively or passively a context for inter-agent interactions. Communication partners are addressed by globally unique agent identifiers or via badges. Communication in sessions is based on RPC or message mechanisms. Global event management addresses the need for anonymous communication. Event managers are employed as a synchronization means within agent groups. Based on this approach, we introduce synchronization objects, -- active components that offer various synchronization services. The presented model is finally mapped onto OMG event services.},

 abstract     = {Mole is one of the first Java-based mobile agent systems. It runs on an unmodified Java virtual machine on PCs under Windows 95/NT and on Workstations under several UNIX dialects. Earlier versions of Mole have provided a basic infrastructure for communication and migration of mobile agents. Version of Mole has been strongly revised and several requests and proposals from users of the earlier ver sions of Mole were integrated into the new release. In particular Mole supports communication between agent groups and concept of sessions. The infrastructure of Mole includes a resource manager, a direc tory service and a global naming scheme for agents. In order to support the design of agents, a graphical agent monitor allows to visualize the system behaviour as a whole or of a single agent in particular. Mole further provides a thread management unit to overcome some shortcomings of the Java virtual machine. Mole provides a simple means for installation and configuration of the system. This paper describes the architecture and infrastructure provided by Version 3.0 of Mole.},

In this paper we introduce our model of agent groups in mobile agent environ ments. Various entities of an agent group are consecutively identified and their roles within an electronic market scenario thoroughly pictured. We argue that with the ac curate employment of the provided agent group primitives the system's flexibility can be significantly enhanced: user applications can, for example, trade performance against fault-tolerance.},

It takes the view that rational agents do not change their attitudes without reason, and aims to represent such changes in teleological theories. the infrastructure of these theories contain persistence rules which state that agents attitudes persist unless they have reason to change them. Theories giving the agents' reasons for changing their attitudes build on these. This leads to a discussion of rationality in resource-bounded agents and the paper concludes by outlining an AI-planning theory of rational agency.},

Such applications are not tied to one user or one machine, and can roam freely over the network, rendering service to a community of users, gathering human input and interacting with people. We envisage that this will support many new agent-based collaboration metaphors. The ability to migrate executing programs has applicability to mobile computing as well. Users can have their applications travel with them, as they move from one computing environment to another. We present an elegant programming model for creating migratory applications and describe an implementation. The biggest strength of our implementation is that the details of migration are completely hidden from the application programmer; arbitrary user interface applications can be migrated by a single ``migration'' command. We address system issues such as robustness, persistence and memory usage, and also human factors relating to application design the interaction metaphor and safety.},

@phdthesis{bordini,
 abstract     = {This thesis proposes the use of Cultural Anthropology as a source of inspiration for solutions to the problem of adaptation of autonomous, intelligent, computational agents that migrate to societies of agents with distinctive features from the ones of the society where those agents were originally conceived. This has implications for interoperation of disparate Multi-Agent Systems. In particular, the cognitive approach to anthropology is argued to be a suitable theoretical foundation for this topic. Fieldwork practice in social anthropology is also indicated as a useful source of ideas. A pragmatic theory of intensionality is incorporated in this anthropological approach, resulting in a mechanism that allows agents to ascribe intensional ontologies of terms to societies that use unfamiliar means of communication; also, taxonomical relations among the terms in such ontologies can be retrieved, by means of a process inspired by the counterpart activity of ethnographers. This is presented using the Z notation for formal specification of systems, and illustrated on a set of terms from the game of cricket. Subsequently, a simulation of a game of cricket is described where one of the players is unfamiliar with the game, and therefore needs to learn the game by observing the other players. A reasonable behaviour for such a player is obtained, and the simulation offers grounds for further anthropologically-based studies. Further, a study of theories of moral sentiments is presented, and the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is used in simulations based on those ideas. The results of the simulations show clearly the positive impact, on groups of agents, of altruistic behaviour; this can only be coherently obtained in autonomous agents by modelling emotions, which are relevant for this project as anthropologists recognise them as an essential cross-cultural link. Finally, the consequences of this project to conceptions of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are discussed.},

We propose that mobile agents purchase resource access rights from host machines thereby establishing a market for computational resources and giving agents a metric to evenly distribute themselves throughout the network. Market participation requires quantitative information about resource consumption to define demand and calculate utility. \par We create a formal utility model to derive user-demand functions, allowing agents to efficiently plan expenditure and deal with price fluctuations. By quantifying demand and utility, resource owners can precisely set a value for a good. We simulate our model in a mobile agent scheduling environment and show how mobile agents may use server prices to distribute themselves evenly throughout a network.},

 abstract     = {A mobile agent is an executing program that can migrate during execution from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. On each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other resources to accomplish its task. Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information-retrieval applications. By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency. In this chapter, we first discuss the strengths of mobile agents, and argue that although none of these strengths are unique to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all of them. Next, after surveying several representative mobile-agent systems, we examine one specific information-retrieval application, searching distributed collections of technical reports, and consider how mobile agents can be used to implement this application efficiently and easily. Then we spend the bulk of the chapter describing two planning services that allow mobile agents to deal with dynamic network environments and information resources: (1) planning algorithms that let an agent choose the best migration path through the network, given its current task and the current network conditions, and (2) planning algorithms that tell an agent how to observe a changing set of documents in a way that detects changes as soon as possible while minimizing overhead. Finally, we consider the types of errors that can occur when information from multiple sources is merged and filtered, and argue that the structure of a mobile-agent application determines the extent to which these errors affect the final result.},

 abstract     = {There are important limitations in the usability of the World Wide Web. We believe that some of these limitations can be circumvented by using agent-like entities. We are working on developing components of an architecture for supporting the development of these entities. These components include high-level HTTP stream transducers, independent browsing associates, methods of encapsulating non-Web data such as email, and communications protocols to allow our services to communicate with each other and their users. We have built example services using these components and toolkits for making these components easier to use.},

Hence the agents must be equipped with a communication module that allows them to take active part in the negotiation process of the society. Further there have to be a set of keywords and a protocol which define a kind of interlingua. After a detailed motivation, the role of speech acts as a basis for a communication architecture for cooperating agents will be discussed. Viewing them as actions the agents have to perform, the planning aspects will be elaborated. A formal model of communication will then be given which leads, together with the speech act planning, to the communication architecture.},

Such applications are not tied to one user or one machine, and can roam freely over the network, rendering service to a community of users, gathering human input and interacting with people. We envisage that this will support many new agent-based collaboration metaphors. The ability to migrate executing programs has applicability to mobile computing as well. Users can have their applications travel with them, as they move from one computing environment to another. We present an elegant programming model for creating migratory applications and describe an implementation. The biggest strength of our implementation is that the details of migration are completely hidden from the application programmer; arbitrary user interface applications can be migrated by a single `migration' command. We address system issues such as robustness, persistence and memory usage, and also human factors relating to the application design process, the interaction metaphor and safety.},

 abstract     = {Most current computer applications are insensitive to changing conditions. With the growing demand for wireless. satellite, and other highly volatile computer communications networks, however, applications that are robust in the presence of network volatility must be designed and built. Network-robust applications are of great interest in military situations today, and we expect that interest to grow in industrial and eventually consumer environments as well. Mobile agents are one way to realize such applications, especially when used in a wireless environment. This article discusses issues and results related to the problem of making computer applications network-aware and reactive to changing network conditions. It contains a short overview of our work on mobile agents as well as a tutorial on network sensing from the agent perspective. Some prototypes of network-sensing systems and network aware mobile-agent applications are presented.},

Searching for an optimal interactive strategy is a hard problem because it depends mostly on the behavior of the others. In this work, interaction among agents is represented as a repeated two-player game, where the agents' objective is to look for a strategy that maximizes their expected sum of rewards in the game. We assume that agents' strategies can be modeled as finite automata. A model-based approach is presented as a possible method for learning an effective interactive strategy. First, we describe how an agent should find an optimal strategy against a given model. Second, we present an unsupervised algorithm that infers a model of the opponent's automaton from its input/output behavior. A set of experiments that show the potential merit of the algorithm is reported as well.},

Recently, {\em mobile code languages} (MCLs) have been proposed as a technological answer to the problem. In this work, we abstract away from the details of these languages by deriving design paradigms exploiting code mobility that are independent of any particular technology. We present such design paradigms, together with a discussion of their features, their application domain, and some hints about the selection of the correct paradigm for a given distributed application.},

 abstract     = {This paper concerns the development of interfaces which perform tasks on behalf of the user. Recently the concept of task delegation has gained consideration due to the increasing number of assignments that are quite repetitive and tedious, like dealing with electronic messages, managing personal agendas, retrieving data and information in remote and distributed repositories. These tasks are generally connected to the development of computer networks. The design of such interfaces presents a high degree of complexity since the relationship with the user and his needs is very critical: in most cases the user wants to control the jobs to be mechanized but in the same time he wants to be free from wasting his time in performing repetitive patterns of actions. In this paper the main problems concerning the design of active and cooperative interfaces are investigated. Then a solution is proposed based on the approaches of software agents and distributed architectures. Starting point of the project is to integrate and make accessible different tools and applications regularly utilized by a user: all these elements concur in building a flexible and scalable environment that the user can access through intelligent agents that work as interfaces.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are programs, typically written in a script language, which may be dispatched from a client computer and transported to a remote server computer for execution. Several authors have suggested that mobile agents offer an important new method of performing transactions and information retrieval in networks. Other writers have pointed out, however, that mobile agent introduce severe concerns for security. We consider the advantages offered by mobile agents and assess them against alternate methods of achieving the same function. We conclude that, while the individual advantages of agents do not represent an overwhelming motivation for their adoption, the creatoin of a pervasive agent framework facilitates a very large number of network services and applications.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes an abstract framework for itinerant agents that can be used to implement secure, remote applications in large, public networks such as the Internet or the IBM Global Network. Itinerant agents are programs, dispatched from a source computer, that roam among a set of networked servers until they accomplish their task. This is an extension to the client / server model in which the client sends a portion of itself to the server for execution. An additional feature of itinerant agents is their ability to migrate from server to server, perhaps seeking one that can help with the user's task or perhaps collecting information from all of them. A major focus of the paper is the Agent Meeting Point, an abstraction that supports the interaction of agents with each other and server based resources.},

 abstract     = {In this chapter we are going to analyze mobile code issues in the perspective of object oriented systems in which thread migration is not supported. This means that both object's code and data can be transmitted from a place to another but not the current execution state (if any) associated to the object. This is the case with the Java language which is often used in the WWW for developing applets which are little applications downloaded on the fly and executed in the client machine. While this mechanism is quite useful for enhancing HTML documents with sound and animation, we think that this technology can give its best in the field of distributed-cooperative work, both in the perspective of Internet and Intranet connectivity. Java is indeed a concurrent, multithreaded language, but it offers little help for distributed programming. Thus, we introduce Jada, a coordination toolkit for Java where coordination among either concurrent threads or distributed Java objects is achieved via shared object spaces. By exchanging objects through tuple spaces, Java programs and applets can exchange data or synchronize their actions over a single host, a LAN, or even the Internet. The access to an object space is performed using a set of methods of the ObjectSpace class. Such operations are Out (to put an object in the object space), In and Read (to get or to read associatively an object from the object space), and others, mostly inspired by the Linda language. Jada does not extends the syntax of Java because it is a set of classes. We show how it changes the way we design multiuser, distributed applications (such as the ones based on the WWW) allowing easy interactions between software components and agents. Under this perspective we can outline a system of any scale which uses the dynamic linking capability of Java to distribute the code and the coordination facility of Jada to handle distributed entities inter-relations.},

 abstract     = {With the continuing exponential growth of the Internet and the more recent growth of business Intranets, the commercial world is becoming increasingly aware of the problem of electronic information overload. This has encouraged interest in developing agents/softbots that can act as electronic personal assistants and can develop and adapt representations of users information needs, commonly known as profiles. As the result of collaborative research with Friends of the Earth, an environmental issues campaigning organisation, we have developed a general purpose information classification agent architecture and have applied it to the problem of document classification and routing. Collaboration with Friends of the Earth allows us to test our ideas in a non-academic context involving high volumes of documents. We use the technique of genetic programming (GP), (Koza and Rice 1992), to evolve classifying agents. This is a novel approach for document classification, where each agent evolves a parse-tree representation of a user's particular information need. The other unusual features of our research are the longevity of our agents and the fact that they undergo a continual training process; feedback from the user enables the agent to adapt to the user's long-term information requirements.},

 abstract     = {In this paper we introduce a distributed object oriented programming language and we illustrate its use for building Internet wide agent based applications. The language, AprilQ++, is a macro implemented extension of the distributed symbolic programming language April. The ++ signifies that it is an OO extension of April bearing the same relationship to April as C++ does to C. The `Q' indicates an additional feature. The objects in AprilQ++ can have knowledge bases comprising sets of facts and recursive definitions of relations which can be queried, both locally and remotely, using Prolog style queries. AprilQ++ has one other significant feature. Using the higher order features of the underlying April, objects can be cloned, with the current state of the object encapsulated in a procedure closure. The clone can then migrate to be forked as a new active object running on a new host. This features enables us to implement mobile agents.},

By using this language for communication, agents will be able to request and deliver services to one another. Indeed, numerous projects have shown how the language can profitably support interoperation among distributed agents. However, before becoming a widely-accepted standard, it would be worthwhile to examine the language in detail. This paper explores semantical issues raised by KQML, specifically the use of performatives for interagent communication. Numerous difficulties with the language are identified, and an attempt is made to point to their resolution. The paper illustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessary to characterize agent communication languages, and applies it to compose a question from a request and an inform. Finally, the paper discusses possible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisions from the semantical issues raised here.},

While such a programming environment is adequate for many tasks, object-based RPC systems and statically compiled languages also have certain intrinsic limitations. These limitations become significant when writing applications which are both distributed and interactive (e.g. network information browsers, distributed conferencing systems and collaborative work tools). This paper discusses these limitations, and presents the design of Phantom, a new intepreted language for distributed programming. Phantom provides many features found in object-based RPC systems and statically compiled languages, including automatic marshalling, transparent remote procedure call, secure authentication and concurrency support. In addition to these traditional features, Phantom's interpreted nature permits the use of certain programming techniques, such as true object migration, remote evaluation, and dynamic extensibility, which are of increasing importance for distributed programming, but which are not available in statically compiled languages and RPC systems. The integration of these features in a single, coherent programming language makes whole new classes of distributed, interactive applications possible.},

This requires that the right effects of change need to be propagated through the plan and design. When this is distributed among designers and planners, no one may have all of the information to perform such propagation and it is important to identify what effects should be propagated to whom, and when. We describe a set of dependencies among plan and design elements that allow such notification by a set of message-passing software agents. The result is to provide a novel level of computer support for complex projects.},

@inproceedings{Cranefield:1995:ABI,
 abstract     = {Agent-Based Software Integration (ABSI) entails the development of intelligent software agents and knowledge-sharing protocols that enhance interoperability of multiple software packages. Although some past ABSI projects reported in the literature have been concerned with the integration of relatively large software frameworks from separate engineering disciplines, the discussion in this paper concerns the integration of general-purpose software utilities and hand-crafted tools. With such smaller-scale ABSI projects, it may be difficult to justify the expense of constructing an overall ontology for the application. There are cases, however, when the project involves general-purpose tools that manipulate the same general entity types (such as files) but at different levels of abstraction. In such cases it is appropriate to have ontologies appropriate for the general usage of each tool and constraint descriptions that enable the ontological specifications to be mapped across the various levels of abstraction. This paper discusses issues associated with this type of ABSI project and describes an example information management application associated with university course administration. For the information management application presented the key issues are the provision of standard agent wrappers for standard desktop information management tools and the design of standard ontologies describing information stored in relational databases as well as in structured text files. Examples of a conceptual model describing such a database ontology are presented in connection with the example application. It also suggested that a general planning agent, distinct from the notion of a facilitator agent, be employed in this context to assist in the use of various agents to manipulate information and move items from one data format to another.},

 abstract     = {The Mobile Agent paradigm seems to be a promising and innovative technology for developing applications in open, distributed and heterogeneous environments because it can overcome some of the limits of traditional Client/Server approaches. Many application areas, such as e-commerce, mobile computing, network management and information retrieval can benefit from the application of the MA technology. The widespread use of mobile agents is currently mainly limited by the lack of security, a requirement that should be faced when dealing with the Internet untrusted environment. The paper focuses on the problem of ensuring the integrity of agents in these environments and presents a range of solution strategies. In particular, it describes and compares two different approaches to achieve agent integrity. The first one makes use of a Trusted Third Party entity, while the second one is based on a distributed protocol that does not assume any secure collaborating entity. The two solutions suite different areas, and we have integrated them in a flexible support for a wide range of applications, called Secure and Open Mobile Agent (SOMA).},

@article{cybenko:3dcad,
 abstract     = {Industry estimates show that aggressive reuse of existing inventory could reduce the delivered cost of large, complex manufactured systems by as much as 20\%. In most cases these savings are not captured, principally because the current technology to locate reusable designs and inventory, which uses taxonomies and other artificial indices, is too cumbersome. Furthermore, current systems do not address the design phase - where opportunities for reuse first arise. This paper describes a computer-based technology that will be an important step towards solving this problem. \par For mechanical parts, the modern design phase starts with computer aided design (CAD) packages. Given a prototype design of a solid object, the design engineer should be able to determine whether the part under consideration is already designed or in manufacture. Our system does this by using physical shape as a direct index to existing designs and manufactured components, eliminating time-consuming and error-prone searches of the taxonomy. Other applications of this technology include identification of warehoused parts according to scanned shape and efficient management of 3-dimensional objects in computer animation and virtual reality systems. \par Our system takes a standard digital representation of a solid object, such as in IGES form, and produces a surface triangular mesh representing the boundary of the object. The surface mesh allows a voxel approximation representation of the solid which is computed by flood filling. Zeroth, first and second order geometrical moments are used to normalize the orientation of the solid. Then a variety of volumetric invariants are computed and used as features. These features determine a hash function which maps similar shapes to closely related feature vectors. Nearby feature vectors identify a small subset of objects which are compared using symmetric differencing on a voxel by voxel basis. This voxel symmetric difference gives a rank ordering of similarity between 3-dimensional shapes in the database and the object under consideration. Using this small subset of like-shaped objects, the design engineer can browse a reasonable subset of parts from the complete database. \par The described research has significant applications in industries which seek to reuse existing designs and inventory thereby reducing manufacturing costs. Applications in aerospace, automobile and machine tool industries are most promising and urgent. We expect that this research will lead to the commercial development of software that will enhance existing CAD and database systems.},

@inproceedings{cybenko:functional,
 abstract     = {In most working and proposed multiagent systems, the problem of identifying and locating agents that can provide specific services is a major problem of concern. A broker or matchmaker service is often proposed as a solution. These systems use keywords drawn from application domain ontologies to specify agent service, usually framed within some some sort of knowledge representation language . However, we believe that keywords and ontologies cannot be defined and interpreted precisely enough to make broking or matchmaking among agents sufficiently robust in a truly distributed, heterogeneous , multiagent computing environment. This creates matching conflicts between a client agents' requested functionality and a service agents' actual functionality . We propose a new form of interagent communication, called functional validation, specially designed to solve such matching conflicts. In this paper we introduce the functional validation concept, analyze the possible situations that can arise in validation problems and formalize the mathematical framework around which further work can be done.},

It became clear that the field should shift its emphasis toward mobile code, in all its forms, rather than to continue its narrow focus on mobile agents. Furthermore, we encourage the development of modular components, so that application designers may take advantage of code mobility without needing to rewrite their application to fit in a monolithic mobile-agent system. There are many potential applications that may productively use mobile code, but there is no ``killer application'' for mobile agents. Finally, we note that although security is an important and challenging problem, there are many applications and environments with security requirements well within the capability of existing mobile-code and mobile-agent frameworks.},

These resources are often distributed across a network and can contain tremendous quantities of data. One of the paradigms that has been suggested for allowing efficient access to such resources is transportable agents -- the agent is sent to the machine that maintains the information resource; the agent executes on this remote machine and then returns its results to the local machine. We have implemented a transportable agent system that uses the Tool Command Language (Tcl) as the agent language. Each Tcl script can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport itself to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. The execution state of the script -- which includes the commands that have not been executed -- must be transmitted to the new machine. Although the execution state tends to be small, there will be a large number of agents moving across the network in a large-scale system. Thus it is desirable to compress the execution state as much as possible. Furthermore any compression scheme must be fast so that it does not become a bottleneck between the transportable agent system and the network routines. In this paper we explore several fast compression methods.},

Mobile agents have the potential to provide a {\em single, general framework} in which a wide range of distributed applications can be implemented efficiently and easily. Several challenges must be faced, however, most notably reducing migration overhead, protecting a machine from malicious agents (and an agent from malicious machines), and insulating the agent against network and machine failures. Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system under development at Dartmouth College that has evolved from a Tcl-only system into a multiple-language system that currently supports Tcl, Java, and Scheme. In this thesis, we examine the motivation behind mobile agents, describe the base Agent Tcl system and its security mechanisms for protecting a machine against malicious agents, and analyze the system's current performance. Finally, we discuss the security, fault-tolerance and performance enhancements that will be necessary for Agent Tcl and mobile agents in general to realize their full potential.},

Jasper can summarise and extract keywords from WWW pages and can share information among users with similar interests automatically. Jasper provides agents which can retrieve relevant WWW pages quickly and easily. A Jasper agent holds a profile of its user, based on observing their behaviour and learning more about their interests as the system is used. A novel three-dimensional front end for the Jasper system has been created using VRML (virtual reality modelling language), a language for 3-D graphical spaces or virtual worlds networked via the global Internet and hyperlinked within WWW. This and other ongoing research using keyword and document clustering techniques are described.},

These flaws arise for several reasons, including implementation errors, unintended interactions between browser features, differences between the Java language and bytecode semantics, and weaknesses in the design of the language and the bytecode format. On a deeper level, these flaws arise because of weaknesses in the design methodology used in creating Java and the browsers. In addition to the flaws, we discuss the underlying tension between the openness desired by Web application writers and the security needs of their users, and we suggest how both might be accommodated.},

This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP allows more agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction.},

 abstract     = {One of the basic questions of research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is how agents have to be structured and organized, and what functionalities they need in order to be able to act and to interact in a dynamic environment. To cope with this question is the purpose of models and architectures for autonomous and intelligent agents.\par In the first part of this report, {\sc InteRRaP}, an agent architecture for multi-agent systems is presented. The basic idea is to combine the use of patterns of behaviour with planning facilities in order to be able to exploit the advantages both of the reactive, behaviour-based and of the deliberate, plan-based paradigm. Patterns of behaviour allow an agent to react flexibly to changes in its environment. What is considered necessary for the performance of more sophisticated tasks is the ability of devising plans deliberately. A further important feature of the model is that it explicitly represents knowledge and strategies for cooperation. This makes it suitable for describing high-level interaction among autonomous agents.\par In the second part of the report, the loading-dock domain is presented, which has been the first application the {\sc InteRRaP} agent model has been tested with. An automated loading-dock is described where the agent society consists of forklifts which have to load and unload trucks in a shared, dynamic environment.},

 abstract     = {An overview on aspects about cooperating agents is presented. As multiagent systems are various, we start with a classification of multiagent systems which is particularly influenced by an article from Decker, Durfee, and Lesser [Decker\& 89]. In the following, the aspects of communication, planning, and negotiation are examined. On the occasion of communication, the discussion is split into: no communication -- simple protocols -- artificial languages. The planning aspect is broken into sections: from classical to multiagent planning -- a general multiagent planning theory -- intention -- intention-directed multiagent planning. Finally, a summary of Brigitte and Hassan L\^{a}asri and Victor Lesser's negotiation theory will be presented.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a comparative survey of formalisms related to mobile agents. It describes the $\pi$-calculus and its extensions, the Ambient calculus, Petri nets, Actors, and the family of generative communication languages. Each of these formalisms defines a mathematical framework that can be used to reason about mobile code; they vary greatly in the mechanisms they provide to specify mobile code based applications and in their practical usefulness for the validation and the verification of such applications. In this paper we show how these formalisms can be used to represent the mobility and communication aspects of two mobile code environments: Obliq and Messengers. We compare and classify the different formalisms with respect to mobility and discuss some shortcomings and desirable extensions. We also point to other emerging concepts in formalisms for mobile code systems.},

 abstract     = {Over the years, many different agent programming languages have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a concept called Agent Programs using which, the way an agent should act in various situations can be declaratively specified by the creator of that agent. Agent Programs may be built on top of arbitrary pieces of software code and may be used to specify what an agent is obliged to do, what an agent may do, and what an agent may not do. In this paper, we define several successively more sophisticated and epistemically satisfying declarative semantics for agent programs. We further show that agent programs cleanly extend well understood semantics for logic programs, and thus are clearly linked to existing results on logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning.},

In particular, we develop algorithms for the above semantics, and describe results on their computational complexity.

Using computation spaces, the paper covers several inference engines ranging from standard search strategies to techniques new to constraint programming, including limited discrepancy search, visual search, and saturation. Saturation is an inference method for tautology-checking used in industrial practice. Computation spaces have shown their practicability in the constraint programming system Oz.},

In computer science one try to solve this problem by rigid formalisation and rules, constraining infrastructures, security devices, etc. I think that a more socially oriented approach is also needed. My point is that Social Control - and in particular decentralised and autonomous Social Control - will be one of the most effective approaches.},

First, the MAS's dynamics interact in complex ways with those of its environment, and agent engineers need to distinguish the two. Second, ``mean field'' approximations of the behavior of the system may be useful for qualitative examination of the dynamics, but can differ surprisingly from the behavior that emerges from the interactions of discrete agents. This paper examines these effects in the context of a project applying synthetic pheromones for agent-based control to a military air operations scenario.},

The aim of this work is to explore the capabilities of both paradigms in improving the design and development of open and distributed systems. Our goal is to add compositional characteristics to mobile agents by defining an agent-based compositional model. We take advantage of the mobility and the composition capability by applying this model to the problem of searching software components in partially-instantiated applications, both in design and run time. That is, the abstract components of an architectural design of an application can be fulfilled with concrete ones by retrieving them from the Internet.},

This model allows for a simple description of both individual and collective multi-agent system aspects. The framework we use to give a formal description of this model is based on a multi-formalism approach. We illustrate this approach through a case study.},

Then, we introduce the concept of boundary interface as a methodological abstraction for the engineering of active systems, which allow observer agents to be provided with three different kind of consistent system views, featuring observable, controlled, and constrained consistency, respectively.},

Agent-oriented software engineering introduces a new level, called agent level, to allow the software architect modeling a system in terms of interacting agents. This level of abstraction is not yet supported by an accepted diagrammatic notation even if a number of proposals are available. This paper shows how standard UML can be exploited to design a multi-agent system at the agent level. In particular, it presents a set of agent-oriented diagrams intended to provide an UML-based notation to model: the architecture of the multi-agent system, the ontology followed by agents and the interaction protocols used to coordinate agents. The presented notation exploits stereotypes to associate an agent-oriented semantic with class and collaboration diagrams. Therefore, it can be managed with any off-the-shelf CASE tool supporting UML.},

 abstract     = {The design and development of Internet applications can take advantage of a paradigm based on autonomous and mobile agents. However, agent mobility introduces peculiar coordination problems in Internet applications. First, it suggests the exploitation of an infrastructure based on a multiplicity of local interaction spaces. Second, it may require coordination activities to be adapted both to the characteristics of the execution environment where they occur and to the needs of the application to which the coordinating agents belong. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of context-dependent coordination based on programmable interaction spaces. On the one hand, interaction spaces associated to different execution environments may be independently programmed so as to lead to differentiated, environment-dependent, behaviors. On the other hand, agents can program the interaction spaces of the visited execution environments to obtain an application-dependent behavior of the interaction spaces themselves. Several examples show how a model of context-dependent coordination can be effectively exploited in Internet applications based on mobile agents. In addition, several systems are briefly presented that, to different extent, define a model of context-dependent coordination.},

 abstract     = {In this paper, we present a multi-agent systems approach to distributed event-data processing as it is e.g. pervasive in scientific computing environments. The task investigated is the one of configuration and execution of event-data processing pipelines to be assembled from single computational services (agents) that perform an asynchronous mapping of streams of inputs to streams of outputs, where the specification is given in terms of characterization of the final output of the pipeline. \par Comprehensive declarative descriptions of the capabilities of single agents in such a system can be shown to be computationally intractable because of the complexity of the mapping between the inputs and outputs of individual agents. We therefore investigate the consequences of circumventing this problem by only publishing the capabilities of the outputs of agents, performing the transformation of output requirements to input requirements opaquely within individual agents, and utilizing recursive runtime contracting to configure complete data processing pipelines. \par The information loss entailed by this kind of information propagation opens up the possibility of pipeline misconfigurations that in turn lead to runtime exceptions when constraints between interfaces that were not explicitly enforced by the published capability descriptions are violated. We characterize the ensuing coordination needs and related design requirements for such kinds of multi-agent systems and propose the introduction of social laws as a promising principled solution approach to be further researched.},

 abstract     = {While recent decades have brought substantial change to the form of the operating system interface, the power of operating system commands has remained nearly constant. Conventional commands, whether visual or textual, specify one particular action to perform. To carry out a complex task, such as reducing disk utilization, the user is forced to explicitly specify each of the necessary steps. Traditional command-language extension mechanisms, such as shell scripts and pipes, enable the user to aggregate and compose various commands, but force him or her to write and debug programs -- a formidable challenge for naive users. This paper presents a goal-oriented approach to the operating system command interface, realized through an implementation we call OS agents. Using OS agents, the user simply specifies a goal to accomplish, and the OS agent decides how to accomplish that goal using its knowledge base of the system state and its commands. The OS agent dynamically synthesizes the appropriate command sequence, issues the required commands and system calls, handles errors, and retries commands if necessary. With OS agents, we have applied AI planning and learning techniques to the operating system environment to increase the power of the user's commands.},

The Explorer is a fast and memory efficient tool intended for the development of real-world constraint programs. The Explorer is implemented in Oz using first-class computation spaces. There is no fixed search strategy in Oz. Instead, first-class computation spaces allow to program search engines. The Explorer is one particular example of a user-guided search engine. The use of recomputation to trade space for time makes it possible to solve large real-world problems, which would use too much memory otherwise.},

Despite its many practical benefits, mobile agent technology results in significant new security threats from malicious agents and hosts. The primary added complication is that, as an agent traverses multiple hosts that are trusted to different degrees, its state can change in ways that adversely impact its functionality. In this paper, we discuss achievable security goals for mobile agents, and we propose an architecture to achieve these goals. The architecture models the trust relations between the principals of mobile agent systems. A unique aspect of the architecture is a ``state appraisal'' mechanism that protects users and hosts from attacks via state modifications and that provides users with flexible control over the authority of their agents.},

Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one cornerstone assumption of the field is that communication is expensive relative to local computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. This paper considers how automated agents could use a coordination technique common to communication-free human interactions, namely {\em focal points}. Given a problem and a set of possible solutions from which the agents need to choose one, focal points are prominent solutions of the problem to which agents are drawn. Theoretical work on this subject includes~\cite{schelling63,kraus91a}. The purpose of the current research is to consider the practical use of focal point techniques in various domains. We present simulations over randomly generated domains; these simulations strongly suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination in real-world environments.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a new architecture for controlling autonomous agents in dynamic multi-agent worlds, building on previous work addressing reactive and deliberative control methods. The proposed multi-layered architecture allows a rationally bounded, goal-directed agent to reason predictively about potential conflicts by constructing causal theories which explain other agents' observed behaviors and hypothesize their intentions; at the same time it enables the agent to operate autonomously and to react promptly to changes in its real-time environment. A principal aim of this research is to understand the role different functional capabilities play in constraining an agent's behavior under varying environmental conditions. To this end, an experimental testbed has been constructed comprising a simulated multi-agent world in which a variety of agent configurations and behaviors have been investigated. A number of experimental findings are reported.},

@incollection{franz97:adapative,
 abstract     = {We are designing and implementing a flexible infrastructure for mobile-object systems. Two fundamental innovations distinguish our architecture from other proposed solutions. First, our representation of mobile code is based on adaptive compression of syntax trees. Not only is this representation more than twice as dense as Java byte-codes, but it also encodes semantic information on a much higher level than linear abstract-machine representations such as p-code or Java byte-codes. The extra structural information that is contained in our mobile-code format is directly beneficial for advanced code optimizations. \par Second, our architecture achieves superior run-time performance by integrating the activity of generating executable code into the operating system itself. Rather than being an auxiliary function performed off-line by a stand-alone compiler, code generation constitutes a central, indispensable service in our system. Our integral code generator has two distinct modes of operation: instantaneous load-time translation and continuous dynamic re-optimization. \par In contrast to just-in-time compilers that translate individual procedures on a call-by-call basis, our system's integral code-generator translates complete code-closures in a single burst during loading. This has the apparent disadvantage that it introduces a minor delay prior to the start of execution. As a consequence, to some extent we have to favor compilation speed over code quality at load time. \par But then, the second operation mode of our embedded code generator soon corrects this shortcoming. Central to our run-time architecture is a thread of activity that continually optimizes all of the already executing software in the background. Since this is strictly a re-compilation of already existing code, and since it occurs completely in the background, speed is not critical, so that aggressive, albeit slow, optimization techniques can be employed. Upon completion, the previously executing version of the same code is supplanted by the newly generated one and re-optimization starts over. By constructing globally optimized code-images from mobile software components, our architecture is able to reconcile dynamic composability with the run-time efficiency of monolithic applications.},

This is done by a special server extension module called 'server agent environment' (SAE). The agents may access local data of the Web server and may communicate with other Web-agents or with human users. The paper discusses the different security issues that arise in such a system and shows how we address the problems. Concerning system and network security, we present a solution based on security packages, protection domains, and agent capabilities. This provides a flexible way to restrict an agent's possibility to access the local server data or access the network. Since we also aim at providing our SAE as a plug-in for other Web servers, we show how this is supported by our system architecture.},

Other advantages of the navigational programming style include the ability to compute in unknown or dynamically changing network topologies.},

@phdthesis{galliers:88,
 abstract     = {This thesis describes a theoretical framework for modelling cooperative dialogue. The linguistic theory is a version of speech act theory adopted from Cohen and Levesque, in which dialogue utterances are generated and interpreted pragmatically in the context of a theory of rational interaction. The latter is expressed as explicitly and formally represented principles of rational agenthood and cooperative interaction. The focus is the development of strategic principles of multi-agent interaction as such a basis for cooperative dialogue. In contrast to the majority of existing work, these acknowledge the positive role of conflict to multi-agent cooperation, and make no assumptions regarding the benevolence and sincerity of agents. The result is a framework wherein agents can resolve conflicts by negotiation. It is a preliminary stage to the future building of computer models of cooperative dialogue for both HCI and DAI, which will therefore be more widely and generally applicable than those currently in existence. The theory of conflict and cooperation is expressed in the different patterns of mental states which characterize multi-agent conflict, cooperation and indifference as three alternative postural relations. Agents can recognize and potentially create these. Dialogue actions are the strategic tools with which mental states can be manipulated, whilst acknowledging that agents are autonomous over their mental states; they have control over what they acquire and reveal in dialogue. Strategic principles of belief and goal adoption are described in terms of the relationships between autonomous agents' beliefs, goals, preferences, and interests, and the relation of these to action. Veracity, mendacity, concealing and revealing are defined as properties of acts. The role of all these elements in reasoning about dialogue action and conflict resolution, is testea in analyses of two example dialogues; a record of a real trade union negotiation and an extract from ``Othello'' by Shakespeare.},

Although we may have some intuitions about how some parameters could affect the scheduling efficiency and meeting quality, we run several experiments in order to explore the tradeoffs between different parameters. Our experiments show how the calendar and preference privacy affect the schedulling efficiency and the meeting joint quality under different experimental scenarios. The results show how the schedulling performance is more stable and constant when agents try to keep both calendar and preference privacy. We believe that these parameters play a key role in the distributed meeting scheduling task, specially if we are interested in building distributed systems with truly autonomous and independent agents where there is not a fixed centralized host agent.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a heterogeneous, asynchronous architecture for controlling autonomous mobile robots which is capable of controlling a robot performing multiple tasks in real time in noisy, unpredictable environments. The architecture produces behavior which is reliable, task-directed (and taskable), and reactive to contingencies. Experiments on real and simulated real-world robots are described. The architecture smoothly integrates planning and reacting by performing these two functions asynchronously using heterogeneous architectural elements, and using the results of planning to guide the robot's actions but not to control them directly. The architecture can thus be viewed as a concrete implementation of Agre and Chapman's plans-as-communications theory. The central result of this work is to show that completely unmodified classical AI programming methodologies using centralized world models can be usefully incorporated into real-world embedded reactive systems.},

It is indicated how AI techniques differ from conventional programming techniques and how they extend far beyond those provided by so-called expert systems. Some of the major areas of AI, including natural language understanding, problem solving, and computer vision, are then discussed. It is shown how industry can utilize these technologies by considering some recent work in three areas: real-time control of NASA's space shuttle, reasoning among multiple systems, and just-in-time scheduling. Finally, some of the outstanding problems in AI are described.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes research concerned with automating the monitoring and control of spacecraft systems. In particular, the paper examines the application of SRI's Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) to the handling of malfunctions in the Reaction Control System (RCS) of NASA's space shuttle. Unlike traditional monitoring and control systems, PRS is able to reason about and perform complex tasks in a very flexible and robust manner, somewhat in the manner of a human assistant. Using various RCS malfunctions as examples (including sensor faults, leaking components, multiple alarms, and regulator and jet failures), it is shown how PRS manages to combine both goal-directed reasoning and the ability to react rapidly to unanticipated changes in its environment. In conclusion, some important issues in the design of PRS are reviewed and future enhancements are indicated.},

Despite the promising first steps, there is still confusion on the role of paradigms and technology in the development on applications based on the mobile computation paradigm.

It is argued that such an architecture has the potential to provide a distributed, robust and efficient means of traffic management for telecommunications networks. Some preliminary work on the design of the trading behaviour of the agents in the economy is presented, including the results of experiments which investigate the relative performance of market-based agents compared with traffic management based on static routing.},

 abstract     = {Many popular programs, such as Netscape, use untrusted helper applications to process data from the network. Unfortunately, the unauthenticated network data they interpret could well have been created by an adversary, and the helper applications are usually too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore, it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted helper applications. We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting the program's access to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean, user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted helper applications. Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing applications.},

To address this problem, we have developed a multistrategy system that combines two learning methods: operationalization of high-level advice provided by a human and incremental refinement by a genetic algorithm. The first method generates seed rules for finer-grained refinements by the genetic algorithm. Our multistrategy learning system is evaluated on two complex simulated domains as well as with a Nomad 200 robot.},

For example, adaptation risks introducing undesirable side effects, thereby making agents' behavior less predictable. Furthermore, although formal verification can assist in ensuring behavioral predictability, it is known to be time-consuming. The goal of this research is to develop agents that are adaptive and predictable and timely. At first blush, these three requirements seem contradictory. For example, adaptation risks introducing undesirable side effects, thereby making agents' behavior less predictable. Furthermore, although formal verification can assist in ensuring behavioral predictability, it is known to be time-consuming. \par Our solution to the challenge of satisfying all three requirements is the following. Agents have finite-state automaton plans, which are adapted online via evolutionary learning (perturbation) operators. To ensure that critical behavioral constraints are always satisfied, agents' plans are first formally verified. They are then reverified after every adaptation. If reverification concludes that constraints are violated, the plans are repaired. The main objective of this paper is to improve the efficiency of reverification after learning, so that agents have a sufficiently rapid response time. We present two solutions: positive results that certain learning operators are a priori guaranteed to preserve useful classes of behavioral assurance constraints (which implies that no reverification is needed for these operators), and efficient incremental reverification algorithms for those learning operators that have negative a priori results.},

A transportable agent is a named program that can migrate from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. Such programs are a powerful tool for implementing information agents since the electronic resources in a user's information space are often distributed across a network and can contain tremendous quantities of data. Sending a user-specific program to the network location of the resource is often the most convenient and e<cient alternative. The goal of Agent Tcl is to address the weaknesses of existing transportable-agent systems. Agent Tcl will run on standard hardware, support multiple languages and transport mechanisms, provide transparent migration and communication, and provide effective security and fault-tolerance in the uncertain world of the Internet. This paper describes the architecture of Agent Tcl and its current implementation and presents four informationmanagement applications in which Agent Tcl has proven useful.},

 abstract     = {One of the paradigms that has been suggested for allowing efficient access to remote resources is transportable agents. A transportable agent is a named program that can migrate from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. The program chooses when and where to migrate. It can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. Transportable agents have several advantages over the traditional client/server model. Transportable agents consume less network bandwidth and do not require a connection between communicating machines -- this is attractive in all networks and particularly attractive in wireless networks. Transportable agents are a convenient paradigm for distributed computing since they hide the communication channels but not the location of the computation. Transportable agents allow clients and servers to program each other. However transportable agents pose numerous challenges such as security, privacy and efficiency. Existing transportable agent systems do not meet all of these challenges. In addition there has been no formal characterization of the performance of transportable agents. This thesis addresses these weakness. The thesis has two parts -- (1) formally characterize the performance of transportable agents through mathematical analysis and network simulation and (2) implement a complete transportable agent system.},

First we discuss mechanisms existing in D'Agents for protecting an individual machine: (1) cryptographic authentication of the agent's owner, (2) resource managers that make policy decisions based on the owner's identity, and (3) secure execution environments for each language that enforce the decisions of the resource managers. Then we discuss our planned market-based approach for protecting machine groups. Finally we consider several (partial) solutions for protecting an agent from a malicious machine.},

 abstract     = {The recent trend towards dynamically extensible systems holds the promise of more powerful and flexible systems. At the same time, the impact of extensibility on overall system security and, specifically, access control is still ill understood, and protection mechanisms in these extensible systems are rudimentary at best. In this paper, we identify the structure of extensible systems as it relates to system security, and present an access control mechanism that is user-friendly and complete. The mechanism, by using ideas first introduced by the security community, offers mandatory access control which can be used to enforce a given security policy. Additional discretionary access control allows users to express their own fine-grained access constraints. \par We introduce a new access mode, called the extend access mode, in addition to the familiar execute access mode, to reflect how extensions interact. Furthermore, in a departure from work in the security community, we treat both extensions and threads of control as subjects, i.e., as active entities, in order to correctly capture their interaction in an extensible system. We present the design of the access control mechanism and define a formal model. We describe an implementation of the access control mechanism in the SPIN extensible operating system, which allows us to evaluate its performance and to explore optimizations that reduce the overhead of access control. The measured end-to-end overhead of access control in our system is less than 2\%.},

We observe the availability of natural kinds of information, e.g., authority, reliability, freshness, and specificity, as teh basis for reasoning about precedence. by precedence we mean in the sense of resolving conflicts between rules on the basis of qualitative ordinal information. We propose an approach to this problem of conflict: via defaults and reasoning about such precendence. drewn from knowledge representation and commonsense reasoning. We initially developed this approach in previous work. Here, we elaborate it, abstract it to a more conceptual level, and present it for a machine learning audience. Also, we abstract it away from the details of, and dependency on, one aprticular non-monotonic logical formalism. We see the value of this approach not as being all-embracing, but as providing a step towards elements of future approaches to advice-taking and instruction.},

Besides basic inferencing, these include embeddability, reusability, user-friendly authoring of rules, communicability of rules, flexibility especially of inferencing control strategy and performance, and extensibility of representation and reasoning. We develop an architecture that fulfills these requirements to a substantial degree: RAISE (Reusable Agent Intelligence Software Environment). RAISE provides building blocks for embeddable agent smarts. It is founded upon a declarative representation and clean semantics, equipped with a sample yet powerful appraoch to procedural attachments. This results in highly pluggable components for inferenciing, authoring, and communication embodied in a fine-grained object-oriented class library. We have found RAISe to enable high reusability of both code and knowledge while embedding rule-based intelligence enhancements in three prototyped infromation agent applications: personal messaging, newgroups filtering and handling for customer service support (the Globenet system), and collaborative news service in Lotus Notes.},

Agent Building Environment ``situates'' reasoning by augmenting it with clean an d dynamic procedural attachments for perception and action. It is especially useful to enhance ``information-flow'' applications with agents that not only find and filter information items, but also categorize, save, and selectively disseminate them. Some of our latest research responding to practical building lessons includes: conflict handling; learning from observation of users; and learning from inter-agent knowledge-level communication.},

We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data.

 abstract     = {This article provides a specification of the reasoning processes that guide communicative actions of agents towards a potential cooperation. For this purpose we develop a formal theory with an internal perspective, which enables us to identify the key data structures and specify the relationships between them. The reasoning processes are described in terms of beliefs, desires and intentions of individual agents. The logical model of these attitudes are used to formally define a number of important states including agent to agent commitment. The reasoning processes are in essence the transitions through these states, specified by a set of rules as part of our specification language. As a result of these processes, an agent may adopt goals to communicate. These goals are fed back into the reasoning process to find appropriate communication plans that fulfill them. Our approach is therefore pragmatic since it enables a direct coupling of our theoretical concepts to an implementable model.},

 abstract     = {Rapid and increasing advances in telecommunications and distributed systems have broadened the arena of possibilites for challenging new applications such as electronic markets, distributed intelligent information services, distributed manufacturing control, cooperative multi-robot applications, and many more. These advances have enabled access to a wide variety of communication networks, offering various means for logically or geographically distributed nodes to connect and communicate. With these possibilities real challenges are converging onto problems requiring better software engineering solutions. As programs are becoming more sophisticated they may collaborate and negotiate with other programs in order to achieve their assigned tasks. To do this they may need to communicate more intelligibly and exhibit sufficient flexibility to build up their dialogues dynamically and interactively. The ability to perform intelligent dialogues is particularly crucial when we have an open system where (heterogeneous) agents ``enter and leave'' the system with little or no information about each other's capabilities. This book presents an approach towards the design of techniques enabling intelligent and flexible dialogues among agents in distributed environments. The approach draws together many ideas on speech acts, cooperation, dialogues and agent architectures, and devises a formal framework to define and specify the major components and the processes involved in reasoning about communication. Based on this framework, the book illustrates how reasoning about communication may be realised in practice. The most important practical benefit of the approach is the concept of ``cooperation protocols'' which provide a mechanism to express various methods of cooperation and structure possible patterns of dialogue in those methods. The book is useful to many disciplines concerned with intelligent systems and intelligent behaviours. In particular it is intended to benefit those interested in high-level languages and standards for interagent communication and flexible dialogues. The incentives for this work, and the literature review material provided in the introductory chapters will be useful to those starting in the field of agent systems and agent theories.},

 abstract     = {Use of mobile code can make distributed systems and the abstractions they provide more flexible to build and use. \par Richer functionality can be given to the interaction between processes by allowing code to be sent between them. More convenient, application-level operations can be made over a network. By making higher order language features transmissible, distributed components can be tightly bound together when they communicate. At the same time, familiar distributed systems can be built using mobile code. \par Mobile code can make distributed systems adaptable to application needs. Rather than fixing the interface to a resource and the pattern of interaction with it, a minimal interface can be defined and code implementing higher-level interfaces placed alongside it as and when required. These higher-level interfaces can be application-specific, allowing for interaction patterns that were unknown at the time the resource was made available. Sending code close to a resource can also reduce network usage because the point of interaction with it moves. \par The combination of document markup supporting hypertext and a language supporting state-saving allows for stateful client-server sessions with stateless servers and lightweight clients. Putting dormant mobile code in documents provides an alternative to holding knowledge of application functionality on a server machine or running arbitrary code on a client machine. \par Mobile code helps to support user mobility. Personalised environments that support state-saving can follow a user between computers. Heterogeneous state-saving allows a user's programs to be relocated between computers. By using a mobile code system with language support for state-saving, applications can direct arbitrary component migration without priming program servers with specific support. \par In summary, this dissertation supports the thesis that mobile code can be used to enhance distributed systems.},

@techreport{harker:95,
 abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the amount of information available to our society. In particular, the amount of information available on-line through vast networks like the global Internet has been growing at a staggering rate. This growth rate has by far exceeded the rate of growth in network speeds, as has the number of individuals and organizations seeking access to this information. There is thus a motivation to find abstract methods of manipulating this on-line data in ways that both serve the needs of end users efficiently and use network resources intelligently. In lieu of a traditional client-server model of information processing, which is both inflexible and potentially very inefficient, a Transportable Intelligent Agent system has the potential to achieve a more efficient and flexible network system. An intelligent agent is a program that models the information space for a user, and allows the user to specify how the information is to be processed. A transportable agent can suspend its execution, transport itself to a new location on a network, and resume execution at the new location. This is a particularly attractive model for both wireless and dialup networks where a user might not be able to maintain a permanent network connection, as well as for situations where the amount of information to be processed is large relative to the network bandwidth. Preliminary work in the field has shown that such agent systems are possible and deserve further study. This thesis describes a prototype transportable intelligent agent system that extends work already done in the field. Agents are written in a modified version of the Tcl programming language and transported using TCP/IP connections. Several simple examples demonstrate the properties of the system.},

 abstract     = {This paper introduces the idea of dynamically moving functionality in a network---between clients and servers, and between hosts at the edge of the network and nodes inside the network. At the heart of moving functionality is the ability to support mobile code---code that is not tied to any single machine, but instead can easily move from one machine to another. Mobile code has been studied mostly for application-level code. This paper explores its use for all facets of the network, and in a much more general way. Issues of efficiency, interface design, security, and resource allocation, among others, are addressed. We use the term liquid software to describe the complete picture---liquidsoftware is an entire infrastructure for dynamically moving functionality throughout a network. We expect liquid software to enble new paradigms, such as active networks that allow users and applications to customize the network by interjecting code into it.},

The characters work together to improvise a course of behavior that follows the directions, expresses their distinctive individual styles, honors social conventions, and meets other objectives. The resulting {"}performance{"} reflects the collaboration among all of the human and computer agents. Directed improvisation has several attractive properties as a paradigm for multiagent human-computer interaction, which we illustrate in our testbed application, a {"}computer-animated improvisational theater{"} for children. Directed improvisation also presents distinctive agent requirements that make it a useful addition to the domain of multiagent paradigms: demand for situated, spontaneous, opportunistic behavior; demand for very intimate agent interaction and shared control; and emphasis on process-oriented evaluation criteria.},

 abstract     = {When making a choice in the absence of decisive first-hand knowledge, choosing as other like-minded, similarly-situated people have successfully chosen in the past is a good strategy -- in effect, using other people as filters and guides: filters to strain out potentially bad choices and guides to point out potentially good choices. Current human-computer interfaces largely ignore the power of the social strategy. For most choices within an interface, new users are left to fend for themselves and if necessary, to pursue help outside of the interface. We present a general his tory-of-use method that automates a social method for informing choice and report on how it fares in the context of a fielded test case: the selection of videos from a large set. The positive results show that communal history-of-use data can serve as a powerful resource for use in interfaces.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are often described as a promising technology moving towards the vision of a widely distributed scalable electronic market. The deployment of electronic services, especially in the area of electronic commerce, raises essential questions closely related to security issues. This paper tries to address these issues by providing a taxonomy of security domains within mobile agent systems. The identified areas comprise protecting hosts against malicious agents, protecting agents from other agents, protecting hosts from other hosts, and protecting agents from malicious hosts. Whereas the first three security issues can be solved by applying traditional security mech anisms, new security techniques have to be developed to protect agents from malicious hosts. The paper analyzes possible attacks of hosts and presents, based on this analysis, an approach to prevent malicious attacks. The ap proach, which is called Code Mess Up, consists of a combination of two mechanisms: The first mechanism dy namically generates a new and far less understandable version of the agent code. The second mechanism restricts the lifetime of the agent's code and data. It is shown that the application of these two mechanism can significantly enhance the protection of agents against malicious hosts.},

 abstract     = {Active networking introduces a new flexible network service paradigm. The passive data carrier is changed to an active, dynamically configurable, data-transport-service machine, through the possibility of performing computation in the network nodes. Utilization of mobile agents allows to deliver service tasks to any place in the network. An agent can execute adaptive filtering on the bypassing data streams, do user intended signalling and handle network management tasks in a distributed manner. Looking at the aspects of network services, benefits arise from the fact that the transmission protocols can be tailored to the application by providing filtering or format conversion within the network. The 'one fits all' approach, like TCP/UDP which can just handle end-to-end loss control are strongly improved. Generally speaking there are two ways in providing active services in the network: the full user based approach, allowing the end user to distribute its own, application dependent stream forwarding agent. It can be used in the open Internet where the mobile agents can provide bridges over legacy systems. Or, the layered approach, giving only the administrator of the network the possibility to deploy new service classes within the network. This is particularly interesting in a Intranet scenario, permitting to deploy new services rapidly and granting the user only the execution of the new service. We are also concerned by service and system security and failure protection aspects of this approach: When an agent becomes mobile and it includes the possibility to reproduce child agents in any number, the problems of agent flooding become apparent. Therefore solutions have to be proposed to guarantee, that the agents which get lost or out of control, will time out and return to their home, or die immediately. A possible solution based on credits is presented and discussed. This paper reviews efforts in the research domain: including the Active IP projects at MIT, the Active Networking project at Georgia Institute of Technology and the NetScript approach from Columbia University. Our alternative approach is presented, which allows fast service deployment, examples of service usage and a service and system security concept for the proposed architecture.},

 abstract     = {We have developed a multiagent scheme which utilizes plan recognition as its primary means of acquiring the information necessary to coordinate the activities of agents. Preliminary research has demonstrated that the plan recognition system developed makes coordination of multiple agents possible. An important issue that arises when observation is the primary means of information acquisition is the introduction of uncertainty into the coordination process. We have explored the issue of early versus late commitment to the uncertain information thus gained and the resulting tradeoff between time and effort as the commitment level is changed. Our results show that while in some situations it is worthwhile delaying commitment until uncertainty is reduced, in other situations it is important to act even when uncertainty is high. The long--term goal of the research is to develop the notion of coordination through observation, where agents utilize plan recognition to acquire coordination information.},

@inproceedings{hurst97:mobile,
 abstract     = {Wireless communication with Mobile Computing devices is known to be problematic. It is very different in character from conventional communication over wired networks. Since many distributed applications make assumptions about network characteristics, they may not be used in a hostile mobile environment. \par We are proposing a new kind of messaging system which incorporates adaptive behaviour into the messages themselves. We call these 'Smart Messages', and implement them using Mobile Agents. They are transported between machines via Agent Airports. The metaphor we use is of a message being delivered by a courier (Mobile Agent), through Agent Airports, on a potentially unresolved route. The 'intelligence' is in the messages (couriers in our metaphor) themselves rather than in the network. \par The approach taken expands on the self-routing capabilities of current Mobile Agent systems such as Aglets or Telescript. We aim to provide structured support for handling the particular problems associated with wireless communications. These include very limited, variable and asymmetric bandwidth, frequent and prolonged disconnections, geographical mobility and high usage costs. We argue that this offers an efficient, adaptable and robust solution to many of the problems associated with this hostile communications environment.},

@inproceedings{Hutchinson:1995:TAS,
 abstract     = {After reviewing the critical role of speaking and listening (''verbal behavior'') in multiagent coordination and individual ''thinking'' and learning, the paper argues that the full advantages can only be achieved when verbal behavior is learned by agents. Two existing alternatives to this approach are described: programming of agent verbal behavior and training adaptive agents to comply with rules through experience with many examples. Specific advantages are listed for learning as compared with each of these alternatives. The paper describes training adaptive critic agents using methods based on Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior. Using demonstrations which will become available on the Web, the paper describes specific training procedures to teach the agent to imitate, to name objects and properties, to follow instructions, and to memorize verbal advice. Together those skills enable the agent to memorize a rule and correctly follow it the first time the agent sees the condition described in the rule. The early successes reported here, along with the huge practical advantages of the approach if it continues to be successful, encourage us to continue developing and testing agent technology based on this analysis.},

 abstract     = {We argue for an XML encoding of FIPA Agent Communication Language (ACL), and give an alpha version of it, called Agent Communication Markup Language (ACML), which we have implemented. The XML approach facilitates: (a) developing/maintaining parsers, integrating with WWW-world software engineering, and (b) the enriching capability to (hyper-)link to ontologies and other extra information. The XML approach applies similarly to KQML as well. Motivated by the importance of the content language aspect of agent communication, we focus in particular on business rules as a form of content that is important in e-commerce applications such as bidding negotiations. A leading candidate content language for business rules is Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF), which is currently in the ANSI standards committee process. We observe several major practical shortcomings of KIF as a content language for business rules in e-commerce. We argue instead for a knowledge representation (KR) approach based on Courteous Logic Programs (CLP) that overcomes several of KIF's representational limitations, and argue for this CLP approach, e.g., for its logical non-monotonicity and its computational practicality. CLP is a previous KR that expressively extends declarative ordinary logic programs cf. Prolog; it includes negation-as-failure plus prioritized conflict handling. We argue for an XML encoding of business rules content, and give an alpha version of it, called Business Rules Markup Language (BRML), which we have implemented. BRML can express both CLP and a subset of KIF (i.e., of first-order logic) that overlaps with CLP. BRML expressively both extends and complements KIF. The overall advantages of an XML approach to content language are similar to those for the XML approach to ACL, and indeed complements the latter since content is carried within ACL messages.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes the design and implementation of a unique cooperative agents testbed and tool for launching cooperative agents in an environment that addresses diverse applications for the difficult problem of seamless personal information networking (SPIN). The real-world SPIN testbed is aimed at two difficult applications, namely seamless messaging and intelligent network management. Both applications are agent-driven and share agent behaviours and the messaging agents rely on the network management device diagnostic agents for input. The paper introduces both problem areas in a common testbed. The agent launch tool is described in detail. User-centric seamless messaging assumes heterogeneous communication environments intended to support todayÌs nomadic users. The prototype is introduced for the management of messages across distributed information networks. The aim of it is to intercept, filter, interpret, and deliver multi- modal messages be they voice, fax, video and/or e-mail messages. A userÌs Personal Communication Agent is charged with delivering messages to the recipient regardless of their target messaging device be it a telephone, a pager, a desktop, a wireless laptop or a wireless phone. Personal Communication Agents classify and act on incoming messages based on their content. A Secretary Agent routes and tailors urgent messages appropriately to the Device Manager Agent which delivers the message to a device that the user may be roaming or active on. What makes the Seamless Messaging Application unique is its approach to treating a message in a universal manner, its ability to mediate between different messaging environments and devices, and its ability to try to track and find the user.},

 abstract     = {Very large networks with thousands of applications and millions of users pose serious problems to the current traditional technology. If synchronised client behaviour exists, then the limitations are even stronger. Cooperative agent systems can be a suitable technology to answer to these requirements if some aspects of the architecture are carefully designed. Particular attention should be given to the trader component and to the dynamic behaviour of the applications in response to client demand. This paper proposes a cooperative mobile agent system with a very dynamic and scalable trading service. The system is designed to allow applications to deploy servers onto the network to respond to demand making them self-configurable. Sets of simulations were performed to study the dynamic behaviour of the overall system, and identify the relevant tuning parameters.},

 abstract     = {In this paper, we present several approaches to making the process of configuring network devices easier than is currently the case. Configuring a device requires that a number of attributes in the network and on the device be set as well as certain software components be installed. For example, a printer requires that its drivers are present on workstations that will be using it. Currently, the manager of the network has to perform all required tasks manually. We describe four approaches that start with a procedure similar to the way plug-and-play components are handled by operating systems; e.g. Microsoft Windows. We extend the plug-and-play idea to network components. Next, we describe how this basic routine can be extended to a simple distributed model. A natural extension of the distributed model is the use of CORBA to handle a distributed environment. Finally, we propose a model of plug-and-play-ness based upon mobile agents and describe its implementation. We argue that the last approach has a number of advantages over the other models.},

 abstract     = {This paper illustrates a new approach to the problem of making a logical network resource configuration, adapt to customer utilisation. This is to be achieved through the use of distributed multi-agent based control techniques. The agents have goals derived from different quality metrics, which the network has to provide. In ATM networks a well designed Virtual Path Connection (VPC) overlay network tries to maximise the probability of being able to accommodate connection demand within the control plane for that particular time frame. We assume that there already exists a reasonable VPC route topology in operation. The distributed agent control architecture (Tele-MACS) describes how the coupling of planning agents with reactive agents can adapt the network resource configuration to comply with changes in user demand. The changes to the VPC route topology or capacity assignments are a requirement for the network to adapt to user behaviour and our control architecture demonstrates a mechanism for achieving the reconfigurations. The network scenario is considered a closed system, where the network operator has full control over the network elements, such as the routing tables and switching capabilities. We demonstrate our concepts with a focus on a core node ATM wide area network example, where the control system seeks to maintain network survivability and efficient use of bandwidth resources.},

 abstract     = {Two branches of the trend towards ``agents'' that are gaining currency are interface agents, software that actively assists a user in operating an interactive interface, and autonomous agents, software that takes action without user intervention and operates concurrently, either while the user is idle or taking other actions. These two branches are related, but not identical, and are often lumped together under the single term ``agent''. Much agent work can be classified as either being an interface agent, but not autonomous, or as an autonomous agent, but not operating directly in the interface. We show why it is important to have agents that are both interface agents and autonomous agents. We explore some design principles for such agents, and illustrate these principles with a description of Letizia, an autonomous interface agent that makes real-time suggestions for Web pages that a user might be interested in browsing.},

 abstract     = {The development of systems capable of handling and diagnosing malfunctions in real time has long been of considerable practical importance. This paper describes the architecture of such a system, called the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS). PRS is based on the notion of a rational agent that can reason and plan under possibly stringent constraints on both time and information. This approach provides the system with the ability to reason in complex ways about dynamic processes, while still maintaining the reactivity required to ensure appropriate responsiveness and control. By considering two large-scale applications in aerospace and telecommunications, it is shown how PRS meets many of the critical requirements for real-time malfunction-handling and diagnostic systems. Finally, PRS is compared with a number of other real-time reasoning and knowledge-based architectures that have been used in similar applications.},

@inproceedings{Ishizaki96,
 abstract     = {This research has been motivated by the lack of models and languages in the visual design field that are able to address design solutions, which continuously adapt in response to the dynamic changes both in the information itself and in the goals or intentions of the information recipient. This paper postulates a multiagent model of dynamic design -- a theoretical framework of design that provides a model with which the visual designer can think during the course of designing. The model employs a decentralized model of design as a premise, and borrows its conceptual model from the improvisational performance, such as dance and music, and bases its theoretical and technical framework on the field of multiagent systems. A design solution is considered an emergent behavior of a collection of active design agents, or performers, each of which is responsible for presenting a particular segment of information. The graphical behaviors of design agents are described by their dynamic activities -- rather than by the traditional method of fixed attributes. The model is illustrated with two design projects, Dynamic News Display System and E-Mail Reader, both of which were implemented using a multiagent design simulation system, perForm, along with an agent description language, persona.},

 abstract     = {The emergence of cooperation in a society of autonomous agents is investigated. Each agent is made to repetitively engage in a deal equivalent to the ``Prisoner's Dilemma'' game, each time changing the other party of the deal. The conditions of the deal are that the contract histories of all the agents are disclosed to the public. Several deal strategies are evaluated, and their behaviors are investigated by matching them under various conditions. Next the social evolution of deal strategies is investigated using genetic algorithm techniques. Each agent can bear a child according to the profit he gets through the deal. The child inherits the deal strategy of the parent, but the random mutation is introduced to the inheritance of strategies. It is shown that the robust and cooperative strategies emerges through the evolution starting from a simple ``Tit for Tat'' algorithms.},

In particular, we have built TACOMA Lite, a mobile code system, for this environment. With TACOMA Lite installed, hand-held computers can host and execute mobile code. TACOMA Lite has been used as platform for several mobile code applications. Through experience with these applications, we have derived a 3-layer software architecture suitable for this type of mobile computing. We conclude that, given certain constraints, mobile software can be a useful artifact in this environment.},

JADE can then be considered an agent middle-ware that implements an Agent Platform and a development framework. It deals with all those aspects that are not peculiar of the agent internals and that are independent of the applications, such as message transport, encoding and parsing, or agent life-cycle. This paper presents the JADE software describing its intended uses, as well as being a walkthrough of JADE internal architecture. The main architectural issues are discussed, and the major design decisions are outlined.},

@inproceedings{jaeger96:building,
 abstract     = {Downloading executable content, which enables principals to run programs from remote sites, is a key technology in a number of emerging applications, including collaborative systems, electronic commerce, and web information services. However, the use of downloaded executable content also presents serious security problems because it enables remote principals to execute programs on behalf of the downloading principal. Unless downloaded executable content is properly controlled, a malicious remote principal may obtain unauthorized access to the downloading principal's resources. Current solutions either attempt to strictly limit the capabilities of downloaded content or require complete trust in the remote principal, so applications which require intermediate amounts of sharing, such as collaborative applications, cannot be constructed over insecure networks. In this paper, we describe an architecture that flexibly controls the access rights of downloaded content by: (1) authenticating content sources; (2) determining content access rights based on its source and the application that it is implementing; and (3) enforcing these access rights over a wide variety of objects and for the entire computation, even if external software is used. We describe the architecture in the context of an infrastructure for supporting collaborative applications.},

 abstract     = {Agent-based computing represents an exciting new synthesis both for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more generally, Computer Science. It has the potential to significantly improve the theory and the practice of modeling, designing, and implementing computer systems. Yet, to date, there has been little systematic analysis of what makes the agent-based approach such an appealing and powerful computational model. Moreover, even less effort has been devoted to discussing the inherent disadvantages that stem from adopting an agent-oriented view. Here both sets of issues are explored. The standpoint of this analysis is the role of agent-based software in solving complex, real-world problems. In particular, it will be argued that the development of robust and scalable software systems requires autonomous agents that can complete their objectives while situated in a dynamic and uncertain environment, that can engage in rich, high-level social interactions, and that can operate within flexible organisational structures.},

 abstract     = {JKQML is a framework and API for constructing Java-based, KQML-speaking software agents that communicate over the Internet. JKQML allows the exchange of information and services between software systems, creating loosely coupled distributed systems. Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) is an agent communication language that is used in systems ranging from research experimental systems to real business production systems. Common attributes of agents include reactivity, autonomy, collaborative behavior, communication ability, mobility, and so on. Software agents must communicate with other agents in order to work flexibly and autonomously. JKQML provides flexibility for the extension of the framework, and it supports the following three protocols: KTP (KQML transfer protocol), a socket-based transport protocol for a KQML message represented in ASCII, ATP (agent transfer protocol), a protocol for KQML messages transferred by a mobile agent that is implemented by Aglets, and OTP (object transfer protocol), a transfer protocol for Java objects that are contained in a KQML message. JKQML is based on the 1996 proposal for a new KQML specification.},

 abstract     = {An ``agent'' is a process that may migrate through a computer network in order to satisfy requests made by its clients. Agents implement a computational metaphor that is analogous to how most people conduct business in their daily lives: visit a place, use a service (perhaps after some negotiation), and then move on. Thus, for the computer illiterate, agents are an attractive way to describe networka-wide computations. Agents are also useful abstractions for programmers who must implement distributed applications. This is because in the agent metaphor, the processor or ``place'' the computation is performed is not hidden from the programmer, but the communications channels are. Most current research on agents has focused on language design and application issues. The TACOMA project (Troms\o\ And COrnell Moving Agents) has, instead, focused on operating system support for agents and how agents can be used to solve problems traditionally addressed by operating systems. We have implemented prototype systems to support agents using UNIX and using Tcl/Tk on top of Horus. This paper outlines insights and questions based on that experience. We discuss abstractions needed by an operating system to support agents, and discuss some problems that arise in connection with electronic commerce involving agents.},

A relocatable dynamic object is an object with a well-defined interface that can be dynamically loaded into a client computer from a server computer (or vice versa) to reduce client-server communication requirements. Queued remote procedure call is a communication system that permits applications to continue to make non-blocking remote procedure call requests even whena host is disconnected, with requests and responses being exchanged upon network reconnection. The challenges of mobile environments include intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and channel-use optimization. Experimental results from a Rover-based mail reader, calendar program, and two non-blocking versions of World-Wide Web browsers show that Rover's services are a good match to these challenges. The Rover toolkit also offers advantages for workstation applications by providing a uniform distributed object architecture for code shipping, object caching, and asynchronous object invocation.},

An explicit goal of Emerald is support for object mobility; objects in Emerald can freely move within the system to take advantage of distribution and dynamically changing environments. We say that Emerald has {\em fine-grained} mobility because Emerald objects can be small data objects as well as process objects. Fine-grained mobility allows us to apply mobility in new ways but presents implementation problems as well. This paper discusses the benefits of fine-grained mobility, the Emerald language and run-time mechanisms that support mobility, and techniques for implementing mobility that do not degrade the performance of local operations. Performance measurements of the current implementation are included.},

A key open question is how much monitoring of other agents' states is required to be effective: The Monitoring Selectivity Problem. We investigate this question in the context of detecting failures in teams of cooperating agents, via Socially-Attentive Monitoring, which focuses on monitoring for failures in the social relationships between the agents. We empirically and analytically explore a family of socially-attentive teamwork monitoring algorithms in two dynamic, complex, multi-agent domains, under varying conditions of task distribution and uncertainty. We show that a centralized scheme using a complex algorithm trades correctness for completeness and requires monitoring all teammates. In contrast, a simple distributed teamwork monitoring algorithm results in correct and complete detection of teamwork failures, despite relying on limited, uncertain knowledge, and monitoring only key agents in a team. In addition, we report on the design of a socially-attentive monitoring system and demonstrate its generality in monitoring several coordination relationships, diagnosing detected failures, and both on-line and off-line applications.},

We built and tested an agent system that addresses the real-world problem of han-dling the activities involved in scheduling a visitor to our laboratory. The system employs both task-specific and user-centered agents, and communicates with users using both email and a graphicalinterface. This experiment has helped us to identify crucial requirements in the successful deployment of software agents, including issues of reliability, security, and ease of use. The architecture we de-veloped to meet these requirements is flexible and extensible, and is guiding our current research on principles of agent design.},

 abstract     = {HTML allows the structural markup of Web documents, distinguishing the elements of a page with tags and declaring the physical relationships among the various document elements. This organizes the display of information and allows humans to read and use it. To give machines this capability, however, requires semantic markup, identifying what each particular element means on its own (for example, 'this is a home street address' or 'this is an e-mail address'). Semantic markup would change what is now simply displayed content to machine-readable, structured content. The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) specification makes it dramatically easier to develop and deploy domain- and mission-specific Web pages. In this article, we describe the evolution of the Webs data representation from display formats to structural markup to semantic markup. The shift from structural HTML markup to semantic XML markup is a critical phase in the struggle to transform the Web from a universal information space into a knowledge network.},

We argue that the metaphors and models used in a framework will affect the thinking of the developer, and will influence the application design. Therefore, usability is of central importance for successful software development, and for reducing development and maintenance costs. We discuss the design and implementation of a lightweight agent framework for interactive multi-agent applications. A lightweight framework is advantageous for distributed interactive applications, for instance applications running on hand-held devices with limited memory. The design is based on minimalism and simplicity. We present the results from a usability study of the framework, where issues such as learnability and attitude have been evaluated. The study shows that minimalist design principles are useful for achieving understandable and navigable frameworks},

Each claims that mobile agent technologies are going to change the way we live and work, and each wants to be the company that provides the breakthrough system we all end up using. What do these agent systems actually do and, more importantly, what distinguishes one agent system from another? To help answer these questions, we downloaded three of the leading commercial systems-IBMs Aglets, General Magics Odyssey, and ObjectSpaces Voyager-and looked at issues such as ease of installation, feature set, documentation, and cost. We also discuss new capabilities of Java 1.1 that show promise as simple yet powerful means to create mobile agent systems. We conclude with a brief look at the ways in which mobile agents are currently being used and the limitations of todays technologies.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are code-containing objects that may be transmitted between communicating participants in a distributed system. As opposed to systems that only allow the exchange of nonexecutable data, systems incorporating mobile agents can achieve significant gains in performance and functionality. \par A programming language for mobile agents must be able to express their construction, transmission, receipt, and subsequent execution. Its implementation must handle architectural heterogeneity between communicating machines and provide sufficient performance for applications based on agents. In addition to these essential properties, an agent language may support desirable properties such as high-level abstractions for code manipulation and the ability to access resources on remote execution sites. \par We designed and implemented an agent programming language that satisfies the essential properties and a number of desirable ones. A key feature of our language is the use of strong static typing for remote resource access. Agents may be linked dynamically to resources on remote sites, and this linking is always guaranteed to be type safe. We provide this guarantee without requiring that all components of an agent-based system be compiled together. \par Our language also includes several features to improve the performance of mobile agents. Before an agent is transmitted, it is trimmed of values that are expected to be available on the recipient, thus shrinking transmissions. Agents may be interpreted or compiled depending on the application and the relative performance trade-offs. When compilation is used, it is done lazily: Each component of an agent is only compiled as it is needed. Furthermore, machine-specific representations for an agent can be transmitted with machine-independent ones, opening the possibility for recipients to skip compilation or interpretation altogether. \par To evaluate our language and to explore the potential of mobile agents, we developed a programming framework for agents. Several applications were implemented by other programmers within this framework using our language. Their work served to validate our design and our choice of agent language properties. We also analyzed the performance of our language on these applications and several synthetic benchmarks. The analysis shows that the features we incorporated into the implementation significantly improve performance.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are code-containing objects that may be transmitted between communicating participants in a distributed system. Compared to systems that only allow the exchange of nonexecutable data, those incorporating mobile agents can achieve significant gains in performance and functionality. \par Languages with first-class functions provide a good starting point for agent programming, as they make it easy to express the construction, transmission, receipt, and subsequent execution of agents. However, for developing real agent-based systems, a language implementation must handle architectural heterogeneity between communicating machines and provide sufficient performance for applications based on agents. In addition, agents need to be able to access resources on remote execution sites yet remain in a framework that provides sufficient security. \par In this paper we consider the uses of mobile agents and how a distributed functional language can be extended to support them. We review other agent languages and present several observations on how further work in this area may proceed.},

 abstract     = {The use of larger and more complex mobile agents in distributed applications has created a need for agent programming systems that deliver better performance. The implementation of Extended Facile, a mobile agent language, uses several strategies to boost performance. We review four main techniques: allowing agents to use different transmissible representations, optimistically transmitting machine code with agents, stripping agents of data and code that can be found at their recipients before transmitting them, and performing agent compilation lazily. Quantitative measurements show that these methods can boost absolute and relative performance.},

 abstract     = {Mobile computers have become increasingly popular as users discover the benefits of having their electronic work available at all times. However, because network conditions vary from connection to connection, using Internet resources from a mobile platform is a major challenge. Mobile agents are one solution. A mobile agent is an autonomous program that can move from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network under its own control. It can suspend its execution at any point, transport itself to a new machine, and resume execution on the new machine from the point at which it left off. On each machine, it interacts with service agents and other resources to accomplish its task, returning to its home site with a final result when that task is finished. Agent Tcl is a mobile-agent system whose agents can be written in Tcl, Java, and Scheme. Agent Tcl has extensive navigation and communication services, security mechanisms, and debugging and tracking tools. In this article we focus on Agent Tcls architecture and security mechanisms, its RPC system, and its docking system, which lets an agent move transparently among mobile computers, regardless of when they are connected to the network.},

@inproceedings{kotay:94,
 abstract     = {As network information resources grow in size, it is often most efficient to process queries and updates at the site where the data is located. This processing can be accomplished by using a traditional client-server network interface, which constrains the client to the set of queries supported by the server, or requires the server to send all data to the client for processing. The former is inflexible; the latter is inefficient. Transportable agents, which support the movement of the client computation to the location of the remote resource, have the potential to be more flexible and more efficient. Transportable agents are capable of suspending their execution, transporting themselves to another host on a network, and resuming execution from the point at which they were suspended. Transportable agents consume fewer network resources and can support systems that do not have permanent network connections, such as mobile computers and personal digital assistants. We describe a prototype transportable-agent implementation that facilitates research in this area. Agents are written in a script language that supports agent relocation, and the language is processed at each host by an agent interpreter. Electronic mail is the current transport mechanism and we plan to explore others. We present a technical-report searching agent as a demonstration of the capabilities of our prototype implementation.},

First, nontechnical users should be able to benefit from the information available on the Web without being overwhelmed by technical detail. Second, users should be freed from mundane and repetitive browsing tasks. Third, and most critical, information from the Web should be available in the format and combination that best fit the users task, regardless of the pages on which the information was originally found. This report looks at these issues for Internet automation in the context of new software agent technologies that act as user surrogates for carrying out routine Web activity.

Then, based on ideas from speech act theory, we propose a semantic description for KQML that associates ``cognitive'' states of the agent with the use of the language's primitives (performatives). We use this approach to describe the semantics for the whole set of reserved KQML performatives. Building on the semantics, we devise the conversation policies, i.e., a formal description of how KQML performatives may be combined into KQML exchanges (conversations), using a Definite Clause Grammar. Finally, we present the code for a Prolog program that shows how the conversation policies can be incorporated in a software agent that speaks KQML. The research presented here finalizes the specification of KQML and provides semantics for the language. The accompanying code shows how this research can be used to build KQML agents that make use of all of the powerful features of KQML. Thus, we offer the research community a completely defined communication language that can be used for knowledge exchange between software agents. Also, our research offers methods for: (1) a speech act theory--based semantic description of a language of communication acts, and (2) the specification of the protocols associated with these acts. Languages of communication acts address the issue of communication between software applications at a level of abstraction that could prove particularly useful to the emerging software agents paradigm of software design and developement.},

 abstract     = {We propose a new specification for the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML). KQML is a language for the communication between software agents. KQML offers a variety of message types (performatives) that express an attitude regarding the content of the exchange. Performatives can also assist agents in finding other agents that can process their requests. Our starting point for the specification of KQML is [1]. Although the differences regarding the syntax of KQML messages and the reserved performative parameters are minimal, there are significant changes regarding the set of reserved performatives, their meaning and intended use.},

@article{labrou:acls,
 abstract     = {Despite the substantial number of multi-agent systems that use an Agent Communication Language (ACL), the dust has not settled yet over the landscape of ACLs. The semantic specification issues have monopolized the debate at the expense of other important pragmatic issues that must be adequately resolved in the immediate future if ACLs are going to support the development of robust agent systems. After introducing some of the basic concepts relating to Agent Communication Languages, we cover KQML and FIPA ACL, the two existing fully-specified ACLS. We give a brief introduction to their semantics and the issues relating to semantic descriptions of ACLs. We then shift our focus beyond the semantics and point to problems and limitations shared by both ACLs. Questions such as the nature of conformance of an agent system with an ACL specification and issues such as naming, registration, authentication, basic facilitation services, etc., may or may not be (technically speaking) part of an ACL specification, but we feel that the answers and solutions to such problems can ``make or break'' an ACL. We finally discuss the future of ACL standardization efforts and identify the issues that are likely to emerge as we gain experience in building and deploying agent-based systems.},

Recently, various researchers have proposed a learning approach towards building such agents and some working prototypes have been demonstrated. Such agents learn by `watching over the shoulder' of the user and detecting patterns and regularities in the user's behavior. Despite the successes booked, a major problem with the learning approach is that the agent has to learn from scratch and thus takes some time becoming useful. Secondly, the agent's competence is necessarily limited to actions it has seen the user perform. Collaboration between agents assisting different users can alleviate both of these problems. We present a framework for multi-agent collaboration and discuss results of a working prototype, based on learning agents for electronic mail.},

 abstract     = {Joint action by a team does not consist merely of simultaneous and coordinated individual actions; to act together, a team must be aware of and care about the status of the group effort as a whole. We present a formal definition of what it could mean for a group to jointly commit to a common goal, and explore how these joint commitments relate to the individual commitments of the team members. We then consider the case of joint intention, where the goal in question involves the team performing some action. In both cases, the theory is formulated in a logical language of belief, action, and time previously used to characterize individual commitment and intention. An important consequence of the theory is the types of communication among the team members that it predicts will often be necessary.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents constitute a new approach to the architecture and implementation of distributed systems. A mobile agent is a program with a persistent identity which moves around a network and can communicate with its environment and other agents. Possible applications for mobile agents include network management, information retrieval, distributed simulation, remote device control, active documents and mobile computing. We are developing an infrastructure for the support of mobile agents which is based on a network of `agent servers'. Each of these controls the agents visiting a host, allows for status checks and intervention by the agents' owners and provides a means of communication for the agents under its control. Mobile agents can be written in a number of programming languages such as Tcl and Perl; the agent environment provides runtime support through dedicated libraries that add relocation and communication capabilities to the respective language. Our implementation is based on HTTP (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as used on the World-Wide Web; this allows us to leverage off the massive research effort which currently focuses on issues like Web security and enables convenient access to the agent environment via the Web.},

In order to complete their tasks, agents need to coordinate their actions both constantly and extensively. We present an approach that consists of a standard operating procedure and a look-ahead coordination. The standard operating procedure regulates task coupling and minimizes communication. The look-ahead coordination increases agents' global visibility and provides indicative information for decision adjustment. The goal of our approach is to prune decision myopia while maintaining system responsiveness in real-time, dynamic environments. Experimental results in job shop scheduling problems show that (1) the look-ahead coordination significantly enhances the performance of the standard operating procedure in solution quality, (2) the approach is capable of producing solutions of very high quality in a real-time environment.},

 abstract     = {The Multi-agent Environment for Constructing Cooperative Applications (MECCA) is based upon a framework unifying the internal behaviour of agents and cooperation among agents. This paper presents a formalised view of agent behaviour relying on the basic loop of goal activation, plan execution and scheduling followed by task execution. This allows for a presentation of the semantics of cooperation primitives: interagent messages supporting cooperation, comprised of speech acts operating upon objects occuring in the basic loop. The formal semantics of cooperation primitives gives a meaning to indiviudal messages, independent from the cooperation protocol. Thus, agents can reason about exchanged messages and are able to dynamically create their own methods for cooperation. Topic Areas: Agent architectures , Cooperation, coordination, and conflict.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of action selection for an autonomous agent. An agent is viewed as a collection of competence modules. Action selection is modelled as an emergent property of an activation/inhibition dynamics among these modules. A concrete action selection algorithm is presented and a detailed account of the results is given. This algorithm combines characteristics of both traditional planners and reactive systems. It provides global parameters, which one can use to tune the action selection behavior along several criteria, such as goal orientedness versus situation orientedness, bias towards ongoing plans versus adaptivity, and sensitivity to goal conflicts and `thoughtfulness' versus speed.},

 abstract     = {Orphan detection in distributed systems is a well researched field for which many solutions exist. These solutions exploit well defined parent-child relationships given in distributed systems. But they are not applicable in mobile agent systems, since no similar natural relationship between agents exist. Thus new protocols have to be developed. In this paper one such protocol for controlling mobile mobile agents and for orphan detection is presented. The `shadow' approach presented in this paper uses the idea of a placeholder (shadow) which is assigned by the agent system to each new agent. This defines an artificial relationship between agents and shadow. The shadow records the location of all dependent agents. Removing the root shadow implies that all dependent agents are declared orphan and eventually be terminated. We introduce agent proxies that create a path from shadow to every agent. In an extension of the basic protocol we additionally allow the shadow to be mobile. The shadow approach can be used for termination of groups of agents even if the exact location of each single agent is not known.},

Due to its multi-disciplinary nature, it is not surprising that proposed theories and research results in the field are not coherent and hard to integrate. In this paper we propose a functional decomposition of problem solving activities to serve as a framework to assist MAS designers in their selection and integration of different techniques and existing research results according to their system requirements. The basic phases include agent organization construction, plan generation, task allocation, plan integration, and plan execution. An example usage of the proposed model for the domain of naval radar frequency management is also presented.},

This environment is designed following the guidelines found in FIPA specifications. Therefore, it offers the management agents and services necessary to realize a FIPA-compliant open system. An agent prototype is also provided in order to ease the implementation of domain-specific agents. Even if the development environment mainly supports the C++ language, the resulting architectures are heavily based on the concept of roaming agent through a distributed environment. Interoperability with other systems, supporting other languages such as Java, is guaranteed by FIPA specifications. The presented system has been used to develop a multi-agent system that should integrate the different software modules performing sensory data interpretation, planning and faults diagnosis of a robot working in a space station.},

 abstract     = {The Internet is rapidly becoming the privileged environment for today's Multi-Agent Systems. This introduces new issues in MAS' design and development, from both a conceptual and a technological viewpoint. In particular, the dichotomy between the openness of the execution environment and the need for secure execution models makes governing agents' interaction a really complex matter, especially when mobile agents are involved. If coordination is managing the interaction, then the issue of agent coordination is strictly related with the issues of topology (how the space where agents live and possibly move is modelled and represented), authentication (how agents are identified), and authorisation (what agents are allowed to do). To this end, we first discuss the TuCSoN model for the coordination of Internet agents, then show how it can be extended to model the space where agents live and interact as a hierarchical collection of locality domains, where programmable coordination media are exploited to rule agent interaction and to support intelligent agent exploration. This makes TuCSoN result in a single coherent framework for the design and development of Internet-based MAS, which takes coordination as the basis for dealing with network topology, authentication and authorisation in a uniform way.},

 abstract     = {Behaviour based decomposition of an autonomous robot into modules such as build-maps, explore, wander, avoid objects, is more useful than the classical decomposition which is perception, modelling, planning, task execution, motor control. An algorithm is described that allows a behaviour based robot to learn on the basis of positive and nagative feedback when to activate its behaviour s. In accordance with the philosophy of the behaviour based robots the algorithm is completely distributed. Each of the behaviours independently tries to find out :- 1. whether it is relevant (i.e. whether it is all correlated to a positive feedback.) 2. what the conditions are under which it maximises the probability of receiving the positive feedback and minimises the probability of receiving a negative feedback. The algorithm was tested on a 6 legged robot which had to learn how to co-ordinate its legs to walk forward. As the number of behaviours increase, the problem of control, co-ordination becomes increasingly complex. There is a complete distribution in the algorithm and there is no central learning component and each behaviour tries to learn when it should become active. The global search space for the robot with n behaviours and m binary perceptual conditions is $n*3^m$ as every behaviour has to learn an on,off and a don't care value for every perceptual condition. Relevance and reliability of a behaviour are also defined. Research is going on to make Genghis walk backward by adding a switch that inverts the movement feedback. Study of the properties of the algorithm by building a mathematical model of it is also a proposed research. - Mali 10/93},

 abstract     = {The ``information highway'' will present us with an explosion of new computer-based tasks and services, but the complexity of this new environment will demand a new style of human-computer interaction, where the computer becomes an intelligent, active and personalized collaborator. Interface agents are computer programs that employ Artificial Intelligence techniques to provide active assistance to a user with computer-based tasks. Agents radically change the current user experience, through the metaphor that an agent can act as a personal assistant. The agent acquires its competence by learning from the user as well as from agents assisting other users. Several prototype agents have been built using this technique, including agents that provide personalized assistance with meeting scheduling, electronic mail handling, electronic news filtering and selection of entertainment.},

Within this electronic market the aspects of service customization and instant service provision are of fundamental importance. In this context a new paradigm is gaining momentum, referred to as ``Intelligent Agents''. This paper provides an overview of the emerging field of Intelligent Agents (IAs) by identifying their basic properties. Focusing on mobile agents, which could be considered as a specific class of intelligent agents, we identifiy the chances of agent technology in the context of telecommunications. Here we look at their potential impacts on open service architectures, intelligent communications and network management.},

 abstract     = {The environment of mobile computing is in many respects very different from the environment of the traditional distributed systems of today. Bandwidth, latency and delay may change dramatically when a nomadic end-user moves from one location to another or from one computing environment to another. The variety of terminal devices which nomadic users use to access Internet services also increases at a growing rate. \par Dynamic adaptation of a service to the properties of terminal equipment and available communication infrastructure is an attractive feature. With application partitioning, an application consisting of co-operating component agents can be dynamically distributed on both sides of the wireless link. By selecting a partitioning configuration based on terminal characteristics, an application can be adapted to the capabilities of the terminal. Partitioning can also be used for adapting to wireless link quality, by repartitioning the application when link quality changes sufficiently. We have designed a service for performing the partitioning decisions, and used a prototype implementation to prove that the communication delays incurred by repartitioning are acceptable.},

 abstract     = {Personal mobility features, that is the ability of a user to access his or her personalized telecommunication services at any terminal, are of great importance to answer to the challenge of providing computing and communication services anywhere and anytime in the disconnected world. Agent technology is a new and emerging software solution that can improve the design and implementation of systems supporting nomadic users. We present a framework for using mobile and intelligent agents to implement personal mobility features. Our prototype implementation clearly demonstrates advantages of agent-based solutions when compared to IN-based and to DPE-based implementations.},

 abstract     = {This chapter discusses the desirable features of languages and protocols for communication among intelligent information agents. These desiderata are divided into seven categories: form, content, semantics, implementation, networking, environment, and reliability. The Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) is a new language and protocol for exchanging information and knowledge. This work is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort, which is aimed at developing techniques and methodologies for building large--scale knowledge bases that are sharable and reusable. KQML is both a message format and a message--handling protocol to support run--time knowledge sharing among agents. KQML is described and evaluated as an agent communication language relative to the desiderata.},

The language is high-level and yet also offers a simple and smooth interface to other programming languages such as ``C''. April is oriented to the implementation of multi-agent systems. However, April is NOT a `multi-agent applications language'. It does not directly offer high level features such as: planners, problem solvers and knowledge representation systems that a multi-agent applications language might be expected to include. April is more an object based concurrent language with objects as processes. This is a highly suitable base for extension to DAI and multi-agent application platforms.},

 abstract     = {Several agent platforms of general purpose exist, e.g., Voyager and Grasshopper, each of which provide an environment for building and executing software agents. Unfortunately, the common rule is that these platforms are incompatible with each other. Thus, agents built for one platform cannot be used in another platform. In addition, they can not interact with agents in other platforms. Some effort is put into standardizing agent communication and migration in FIPA and in OMG but these standards are not yet supported by most of the existing platforms. Moreover, it is questionable whether all agent platform vendors will support these standards in the near future. Therefore, we should find some other ways to allow interaction between agents in different platforms. \par In this paper we will show that it is possible to make platform independent agents that are able to migrate between incompatible platforms, for example, between Voyager and Grasshopper. In addition, we will describe how to deliver messages to agents in other platforms so that it is transparent to the sender. We will also describe how to build platform independent service agents so that they can be used through normal method calls. Many of these ideas have already been tested successfully in our prototype implementation for Voyager and Grasshopper platforms.},

 abstract     = {This paper argues that the mobile agent approach is well suited for sporadic communication in open distributed systems - especially for rather ?loose? coope-rations across local and organizational boundaries: In an increasing number of cases, management of distributed business procedures reaches beyond such boundaries. This means for most existing workflow manage-ment systems that cooperating partners are required to give up their local autonomy. However, for cases in which business partners intend to cooper-ate but still need to preserve their local autonomy, process participation on the basis of mobile agents represents an appropriate mechanism. This article shows how such process integration can be achieved. It also demonstrates how the COSM (Common Open Service Market) system soft-ware can be extended in order to use petri-net based process definitions which realize mobile agents in an integrated distributed system platform.},

We first show how a straight-forward extension of a higher-order persistent language can be used to define activities that span multiple (semi-) autonomous nodes in heterogeneous networks. In particular, we discuss the intricate binding issues that arise in systems where threads are first-class language citizens that may access local and remote, mobile and immobile resources. \\ We also describe how our system model can be understood as a promising generalization of the more static architecture of first-order and higher-order distributed object systems. Finally, we give some insight into the implementation of persistent and migrating threads and we explain how to represent bindings to ubiquitous resources present at each node visited by a migrating thread on the network to avoid excessive communication or storage costs.},

 abstract     = {Philosophers, sociologists, psychologists, and biologists have studied the concept of benevolence for many years. Recently, researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have begun considering it, but they have chosen a definition based only on the mathematical utility for an individual agent. This definition is incomplete. As a result, many AI researchers criticize benevolence, thinking it contradicts both autonomy and rational theory. In this dissertation, I argue that benevolence should also have a classical basis that recognizes the moral goodness of an agent and includes social awareness. I describe and analyze benevolent agents in multiagent systems (MAS). First, I present a complete definition and motivations for benevolence that is appropriate for MAS. Then, I describe requirements for the structure and behavior of benevolent agents and construct a simulator, called Mattress In the Road (MIR), that can analyze and verify such requirements. Using MIR, simulations of benevolence are conducted, and the results are analyzed thoroughly. In addition, I define an appropriate world where the existence of benevolent agents can enhance the performance of the MAS. This world describes the requirements for the domain type, agents characteristics and structure, environment properties, and performance measures for the benevolent agents. Finally, I suggest some MAS applications that are driven by benevolent agents, and speculate about a more sociable Web as a result of benevolent behavior.},

@unpublished{moizumi:agent-plan,
 abstract     = {This paper considers a sequencing problem which arises naturally in the scheduling of software agents. We are given n sites at which a certain task might be successfully performed. The probability of success is $p_i$ at the ith site and these probabilities are independent. Visiting site i and trying the task there requires time (or some other cost metric) $t_i$ whether successful or not. Latencies between sites i and j are $l_{ij}$, that is, the travel time between those two sites. Should the task be successfully completed at a site then any remaining sites do not need to be visited. The {\em Travelling Agent Problem} is to find the sequence which minimizes the expected time to complete the task. The general formulation of this problem is NP-Complete. However, if the latencies are constant we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time by sorting the ratios $p_i/t_i$ according to decreasing value and visiting the sites in that order. This result then leads to an efficient algorithm when groups of sites form subnets in which latencies within a subnet are constant but can vary across subnets. We also study the case when there are deadlines for solving the problem in which case the goal is to maximize probability of success subject to satisfying the deadlines. Applications to mobile and intelligent agents are described.},

The variety of mobile workstations, handheld devices, and smart phones, which nomadic users use to access data services in the Internet, increases at growing rate. The outcome is new demands for adaptability of data services. Agent technology is one of the software solutions that may be used to fulfill the demand of ``anytime-anywhere-anyhow'' access to data services. The research project Monads addresses some of the fundamental challenges in supporting nomadic applications: adaptability to available computing and communication resources that vary in tempo-spatial space and short-term (1-30 minutes) predictions of available resources. In addition to adaptability and predictions, efficient agent communication in wireless environments is a mandatory prerequisite.},

When predictions reliable enough are available, then the negotiation between the domains can be started early enough so that authentication and admission control are already done before the need of handover. To provide seamless roaming even in the looser form between different technologies is much more challenging. In this case the applications need to adapt their behavior to the available QoS of communications resources. \par In this paper we have described how software agents can be used to provide infrastructure services so that applications have time to adjust their behavior to the forthcoming changes in QoS. Although our research is still in an early stage, the results are encouraging. Modeling user behavior and available QoS separately enables predictions of reasonable accuracy. In this approach, the models are also quite small and simple. However, a lot of research is still needed in refining various models and in combining various predictions. For small devices, the distribution of functionality between terminal devices, networks elements and application servers is an important issue.},

Recently emerging AOP plattforms claim to provide suitable technical support for the implementation of electronic market (EM) systems. EM systems allow both demanders and suppliers of services and goods in worldwide communication networks to cooperate freely based on electronic contracting and clearing services. This paper first argues that an open system infrastructure to support the ``right'' programming paradigm is a necessary but not sufficient for fostering dynamic proliferation of EM's: Another important requirement is organizational openess of clientand server cooperations. The COSM (Common Open Service Market) infrastructure aims at a system support for such applications. It was designed and implemented to realize flexible means for accessing remote services dynamically in evolving electronic markets. The paper then shows how the COSM infrastructure can be extended by AOP concepts in order to provide an adequate open systems plattform to support highly flexible service offer and access.

 abstract     = {This paper argues that the 'mobile agent' approach is well suited for sporadic communication in open distributed systems - especially for rather 'loose' cooperations across local and organizational borders: In an increasing number of cases, modern (workflow) management of distributed business procedures reaches beyond such borders. For most existing workflow management systems this means that cooperations partner are required to give their local autonomy. However, for cases in which business partners intend to cooperate but still need to preserve their local autonomy, process participation on the basis of mobile agents represents an attractive and appropriate mechanism. Based on an order processing example, the paper shows how such kind of process integration can be achieved. It then demonstrates how the COSM (Common Open Service Market) system software can be extended in order to use petri net based process definitions with realize mobile agents in an integrated distributed system plattform. Finally, basic design and implementation considarations of mobile agents in COSM are also described. Final version published in Proc. PAAM '96, London, April, the 22th-24th},

We illustrate our formalization of this basic functionality of an agent by means of examples. We also show how our model fits into the transition system semantics of concurrent reactive systems by identifying the five basic transitions of vivid agent systems: perception, reaction, planning, action, and replanning.},

 abstract     = {Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization or coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP schedules tasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction. We analyze the performance of several GPGP algorithm family members and one centralized upper bound reference algorithm, using data from simulations of multiple agent teams working in abstract task environments. We show how to decide if adding a new mechanism is useful, and suggest a way to prune the search for an appropriate combination of mechanisms in an environment.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agents are autonomous objects that can migrate from node to node of a computer network. Mobile agent technology has been proposed for various application areas, including electronic commerce, systems management and active messaging. Many of these applications - especially those for electronic commerce - require agents to be performed ``exactly once'', independent of communication and node failures. In other words, once a mobile agent has been launched, it must never be lost before its execution is finished. Moreover, each ``portion'' of the agent performed at the visited nodes is performed exactly once. Due to the autonomy of mobile agents, there is no ``natural'' instance that monitors the progress of an agent's execution. As a result of that agents may be blocked due to node crashes or network partitioning even if there are other nodes available that could continue processing. In this paper, we will describe a protocol that ensures the exactly once property of agents and additionally reduces the blocking probability of agents by introducing so-called observer nodes for monitoring the progress of agents. This protocol is based on conventional transactional technology, such as defined by X/Open DTP or CORBA OTS. It is implemented in the Mole, a mobile agent system developed at Stuttgart University.},

 abstract     = {Abstract Mobile agent technology has received a rapidly growing attention over the last few years. A number of mobile agent systems are under development in academic as well as industrial environments, there are already various moves to popularize and standardize mobile agent facilities and architectures. It has been argued that mobile agents provide certain advantages as compared to traditional approaches in terms of providing facilities like software-distribution on demand at reduced communication costs, better support for asynchronous tasks, and scalibility due to dynamic deployment which is based on a taxonomy of mobility. The employment of mobile agents has been particularly attractive in applications like information retrieval in widely distributed heterogeneous environments, network management, electronic commerce and in mobile computing. Inspite of all this growing interest and efforts the agent technology is in a fairly early stage and a number of technical problems should be solved in order to make this new technology a commercial success. These open problems include mechenisms for agent security, control structures, transactional support, and design of communication models. In this paper we extend previous research conducted on mobile agents regarding their communication performance models. It has been indicated that the optimal performance of an agent is achieved by a critical sequence of mixed remote procedure calls and agent migration. We provide here exact algorithms to solve various variants of this problem under certain restrictions on the sequence of interactions of the mobile agents.},

These solutions exploit well defined parent-child relationships given in distributed systems. But they are not applicable in mobile agent systems, since no similar natural relationship between agents exist. Thus new protocols have to be developed. In this paper one such protocol for controlling mobile mobile agents and for orphan detection is presented. The `shadow' approach presented in this paper uses the idea of a placeholder (shadow) which is assigned by the agent system to each new agent. This defines an artificial relationship between agents and shadow. The shadow records the location of all dependent agents. Removing the root shadow implies that all dependent agents are declared orphan and are eventually terminated. We introduce agent proxies that create a path from shadow to every agent. In an extension of the basic protocol we additionally allow the shadow to be mobile. The shadow approach can be used for termination of groups of agents even if the exact location of each single agent is not known.},

 abstract     = {Orphan detection and termination in distributed systems is a well researched field for which many solutions exist. These solutions exploit well defined parent-child relationships given in distributed systems. But they are not applicable in mobile agent systems, since no similar natural relationship between agents exist. Thus new protocols have to be developed. In this paper one such protocol for orphan detection and agent termination is presented. First we present two approaches, the energy concept and the path concept. The energy concept is a passive termination protocol, and the path concept is a protocol for finding agents, that can be used to implement active termination. The `energy' approach is based on the idea that an agent is provided with a limited amount of energy, which can be spent in exchange for the resources used by the agent. From time to time the agent has to request additional energy from its creator. The agent is terminated as soon as the energy falls to 0. This approach to agent termination implicitly implements orphan detection, i.e. if the creator has terminated, the dependent agents are killed as soon as they have no energy left. The `path' approach uses a chain of proxies. As soon as an agent leaves a location, a proxy is created that points to the new location. By following the chain of proxies, the path, one can find any agent, and consequently terminate it. Both approaches have disadvantages. By merging them on different levels we create a protocol that combines the advantages of both approaches, and at the same time minimizes the disadvantages. The `shadow' approach uses the idea of a placeholder (shadow) which is assigned by the agent system to each new agent. The shadow records the location of all dependent agents. Removing the root shadow implies that all dependent shadows and agents are terminated recursively. We demonstrate that the shadow approach can be used for termination of groups of agents even if the exact location of each single agent is not known. We show that shadow protocol is less fault-sensitive than the path approach and needs less communication cost than the energy approach},

The code consumer can easily and quickly validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external agents. In order to gain preliminary experience with proof-carrying code, we have performed a series of case studies. In one case study, we write safe assembly-language network packet filters. These filters can be executed with no run-time overhead, beyond a one-time cost of 1 to 3 milliseconds for validating the attached proofs. The net result is that our packet filters are formally guaranteed to be safe and are faster than packet filters created using Berkeley Packet Filters, Software Fault Isolation, or safe languages such as Modula-3. In another case study we show how proof-carrying code can be used to develop safe assembly-language extensions of the a simplified version of the TIL run-time system for Standard ML.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes a mechanism by which an operating system kernel can determine with certainty that it is safe to execute a binary supplied by an untrusted source. The kernel first defines a safety policy and makes it public. Then, using this policy, an application can provide binaries in a special form called proof-carrying code, or simply PCC. Each binary contains, in addition to the native code, a formal proof that the code obeys the safety policy. The kernel can easily validate the proof without using cryptography and without consulting any external trusted entities. If the validation succeeds, the code is guaranteed to respect the safety policy without relying on run-time checks. \par The main practical difficulty of is in generating the safety proofs. In order to gain some preliminary experience with this, we have written several network packet filters in hand-tuned DEC Alpha assembly language, and then generated binaries for them using a special prototype assembler. The binaries can be executed with no run-time overhead, beyond a one-time cost of 1 to 3 milliseconds for validating the enclosed proofs. The net result is that our packet filters are formally guaranteed to be safe and are faster than packet filters created using Berkeley Packet Filters, Software Fault Isolation, or safe languages such as Modula-3.},

 abstract     = {The massive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web caused a shift in thinking about development and distribution of software. The global sharing of information, the operation on multiple platforms in heterogeneous networks, and the lucrative signs of electronic commerce force application developers to make their applications work in a distributed client-server environment, dealing with incompatible hardware architectures and operating systems. This paper introduces Travelling Objects (TOs), a new paradigm in distributed object computing, based on an enhanced object model and built upon the platform-independent and dynamic programming language Java. Additionally, the authors provide an insight how the Travelling Object Runtime System (TORS) allows to send, receive, and interact with TOs. Finally, an easy-to-use TO Generator is introduced that produces TOs out of arbitrary Java applications.},

 abstract     = {Transportable agents are autonomous programs that migrate from machine to machine, performing complex processing at each step to satisfy client requests. As part of their duties agents often need to communicate with other agents. We propose to use remote procedure call (RPC) along with a flexible interface definition language (IDL), to add structure to inter-agent communication. The real power of our Agent RPC comes from a client-server binding mechanism based on flexible IDL matching and from support for multiple simultaneous bindings. Our agents are programmed in Agent Tcl; we describe how the Tcl implementation made RPC particularly easy to implement. Finally, although our RPC is designed for Agent Tcl programs, the concepts would also work for standard Tcl programs.},

@techreport{Nuttall94,
 abstract     = {This report details a survey of systems providing process or object migration. After an introduction to the topic a number of systems are covered in detail. Four chapters deal with systems providing migration over unmodified UNIX, those providing ``classical'' process migration and containing modified or new kernels, migration over modern microkernel based operating systems and finally those providing more general ``object'' migration. The coverage of each system contains a general overview, a detailed examination of the migration subsystem and load balancing support, if any. Migration support is sectioned into an overview, an examination of the migration mechanisms, the effects of migration on inter (task) communication, and details of any environment and associated resource transfer. The summary provides comments on the major design issues identified within the report. It notes that solutions running over raw UNIX are the least complete, and that some level of kernel modification is generally necessary in order to provide good migration support. Microkernel architectures are shown be useful to the developers of a migration subsystem due to their modularity, which tends to ease the encapsulation of process state. The ``object'' paradigm is similarly shown to aid both encapsulation and post migration communication. Finally, a note is made that very few research topics seem to remain in the construction of a process migration system since the majority of design issues have now been addressed. No one system is found to provide a complete range of features, however.},

 abstract     = {Network environments allow computer users to employ distributed information and services to complete a task. However, gathering information and using services distributed in networks requires knowing exactly what kinds of information and services are required for a task, where they are, and how they can be obtained or utilized. Tracking down the answers to these questions can be difficult, time-consuming tasks. Mobile agent technology is expected to free users from these tasks. Instead of the user searching, 'intelligent' mobile agents will comprehend the users requirements, search network nodes autonomously for appropriate information and services, and return with the answers. We developed a model based on the ability of agents to make flexible plans. The Plangent system enables mobile agents to make a plan based on user input and adopt it accordingly to information gathered from the network. In this article, we describe how we combined planning functions with mobile agent facilities, and show how the agents behave intelligently in an example application of personal travel assistance.},

 abstract     = {Safe-Tcl is a mechanism for controlling the execution of programs written in the Tcl scripting language. It allows untrusted scripts (applets) to be executed while preventing damage to the environment or leakage of private information. Safe-Tcl uses a padded cell approach: each applet is isolated in a safe interpreter where it cannot interact directly with the rest of the application. The execution environment of the safe interpreter is controlled by trusted scripts running in a master interpreter. Safe-Tcl provides an alias mechanism that allows applets to request services from the master interpreter in a controlled fashion. Safe-Tcl allows a variety of security policies to be implemented even within a single application, and it supports both policies that authenticate incoming scripts and those that do not.},

 abstract     = {This paper introduces a multi-agent system architecture to increase the value of 24 hour a day call centre service. This system supports call centres in making appointments with clients on the basis of knowledge of employees and their schedules. Relevant activities of employees are scheduled for employees in preparation of such appointments. The multi-agent system architecture is based on principled design, using the compositional development method for multi-agent systems DESIRE. To schedule procedures in which more than one employee is involved, each employee is represented by its own personal assistant agent, and a work manager agent co-ordinates the schedules of the personal assistant agents, and clients through the call centre. The multi-agent system architecture has been applied to the banking domain, in co-operation with and partially funded by the Rabobank.},

@phdthesis{Papaioannou:00,
 abstract     = {The last decade has seen an explosion in the growth and use of the Internet. Rapidly evolving network and computer technology, coupled with the exponential growth of services and information available on the Internet, is heralding in a new era of ubiquitous computing. Hundreds of millions of people will soon have pervasive access to a huge amount of information, which they will be able to access through a plethora of diverse computational devices. These devices are no longer isolated number crunching machines; rather they are on our desks, on our wrists, in our clothes, embedded in our cars, phones and even washing machines. These computers are constantly communicating with each other via LANs, Intranets, the Internet, and through wireless networks, in which the size and topology of the network is constantly changing. Over this hardware substrate we are attempting to architect new types of distributed system, ones that are able to adapt to changing qualities and location of service. Traditional theories and techniques for building distributed systems are being challenged. In this new era of massively distributed computing we require new paradigms for building distributed systems. This thesis is concerned with how we structure distributed systems. In Part I, we trace the emergence and evolution of computing abstractions and build a philosophical argument supporting mobile code, contrasting it with traditional distribution abstractions. Further, we assert the belief that the abstractions used in traditional distributed systems are flawed, and are not suited to the underlying hardware substrate on which contemporary global networks are built. In Part II, we describe the experimental work and subsequent evaluation that constitutes the first steps taken to validate the arguments of Part I.},

 abstract     = {Mobile code is being championed as a solution to a plethora of software problems. This paper investigates whether Mobile Agents and Mobile Objects support improved system integration and agility in the manufacturing domain. We describe two systems built to support the Sales Order Process of a distributed manufacturing enterprise, using IBM's Aglets Software Development Kit. The Sales Order Process model and the requirements for agility used as the basis for these implementations are derived from data collected in an industrial case study. Both systems are evaluated using the Goal/Question/Metric methodology. Two new metrics for Semantic Alignment and Change Capability are presented and used to evaluate each system with respect to the degree of system agility supported. The work described provides evidence that both Mobile Agent and Mobile Object systems have inherent properties that can be used to build agile distributed systems. Further, Mobile Agents with their additional autonomy provide marginally greater support.},

@phdthesis{partridge92:late,
 abstract     = {Computers and data networks continue to get faster. However computers and networks are geting faster in different ways. This difference is best illustrated by an example. Consider the problem of making a car faster. A 100-times improvement in speed would imply cars with cruising speeds of about 600 miles per hour. Computers are getting faster like cars get faster; they perform more instructions per second. Now imagine giving the car more storage space, while keeping its maximum speed constant. A 100-times improvement yeilds a ca that can hold 100-tomes more luggage, but stilll only goes 60 miles per hour. Networks are getting faster like larger cars, they send more bitss per packet because the speed of limit limits how fast a packet can get from one place to another. This thesis examines the implcations of this difference for the future of distributed computing. The thesis identifies four major implication: itemize The performance difference is permanent.. The speed of light is constant and there is no hope of reducing the network delay. The time spent waiting for data to cross the network will soon become the largest part of most programs' run-time. A single exchange of packets will take far more time than executing all the application's instructions. Due to their differing latencies, LANs and WANs will probably continue to exhibit different performance characteristics for some time to come. Popular distributed computing paradigms such as RPC do not appear to scale well to an environment in which network delays are long. itemize The thesis also presents a novel paradigm for distributed computation call late-binding in which applications send arbitrary pieces of code to arbitrary remote systems for evaluation. It is argued that this paradigm can give optimal performance in the number of network transits required to complete a computation. A model of distributed computation is developed and used to show that optimizing network transits will usually be the determining factor for the performance of distributed applications. Finally, it is shown that implementing late-binding is feasible.},

 abstract     = {Advancements in network technology have led to the emergence of new computing paradigms that challenge established programming practices by employing weak forms of consistency and dynamic forms of binding. Code mobility, for instance, allows for invocation-time binding between a code fragment and the location where it executes. Similarly, mobile computing allows hosts (and the software they execute) to alter their physical location. Despite apparent similarities, the two paradigms are distinct in their treatment of location and movement. This paper seeks to uncover a common foundation for the two paradigms by exploring the manner in which stereotypical forms of code mobility can be expressed in a programming notation developed for mobile computing. Several solutions to a distributed simulation problem are used to illustrate the modeling strategy for programs that employ code mobility.},

@phdthesis{Quirolgico,
 abstract     = {In many agent-based systems, neural networks are used to implement the mechanisms by which agents learn and classify patterns. In such systems, agents are typically embedded with a connectionist-based model during implementation with no means for overriding this model with new models during run-time. Thus, the way in which an agent learns or classifies patterns often remains static during the life of the agent. This problem is compounded by the lack of research in communicating subsymbolic knowledge (i.e. knowledge encoded in a neural network) between agents. As a result, an agent may be unable to adapt its learning or classification behavior to changes in its environment (especially if such changes are highly dynamic), and thus experience a degradation in performance. By allowing agents to override existing neural network models for learning or pattern classification with new models in real-time, however, they may potentially maintain or increase their performance in a dynamic environment. \par In this dissertation, we present a framework for communicating neural network knowledge between agents in order to modify an agent's learning or pattern classification behavior. This framework is comprised of a specification for modeling neural network knowledge, a protocol for communicating neural network knowledge between agents, and a specification of a multi-agent architecture for managing and using neural network knowledge among a set of distributed agents. This framework is applied to a simulated aerial reconnaissance system in order to show how the communication of neural network knowledge can help maintain the performance of agents tasked with recognizing images of mobile military objects.},

 abstract     = {The paradigm of agent based computing is becoming increasingly popular both in distributed artificial intelligence and as a general software engineering technique. The difficulty with agent based computing is that success depends not on the correctness of any one agent, but on the emergent behaviour arising from the interaction of a society of agents. As a consequence, the problem of programming agents is non trivial and poorly understood. In this paper we show that genetic programming can be used to automatically program agents which communicate and interact to solve problems. The programs evolved simulataneously define when and what to communicate, and how to use the communicated information to solve the given problem.},

@techreport{ra0:02,
 abstract     = {Reasoning about the beliefs of an agent has played an important role in Philosophy, Logic, and Artificial Intelligence. A great deal of effort has been spent on analyzing and formalizing the static aspects of belief systems. Although the dynamic aspects of belief systems, or aspects relating to how beliefs change with time, has been recognised as being important, detailed work describing the dynamic aspects of belief systems has started emerging only recently. This report examines the dynamic aspects of belief systems, also called belief revision, from a philosophical, logical, and AI perspective. It discusses two philosophical theories of belief revision, namely the coherence and foundational theories. Unlike most philosophical works which treat these as two opposing theories, we view the foundational theory as an extension of the coherence theory of belief revision. Coherence theory is based on the intuitive principles of minimal change and maximal coherence, whereas foundational theory is based on the above two principles together with the foundational thesis, which states that all beliefs are justified beliefs. By providing a possible-worlds semantics, axiomatization, and soundness and completeness results for both the theories, the report presents a detailed and formal account of belief revision that has been lacking in most earlier work in this area. This formal theory is then used to reason about actions. The resulting theory provides an elegant solution to some of the important philosophical problems in AI, namely the conceptual frame and ramification problems. It also facilitates reasoning in dynamic situations where the world changes during the execution of an action. The principles of minimal change and maximal coherence seem to unify belief revision and reasoning about actions and may form a fundamental core for reasoning about other dynamic processes that involve change.},

@techreport{rao:95b,
 abstract     = {The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour has received a great deal of attention in recent years. A number of theoretical formalizations for such multi-agent systems have been proposed. However, most of these formalizations do not have a strong semantic basis nor a sound and complete axiomatization. Hence, it has not been clear as to how these formalizations could be used in building agents in practice. This paper explores a particular type of multi-agent system, in which each agent is viewed as having the three mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D), and intention (I). It provides a family of multi-modal branching-time BDI logics with a semantics that is grounded in traditional decision theory and a possible-worlds framework, categorizes them, provides sound and complete axiomatizations, and gives constructive tableau-based decision procedures for testing the satisfiability and validity of formulas. The computational complexity of these decision procedures is no greater than the complexity of their underlying temporal logic component. The paper thus provides a basis for developing formal methods to assist in the specification, design, and verification of complex multi-agent systems.},

GroupLens is a system for collaborative filtering of netnews, to help people find articles they will like in the huge stream of available articles. News reader clients display predicted scores and make it easy for users to rate articles after they read them. Rating servers, called Better Bit Bureaus, gather and disseminate the ratings. The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction. The entire architecture is open: alternative software for news clients and Better Bit Bureaus can be developed independently and can interoperate with the components we have developed.},

 abstract     = {Mobile agent technology has been proposed for various application areas, including electronic commerce, systems management and active messaging. Many of these applications - in particular those for electronic commerce - require agents to be performed ``exactly once'', independent of communication and node failures. In other words, once a mobile agent has been launched, it must never be lost before its execution is finished. Moreover, each task of the agent performed at the visited nodes has to be performed exactly once. Due to the autonomy of mobile agents, there is no natural instance that monitors the progress of an agent's execution. As a result, agents may be blocked due to node crashes or network partitioning even if there are other nodes available that could continue processing. In this paper, we describe a protocol that provides the exactly-once property of agents and additionally reduces the blocking probability of agents by introducing observer nodes for monitoring the progress of agents. This protocol is based on conventional transactional technology, such as defined by X/Open DTP or CORBA OTS. It is being implemented in Mole, a mobile agent system developed at Stuttgart University.},

 abstract     = {Some of the most diffcult questions to answer when designing a distributed application are related to mobility: what information to transfer between sites and when and how to transfer it. Transparent distribution, the property that a program's behavior is independent of how it is partitioned among sites, does not directly address these questions. Therefore we propose to extend the language semantics with mobility control. the ability for objects to migrate between sites or to remain stationary at one site. In this way, the syntax and semantics of objects are the same regardless of whether they are used as stationary servers, mobile agents, or simply as caches. We show how to give objects an arbitrary mobility behavior that is independent of the object's definition. This gives the programmer a simple and effective control both over information transfer and over the resulting network communication patterns. These ideas have been implemented in Distributed Oz, a concurrent object-oriented language which is state-aware and has dataflow synchronization. Distributed Oz is an extension to the publicly*-available Oz 2.0 system.},

 abstract     = {In this paper we discuss a number of previously unaddressed issues that arise in automated negotiation among self-interested agents whose rationality is bounded by computational complexity. These issues are presented in the context of iterative task allocation negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such choices through conditional commitment breaking penalties is presented. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques for linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts are presented as methods for escaping local optima in the task allocation process. Implementing both methods among self-interested bounded rational agents is discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion among self-interested agents is described, and alternative remedies are presented.},

We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, improtant features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and expose various phenomena related to the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. In addition, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even deteriorate system efficiency.},

Despite its many practical benefits, mobile agent technology results in significant new security threats from malicious agents and hosts. In this paper, we propose a security architecture to achieve three goals: certification that a server has the authority to execute an agent on behalf of its sender; flexible selection of privileges, so that an agent arriving at a server may be given the privileges necessary to carry out the task for which it has come to the server; and state appraisal, to ensure that an agent has not become malicious as a consequence of alterations to its state. The architecture models the trust relations between the principals of mobile agent systems and includes authentication and authorization mechanisms.},

This problem consists in the possibility of attacks against a mobile agent by the party that maintains an agent system node, a host. The idea to solve this problem is to create a blackbox out of an original agent. A blackbox is an agent that performs the same work as the original agent, but is of a different structure. This difference allows to assume a certain agent protection time interval, during which it is impossible for an attacker to discover relevant data or to manipulate the execution of the agent. After that time interval the agent and some associated data get invalid and the agent cannot migrate or interact anymore, which prevents the exploitation of attacks after the protection interval.},

Many techniques for the first problem (a) have been developed.

Furthermore it is doubted that an agent can keep a secret (e.g., a secret key to generate digital signatures). There is an error in reasoning in the arguments supporting these beliefs which we are going to point out. In this paper we describe software-only approaches for providing computation privacy for mobile code in the important case that the mobile code fragment computes an algebraic circuit (a polynomial).

Code mobility is a flexible and powerful mechanism that can be exploited to build distributed applications in an Internet scale. At the same time, the ability to move code to and from remote hosts introduces serious security issues. These issues include authentication of the parties involved and protection of the hosts from malicious code. However, the most difficult task is to protect mobile code against attacks coming from hosts. This paper presents a mechanism based on execution tracing and cryptography that allows one to detect attacks against code, state, and execution flow of mobile software components.},

 abstract     = {Many programming languages have been developed and implemented for mobile code environments. They are typically quite expressive. But while security is an important aspect of any mobile code technology, it is often treated after the fundamental design is complete, in ad hoc ways. In the end, it is unclear what security guarantees can be made for the system. We argue that mobile programming languages should be designed around certain security properties that hold for all well-formed programs. This requires a better understanding of the relationship between programming language design and security. Appropriate security properties must be identified. Some of these properties and related issues are explored.},

 abstract     = {Computational infrastructures for cooperative work should contain embedded agents for handling many routine tasks, but as the number of agents increases and the agents become geographically and/or conceptually dispersed, supervision of the agents will become increasingly problematic. We argue that agents should be provided with deep domain knowledge that allos them to make justifiable decisions, rather than shallow models of users to mimic. In this paper, we use the application domain of distributed meeting scheduling to investigate how agents embodying deeper domain knowledge can choose among alternative strategies for searching their calendars in order to create flexible schedules within reasonable cost.},

Four different algorithms for making recommendations by using social information filtering were tested and compared. We present quantitative and qualitative results obtained from the use of Ringo by more than 2000 people.},

The layers supported a set of object oriented and database features, labeled under the name April++. April++ objects have the ability in addition to the ordinary object oriented features, to deal with dynamic methods and relational database tables as part of their state component. These high level features facilitated the design of a generic agent architecture, where several heterogeneous components can be integrated using a blackboard as communication medium. This architecture, by adding appropriate agent components, was further specialised to build agents suitable for multi-service network management. 1...},

 abstract     = {SIM\_AGENT is a toolkit that arose out of a project concerned with designing an architecture for an autonomous agent with human-like capabilities. Analysis of requirements showed a need to combine a wide variety of richly interacting mechanisms, including independent asynchronous sources of motivation and the ability to reflect on which motives to adopt, when to achieve them, how to achieve them, and so on. These internal `management' (and meta-management) processes involve a certain amount of parallelism, but resource limits imply the need for explicit control of attention. Such control problems can lead to emotional and other characteristically human affective states. In order to explore these ideas, we needed a toolkit to facilitate experiments with various architectures in various environments, including other agents. The paper outlines requirements and summarises the main design features of a Pop-11 toolkit supporting both rule-based and `sub-symbolic' mechanisms. Some experiments including hybrid architectures and genetic algorithms are summarised.},

Task distribution is affected by a negotiation process, a discussion carried on between nodes with tasks to be executed and nodes that may be able to execute those tasks. We present the specification of the protocol and demonstrate its use in the solution of a problem in distributed sensing. The utility of negotiation as an interaction mechanism is discussed. It can be used to achieve different goals, such as distributing control and data to avoid bottlenecks and enabling a finer degree of control in making resource allocation and focus decisions than is possible with traditional mechanisms.},

 abstract     = {Heterogeneous Process Migration is a technique whereby an active process is moved from one machine to another. It must then continue normal execution and communication. The source and destination processors can have a different architecture, that is, different instruction sets and data formats. Because of this heterogeneity, the entire process memory image must be translated during the migration. ``Tui'' is a prototype migration system that is able to translate the memory image of a program (written in ANSI-C) between four common architectures (m68000, SPARC, i486 and PowerPC). This requires detailed knowledge of all data types and variables used with the program. This is not always possible in non type-safe (but popular) languages such as C, Pascal and Fortran. The important features of the Tui algorithm are discussed in great detail. This includes the method by which a program's entire set of data values can be located, and eventually reconstructed on the target processor. Initial performance figures demonstrating the viability of using Tui for real migration applications are given.},

@article{Sprite3,
 abstract     = {Most migration uses initial-placement (for performance) then active migration upon eviction. Migration in Sprite almost totally invisible to users: biggest impact is change in workstation loading. In their DS, approx. 30\% of all work is done using migration, 86\% of that using initial-placement (parallel compiler, pmake). 4 important apects to design: plenty idle hosts; interactive users have exclusive right to the host they are currently using; Sprite uses kernel calls; Sprite already provides network support. Biggest problem = maintaining the state of a process - calls for encapsulation but uses lazy copy (copy-on- reference, logical copying). Centralised file servers. Problems of residual dependencies may not be left on anything other than the home-node (keep things simple). Migration decisions: what to migrate; when (initial-placement or active migration); where; who decides. Good presentation of various strategies already implemented in real systems: from 'rsh' (no policy) to choice of ``pool of processors''. Each Sprite node monitors its own loading and informs a centralised migration server if it thinks it is idle (no input for $>$ 30 seconds) (cf. Mutka \& Livny). Average time to perform an initial-placement migration was 330ms (p775). Evictions have been extremely rare. Hosts selected in order of time idle eg 17 hours, 10 hours ... rather than randomly. Great many hosts (66-78\% of them) available all of the time. Over 25 day period, over 17,000 processes requested one or more idle hosts and over 86\% got all that they wanted - only 2\% were unable to obtain any hosts. Overall system performence can be substantial (p782); much use was made of it in Sprite; cost of active migration is high compared with initial-placement. Migration now considered 'indispensible'.},

This technique, called Remote Evaluation, lets one computer send another computer a request in the form of a program. A computer that receives such a request executes the program in the request and returns the results to the sending computer. \par Remote evaluation provides a new degree of flexibility in the design of distributed systems. In present distributed systems that use Remote Procedure Calls, server computers are designed to offer a fixed set of services. In a system that uses remote evaluation, server computers are more properly viewed as programmable soft abstractions. One consequence of this flexibility is that remote evaluation can reduce the amount of communication that is required to accomplish a given task. \par Our thesis is that it is possible to design a remote evaluation system that permits the processing of a program to be distributed among remote computers without changing the program's semantics. In support of this thesis our proposal for remote evaluation uses the same argument passing semantics for local and remote procedure invocations (call by sharing); it provides atomic transactions to mask computer and communication failures; and it provides a static checking framework that identifies procedures that can not be relocated from computer to computer. \par We discuss both the semantics of remote evaluation and our experience with a prototype implementation. The idea of a remote data type is introduced to let one computer name objects at a remote computer. A detailed discussion of the compile-time and run-time support necessary for remote evaluation is provided, along with a detailed sample application.},

To enable mobility of threads running native code, we convert thread states among machine-dependent and machine-independent formats. We introduce the concept of bus stops, which are machine-independent representations of program points as represented by program counter values. The concept of bus stops can be used also for other purposes, e.g., to aid inspecting and debugging optimized code, garbage collection etc. We also discuss techniques for thread mobility among processors executing differently optimized codes. \par We demonstrate the viability of our ideas by providing a prototype implementation of object and thread mobility among heterogeneous computers. The prototype uses the Emerald distributed programming language without modification; we have merely extended the Emerald runtime system and the code generator of the Emerald compiler. Our extensions allow object and thread mobility among VAX, Sun-3, HP9000/300, and Sun SPARC workstations. The excellent intra-node performance of the original homogeneous Emerald is retained: migrated threads run at native code speed before and after migration; the same speed as on homogeneous Emerald and close to C code performance. Our implementation of mobility has not been optimized: thread mobility and trans-architecture invocations take about 60\% longer than in the homogeneous implementation. \par We believe this is the first implementation of full object and thread mobility among heterogeneous computers with threads executing native code.},

 abstract     = {As the use of Distributed Interactive Simulations has grown, the need to support a large number of players in the environment has become apparent. DIS has not been able to support a large number of entities because of its high network bandwidth requirements and the large computational loads it places on host computers. A combination of an agent based architecture and smart networks provides a promi sing solution to these problems when implementing large-scale distributed simulations. An agent system using the remote programming paradigm, transporting the necessary parameters and the necessary code for remote execution [WHITE95], could reduce the network bandwidth requirements and large computational loads associated with a large distributed simulation. This reduction would occur by eliminating unnecessary PDU traffic through the use of mobile agents that represent the originating entity. These agents would travel to, and reside on, the host computer of other entities and provide the necessary state information for stationary entities without using network resources. Smart Networks could be used to create a flexible area of interest manager, allowing entities to specify their area of interest and the information that they require from within that area [HARR95a]. This approach allows an entity to get all of the information it requires to represent its view of the simulated world while eliminating unnecessary information processing.},

 abstract     = {It is widely agreed that mobile agents in conjunction with WWW technology will provide the technical foundation for future electronic commerce. A prerequisite for the use of mobile agents in a commercial environment is, that agents have to be executed reliable, independent of communication and node failure. In this paper, we first present a recently proposed fault-tolerant protocol to ensure the exactly-once execution of an agent by monitoring the agents execution. With this protocol, agents are performed in so-called stages. Each stage consists of a number of nodes. One of these nodes executes the agent while the other nodes monitor the execution. The main focus of this paper is the construction of stages. In particular, we will investigate how the number of nodes per stage influence the probability of an agent to be blocked due to failures and which nodes should be selected when forming a stage to minimize the overhead caused by the protocol. Also a flexible itinerary concept is proposed that gives agent systems the freedom to do various kinds of optimizations when determining the next node and constructing a stage.},

A prerequisite for the use of mobile agents in these environments is that agents have to be executed reliably, independent of communication and node failures. In this article, we present two approaches improving the level of fault-tolerance in agent execution. The introduction of an itinerary concept allows to specify an agent's travel plan flexibly and provides the agent system with the possibility to postpone the visit of currently unavailable nodes or to choose alternative nodes in case of node failures. The second approach is a recently proposed fault-tolerant protocol to ensure the exactly-once execution of an agent. With this protocol, agents are performed in stages. Each stage consists of a number of nodes. One of these nodes executes the agent while the others monitor the execution. After a summary of this protocol, we focus on the construction of stages.

Two interaction models, namely the remote procedure call and the agent migration are considered. Performance models for a single interaction are introduced, which are then used to derive a performance model for a sequence of interactions. This performance model can be used to evaluate the performance of any possible behaviour of an agent in a given scenario. The application of the performance model for a typical scenario in mobile computing shows that the optimal behaviour of an agent is achieved by a mixed sequence of remote procedure calls and agent migrations. The performance model is validated by measurements of interactions of real agents in the mobile agent system Mole.},

They will enable new applications, especially those based on application-specific multicast, information fusion, and other services that leverage network-based computation and storage. Furthermore, they will accelerate the pace of innovation by decoupling network services from the underlying hardware and allowing new services to be loaded into the infrastructure on demand. \par In this paper, we describe our vision of an active network architecture, outline our approach to its design, and survey the technologies that can be brought to bear on its implementation.

To be useful to an individual user, an agent must be personalized to his or her goals, habits, and preferences. We have created an end-user programming system that makes it easy for users to state rules for their agents to follow. The main advance over previous approaches is that the system automatically determines conflicts between rules and guides users in resolving the conflicts. Thus, user and system collaborate in developing and managing a set of rules that embody the user's preferences for handling a wide variety of situations.},

Users of this information space do need tools for simple and powerful retrieval of the information they are interested in. But the existing search tools have turned out to be insufficient. They either do not scale with the large amount of available data or their results are of low quality. We present a new concept for information retrieval in the World Wide Web which satisfies both quality and efficiency. So-called domain experts acquire knowledge about specific domains. They use mobile agents to investigate the Web for documents relevant to their domain. By storing this knowledge, experts can answer future queries directly without any remote actions.},

 abstract     = {An often claimed benefit of mobile agent technology is that it reduces communication cost. But there is hardly any scenario in which this advantage has been proven or quantified on Internet scale. One important reason for this lack of quantification is that agent systems do not have global knowledge about the quality of network connections between arbitrary agent platforms and data servers. In this article, we present an approach for representing a network in a way that allows to derive approximately the quality of network connections between agent platforms and data servers. By using this representation we provide an algorithm which computes a schedule for the efficient dissemination of a mobile agent. The experimental validation of our approach shows that communication cost can be reduced by more than 50 percent in many situations.},

Specialized search tools have turned out to be much more effective and useful in certain domains. However, their ideas are often trimmed to one special domain so they cannot be applied to set up series of specialized tools. In addition, they tend to induce a tremendous load on the network. This contribution reports our approach for designing specialized search engines, so-called domain experts. These experts gather the documents relevant for their domain through mobile filter agents. We show the effectiveness of domain experts with a case study in the domain of scientific articles. Finally, we demonstrate that the filter agents' mobility can cause a significant reduction of the induced network load.},

In this report we focus on the language extensions (PASCAL-M) and the implementation aspects of the translator. The main departure in PASCAL-M from standard PASCAL is that the programmer has access to the generated code in form of string constants. An interesting aspect of the PASCAL- to (PTOM) translator is that PASCAL-M is translated to the stack-based high-level language M0. M0 is similar to PostScript and has no notion of memory addresses although PASCAL compilers usually produce code for machines or software interpreters with word addressable memory: because M0 completely hides the exact memory locations of code as well as data, we have to use other implementation approaches for activation frames, variable dereferencing and code fixups. Other aspects of the translator implementation like data mapping and heap management are also described. Finally, we relate our work to recent developments in the field of intermediate code and languages.},

 abstract     = {Implementation techniques for distributed applications can be positioned in a spectrum that ranges from data-exchange to code-exchange. Date-exchange means that the logic (i.e., code) of a distributed application is statically installed and that coordination is done by exchanging messages with predefined meanings. Code-exchange, on the other hand, means that coordination is achieved by sending around code fragments which alter the data that is bound to the network's hosts. Actual systems usually pick and combine several techniques that are positioned at different places in this spectrum. Sun's JAVA and the corresponding code-on-demand approach, for example, would be closer to the data-exchange viewpoint, while Stamos' and Gifford's Remote Evaluation is more in the line of mobile code because the initiator has more instructional capabilities. Mobile software agent systems are quite close to pure code-exchange, although they often mix-in classical data-exchange techniques (data streams between agents, or mailboxes). The aim of the mobile code environment M (m-zero) is to be as faithful as possible to the code-exchange point of view.},

 abstract     = {In recent years, many researchers as well as commercial companies have attempted to create intelligent agent-based markets or retail outlets. So far, these systems have fallen short of changing the way commerce is done over the Internet. An incomplete implementation of the market metaphor, lack of automated purchasing, and lack of agent cooperation algorithms are, in our opinion, the major reasons of this shortfall. In this research, we attempt to address these problems by designing an open marketplace architecture that includes all elements required for simulating a real market (i.e., communications, goods storage and transfer, banking, administration and policing, etc.). We also address the issues of automated purchasing and agent cooperation by devising strategies and algorithms for...},

This paper focuses on mobile agent coordination, and presents the TuCSoN coordination model for Internet applications based on mobile information agents. TuCSoN exploits a notion of local tuple-based interaction space, called a tuple centre. A tuple centre is a tuple space enhanced with the capability of programming its behaviour in response to communication events. This enables properties to be embedded into the interaction space, and a mobile agent to be designed independently of the peculiarities of the information sources. Several issues critical to Internet applications can then be charged upon tuple centres transparently to agents. The effectiveness of the TuCSoN model is first shown by means of an application example in the area of Internet information retrieval, then discussed in the context of workflow management and electronic commerce.},

In this paper, I discuss many issues involved in implementing Tcl, and describe a design for a faster system that maintains Tcl semantics, including its C callout mechanism. This design focuses on a method for caching the parsed representation for data values, and lazily converting to strings on demand. This allows most computations to be performed using native types (eg. integers) rather than strings. The current implementation is presented along with results showing a speedup of about 5-10 times over the existing Tcl interpreter.},

These agents were implemented and different populations simulated in order to learn more about their behavior and the merits of using agent models.

 abstract     = {The rapid growth of computer networks has created an opportunity for developing massively distributed computer systems. Such systems will likely consist of loose communities of heterogeneous machines running different operating systems with different security policies. The challenge is to design a reliable, and yet efficient, infrastructure trustworthy enough for electronic commerce and flexible enough to allow software upgrades as well as new functionality to propagate in a decentralized, inherently insecure, wide area network. Mobile object systems embody a paradigm where computations, i.e. running programs, may move across the network and carry out truly distributed computations. The vision is that computations structured as autonomous systems of objects will roam the network performing complex tasks on the behalf of their human owner. These mobile systems of objects carry their data as well as their code with them during their journey; thus allowing almost unlimited extendability. Such unfettered mobility raises justified security concerns. From the host's stand point first. Can an arbitrary code fragment be entrusted with local resources? To what degree is it possible to control the behaviour of downloaded code? How can secrecy and integrity be preserved? From the sender's stand point next. Is it possible to entrust the network with mobile computations that encode valuable knowledge and are empowered to carry out commercial transactions? Even though it is technically feasible to charge foreign computations for small service such as execution time or storage. The key question whether there is a way to achieve a sufficient level of security for this approach to be viable? Currently, we must answer by the negative. None of the existing mobile computation systems meet the security requirements of electronic commerce. Lack of security fosters a just say no attitude towards mobile computations in portions of the scientific and business community. The proverbial ball is now in the camp of mobile computations research. It is up to us to demonstrate that mobile objects may meet the stringent security criteria of real world applications. The main contribution of this chapter is the study of security threats inherent to communication in mobile object systems. We will study how mobile object systems communicate. Describe the dangers of traditional communication mechanisms and outline two research directions currently being investigated.},

 abstract     = {Ensuring secure information flow within programs in the context of multiple sensitivity levels has been widely studied. Especially noteworthy is Denning's work in secure flow analysis and the lattice model [6][7]. Until now, however, the soundness of Denning's analysis has not been established satisfactorily. We formulate Denning's approach as a type system and present a notion of soundness for the system that can be viewed as a form of noninterference. Soundness is established by proving, with respect to a standard programming language semantics, that all well-typed programs have this noninterference property.},

@inproceedings{wahbe93:efficient,
 abstract     = {One way to provide fault isolation among cooperating software modules is to place each in its own address space. However, for tightly-coupled modules, this solution incurs prohibitive context switch overhead. In this paper, we present a software approach to implementing fault isolation within a single address space. Our approach has two parts. First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its own fault domain, a logically separate portion of the application's address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside its fault domain. Both these software operations are portable and programming language independent. \par Our approach poses a tradeoff relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution time for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for frequently communicating modules, implementing fault isolation in software rather than hardware can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.},

@incollection{waldo97:note,
 abstract     = {Much of the current work in distributed, object-oriented systems is based on the assumption that objects form a single ontological class. This class consists of all entities that can be fully described by the specification of the set of interfaces supported by the object and the semantics of the operations in those interfaces. The class includes objects that share a single address space, objects that are in separate address spaces on the same machine, and objects that are in separate address spaces on different machines (with, perhaps, different architectures). On the view that all objects are essentially the same kind of entity, these differences in relative location are merely an aspect of the implementation of the object. Indeed, the location of an object may change over time, as an object migrates from one machine to another or the implementation of the object changes. \par It is the thesis of this note that this unified view of objects is mistaken. There are fundamental differences between the interactions of distributed objects and the interactions of non-distributed objects. Further, work in distributed object-oriented systems that is based on a model that ignores or denies these differences is doomed to failure, and could easily lead to an industry-wide rejection of the notion of distributed object-based systems.},

It focuses on mechanisms they employ to execute mobile code safely, meaning that such code is encapsulated, and interacts with its host only via a permitted interface. \par While the systems are diverse, it may be argued that each presents a different approach to safety. Java is statically type-checked during compilation and verified in bytecode form at load time. Kali-Scheme is also compiled to bytecodes, but is dynamically checked since Scheme is latently typed. Software-based fault isolation provides a lower level of encapsulation by directly inserting checks on control and data flow into the object code. \par Both software-based fault isolation and static type checking are found to be efficient. They need to address the issue of carrying checking information in the mobile code, however, while interpretation largely separates the issues of mobility and safety. Static type checking provides tighter integration of mobile code and host than sandboxing or interpretation.},

 abstract     = {This paper describes how multiple interacting swarms of adaptive mobile agents can be used to locate faults in networks. The paper proposes the use of distributed problem solving using mobile agents for fault finding in order to address the issues of client/server approaches to network management and control, such as scalability and the difficulties associated with maintaining an accurate view of the network. The paper uses a recently described architectural description for an agent that is biologically inspired and proposes chemical interaction as the principal mechanism for inter-swarm communication. Agents have behavior that is inspired by the foraging activities of ants, with each agent capable of simple actions; global knowledge is not assumed. The creation of chemical trails is proposed as the primary mechanism used in distributed problem solving arising from the self-organization of swarms of agents. Fault location is achieved as a consequence of agents moving through the network, sensing, acting upon sensed information, and subsequently modifying the chemical environment that they inhabit. Elements of a mobile code framework that is being used to support this research, and the mechanisms used for agent mobility within the network environment, are described.},

Two major models have been proposed for implementing mobile agent migration: one which captures the entire execution state of a running agent, and one which captures only object state. In this paper we compare the two models from the perspective of both the system programmer and the application programmer, in the context of Agent Java, a part of the D'Agents system developed at Dartmouth College. From the system programmer's perspective, we consider such issues as difficulty and complexity of implementation, while from the application programmer's perspective we examine the level of convenience, naturalness and functionality each method provides. Ideally, we would also like to compare the two methods in terms of performance, but time constraints and technical difficulties have prevented us from obtaining accurate results. Nevertheless, we present the results we were able to gather.},

 abstract     = {Adaptivity, both of the individual agents and of the interaction structure among the agents, seems indispensable for scaling up multi-agent systems (MAS's) in noisy environments. One important consideration in designing adaptive agents is choosing their action spaces to be as amenable as possible to machine learning techniques, especially to reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. One important way to have the interaction structure connecting agents itself be adaptive is to have the intentions and/or actions of the agents be in the input spaces of the other agents, much as in Stackelberg games. We consider both kinds of adaptivity in the design of a MAS to control network packet routing. We demonstrate on the OPNET event-driven network simulator the perhaps surprising fact that simply changing the action space of the agents to be better suited to RL can result in very large improvements in their potential performance: at their best settings, our learning-amenable router agents achieve throughputs up to five times better than that of the standard Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, even when the Bellman-Ford protocol traffic is maintained. We then demonstrate that much of that potential improvement can be realized by having the agents learn their settings when the agent interaction structure is itself adaptive.},

We present a summary of a mathematical theory for such automated configuration applicable when (as in the bar problem) the global goal can be expressed as minimizing a global energy function. We then investigate the applicability of the core concepts of that theory to a difficult variant of the bar problem. We show that a system designed in accord with that theory performs nearly optimally for the bar problem, and in particular avoids the tragedy of the commons for that problem.},

A COIN is a large multi-agent system where: \begin{itemize} \item There is little to no centralized communication or control. \item There is a provided world utility function that rates the possible histories of the full system. \end{itemize} In particular, we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The conventional approach to designing large distributed systems to optimize a world utility does not use agents running RL algorithms. Rather, that approach begins with explicit modeling of the dynamics of the overall system, followed by detailed hand-tuning of the interactions between the components to ensure that they ``cooperate'' as far as the world utility is concerned. This approach is labor-intensive, often results in highly nonrobust systems, and usually results in design techniques that have limited applicability. In contrast, we wish to solve the COIN design problem implicitly, via the ``adaptive'' character of the RL algorithms of each of the agents. This approach introduces an entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the RL algorithms are able to achieve high rewards, what reward functions for the individual agents will, when pursued by those agents, result in high world utility? In other words, what reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the tragedy of the commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap? Although still very young, research specifically concentrating on the COIN design problem has already resulted in successes in artificial domains, in particular in packet-routing, the leader-follower problem, and in variants of Arthur's El Farol bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon other disciplines related to COINs, this research will greatly expand the range of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition to drawing on them, such a fully developed science of COIN design may provide much insight into other already established scientific fields, such as economics, game theory, and population biology.},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates distorting the reward function to improve the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm. This issue is particularly important when many random variables contribute to performance, and in particular in large, heterogeneous, multi-agent systems. For tractability, we concentrate on a very simple scenario in which the utility of a ``student'' is an undiscounted sum of rewards, and each such reward is a sample of a distribution over a multi-dimensional Euclidean space, where the precise distribution sampled at time t is determined by the student's action at time t. First we derive the formula for the amount of improvement in performance possible by distorting the reward function. We show that as the number of actions the student can take is increased, using non-distorted reward functions results in the worst possible performance with probability 1. We then derive some general upper bounds on the amount of possible improvement in performance for the case where the student can only choose between two possible actions. Next we analyze a particular instance of this scenario in which the underlying distributions are Gaussian. We derive exact formulas for how much performance improvement is possible with a particular parameterized class of distortions of the reward function. We then derive a Bayesian algorithm for how a ``teacher'' should estimate from a finite set of data which of the distortions from such a class to use. We end with computer experiments verifying the gain in performance entailed by use of that algorithm, and discuss the general implications of this work for large, heterogeneous, multi-agent systems.},

 abstract     = {We consider the problem of how to design large decentralized multi-agent systems (MAS's) in an automated fashion, with little or no hand-tuning. Our approach has each agent run a reinforcement learning algorithm. This converts the problem into one of how to automatically set/update the reward functions for each of the agents so that the global goal is achieved. In particular we do not want the agents to ``work at cross-purposes'' as far as the global goal is concerned. We use the term artificial COllective INtelligence (COIN) to refer to systems that embody solutions to this problem. In this paper we present a summary of a mathematical framework for COINs. We then investigate the real-world applicability of the core concepts of that framework via two computer experiments: we show that our COINs perform near optimally in a difficult variant of Arthur's bar problem (and in particular avoid the tragedy of the commons for that problem), and we also illustrate optimal performance for our COINs in the leader-follower problem.},

Thatis, given a program which claims to semantically conform to some agent communication standard, how can we determine whether or not it does indeed conform to it? In this article, we present an expressive agent communication lan-guage, and give a semantics for this language in such a way that verifying semantic conformance becomes a realistic possibility. The techniques we develop draw upon those used to give a semantics to reactive systems in theoretical computer science. To illustrate the approach, we give an example of a simple agent system, and show that it does indeed respect the semantics},

 abstract     = {While the theoretical and experimental foundations of agent-based systems are becoming increasingly well understood, comparatively little effort has been devoted to understanding the everyday reality of carrying out an agent-based development project. As a result, agent system developers needlessly repeat the same mistakes. At best, this wastes resources; at worst, projects fail. The authors identify the main pit-falls awaiting the agent system developer and recommend ways to avoid or rectify them where possible.},
