 abstract     = {Agent's goal is represented as utility maximization. We consider two kinds of knowledge--based protocols: Bayesian and MaxMin behavior. We argue that the ground knowledge type (on which the k--b protocol is based) should be a small part of the whole knowledge. So that we present a transformation of mutual knowledge onto the ground knowledge. The ground knowledge, mutual knowledge and the transformations constitute together knowledge system. We present a simple representation of common knowledge of these systems that gives fast transformation of this knowledge onto actions. This gives rise to a re--interpretation of Agent Oriented Programming paradigm. We postulate that k--b protocol (commitment statements in AOP terms) should be rational (i.e. maximizing the utility) and fixed, whereas the subject of change should be agent's utility and knowledge. If a programmer wants a MAS to reach a goal, he should give to agents such utilities and knowledge that the joint agents' activities maximizing their utilities will lead to a desired state of MAS.},

 abstract     = {The CEC Project GOAL (Esprit 6283) aims to develop generic software tools to support a new project management paradigm, in which projects are collaborative, decentralised and inter-organizational. Our research and development activities have focussed on using multi-agent systems to address the inter-organizational aspects of interaction and communication between partners in such projects. The multi-agent framework we have been investigating and developing, called the Cooperation Services Framework (CSF), is designed to support distributed computer-supported cooperative work in inter-organizational project management. This position paper reviews our developments to date, describes our programme for realising a prototype demonstrator, and discusses some of the issues to be addressed in future investigation and experimentation. In particular, extending the CSF to include `agent brokering' between `rational agents' would enable other applications for inter-organizational interactions to be developed, such as trading systems and on-line information services.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents an agent model that makes a rational decision for balancing cost of planning and communication in a deliberation phase to adapt a dynamic world. The agent's ability for balancing these factors is very important in the multi-agents world as well as that for balancing deliberation and execution cost in the dynamic world. To realize this ability, we introduce two behavioral parameters, namely, the {\em projection level} and the {\em commitment level}. One controls how far the agent should project in his future based on his current state at the beginning of the planning. The other controls how far the agent should adhere to his plan when he detects change in the world. We show that the agent can control his time cost of planning and communication by changing these levels and, as the result of this, he can make a good plan on that occasion as well as adapt to changes in the world.},

@inproceedings{Aramkulchai:1995:GPT,
 abstract     = {Over the past few years, several different approaches have been proposed to deal with Multi-Agent Autoepistemic reasoning. Most of them have some anomalous results while the rest do not have clear and constructive proof theory. For example, Parikh [91] only allows an agent to reason nonmonotonically about other agents' knowledge but not about other agents' nonmonotonic reasoning. Morgenstern [90] provides a limited way to deal with the problem but unfortunately it is not constructive. Although Halpern [94] develops an algorithmetic definition of multiagent nonmonotonic reasoning, his approach cannot deal with default reasoning even for single-agent case. It also does not allow nested nonmonotonic reasoning of an agent about other agents' nonmonotonic reasoning. More important perhaps, these approaches seem to have unintuitive results for multi-agent case and we shall show that by considering some examples from Speech Acts. Our purpose is to find out a simple yet generalised constructive proof-theoretic framework for Multi-Agent Autoepistemic reasoning which retains the advantages of existing approaches but does not have those peculiar results. Surprisingly, the new proof-theoretic framework can be obtained by a simple modification to Parikh's approach. Furthermore, the results show that our framework is not only generalise Morgenstern's and the others approaches but also Niemela's Constructive Tightly Grounded Autoepistemic Logic.},

A technical approach is proposed for specifying and analyzing cooperation and conflict resolution protocols among distributed agents. The plan of a single agent, the communication strategy between partners and the actual moves of entities are represented whithin a single framework. The proposed technique relies on modeling agent behaviours and coordinating algorithms by labeled Predicate/Transition Petri nets. Communication primitives are introduced for negotiating shared ressources among distinct partners. In particular, the localization of agents is taken into account for allowing either rendez-vous and simultaneous data exchange, or asynchronous exchanges via message passing. A formal description of distributed agreement protocols allows the verification of general properties such as deadlock avoidance and guarantee of progress. The introduced model leads to consider conflict and cooperation as two dual operations which have to be embedded into a negotiation protocol for conflict solving. Two-partie and multi-partie negotiation protocols are described.},

We develop a model for applying Linear Prediction to a Multi-Agent environment. We design a prediction mechanism which senses its environment just by observing plain sampled data. No complex model of the environment has to be built in order to do good predictions of future events. Thus, our agents can react in a real time manner by simply analyzing the observed events. After introducing the theoretical background of Linear Prediction, we show that Linear Prediction can give good results even for multiple step predictions over a wide range of dynamics. Further, we show that, if agents apply our model competitively in a heterogeneous society of multiple agents, the stability and the performance of the whole system improves.},

This is based on cooperating intelligent entities in the sub-domains which make decisions through negotiation, using domain- specific knowledge both distributed among the entities and accessible to them. Using this architectural framework, an Agent Based Concurrent Design Environment system has been developed for feature-based design, manufacturability evaluation, and dynamic process planning. This is a multi-agent prototype system involving the following types of agent: design agent; geometric interface agent; feature agent; part agent; machine agent; tool agent; environment manager; and shop floor manager. A new technique for evaluating manufacturability is introduced, based on interacting intelligent features of the part being designed. This proof-of-concept system was developed for three-dimensional prismatic parts, with twenty-five different feature types, but can be extended to other geometries. The system has been completed and tested, and is being integrated into a larger multi-agent environment incorporating routing, scheduling, and overall production control.},

Current work in the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort has addressed the information contentlevel by the KIF language and the intentional level by the KQML langauge. In this paper we address the coordination level by means of our coordination language (COOL) that relies on speech act based communication, but integrates it in a stuctured conversation framework that captures the coordination mechanisms agents use when working together. We are currently using this language (i) to represent coordination mechanisms for the supply chain of manufacturing modeled as intelligent agents, and (ii) as an environment fo rdesigning and validating coordination protocols for multi-agent systems. This paper describes the basic elements of this language: conversation objects, conversation rules, error recovery rules, continuation rules, conversation nesting. The actual COOL source code and a running trace for the n-queens problem are presented in the Appendix.},

However, autonomous agents are increasingly used in areas related to art, entertainment, and user interface. Established fields of art and entertainment (such as film, literature, and theater) depend on believable characters more than intelligent ones. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the AI research community to study a new kind of autonomous agent, where the focus is on believability, not intelligence. I will argue that this opportunity exists, summarize the goals I see for believable agents researchs, and try to explain the key differences between believability and traditional scientific goals such as intelligence and realism. I will conclude with the suggestion that AI's founding dreams demand both intelligence and believability.},

We apply this techniques to the domain of traffic signal control whose usual strategies are modelled in a decentralized fashion. In our architecture traffic elements are modelled as single agents which have diverse knowledge represented by means of information sets. Lack of knowledge is modelled by means of games with incomplete information. Interactions among agents are both cooperative and noncooperative and are based on the rationality of the agents, which pick one of the equilibrium points of the game. Therefore the problem of equilibrium selection for noncooperative games is explored. For cooperative games the bargaining solution is used. Some examples of the traffic signal control domain which map interactions in noncooperative as well as in cooperative situations are presented.},

 abstract     = {This article delineates an agent system to solve a particular design problem - conflict-free layout of supply-air systems in buildings. The structuring of this problem leads to a space of design tasks with a default order defined by the problem domain. Any one of these tasks can be the current task of the designer and is subject to influence from a case. The case is decomposed to extract a sequence of tasks to aid the designer in solving the current task, as well as geometric and relational information about the objects which make up the case. Each of these tasks in the case is instantiated into a computational agent, with a behavioral and a domain knowledge component. The behavioral component consists of a set of generic spatial actions, organised in layers. The domain component consists of knowledge needs for the layout of supply-air pipes. A generic control system is defined both for the interaction between the behavioral and domain component of the agent, as well as interaction between groups of agents. An interactive application of the designer, information from the case and agents then drives the problem to an intended solution. A scenario is sketched to give an idea of the case adaptation system in action.},

We think that such features will become increasingly important in the account of complex, heterogeneous, adaptive, evolutionary, continuously running, open systems. We give intuitive ideas concerning the architecture of multi-agent systems where this phenomenon may occur. We propose that agents able to migrate must interpret a universal meta-language that can express in a formal way the syntax and semantics of the languages for protocol description and execution used in the target societies. We also propose that the arriving agents must have access to some minimum meta-protocols allowing them to perform minimal interactions leading to the learning of the protocols used in each society. Some implementation issues and future applications are discussed.},

We show that the COMINT model of decision making [3] enables us to approach rationalization in a rather natural fashion. Namely, it presents an automatic (as opposed to deliberative and thoughtful) way of selecting the convenient sets of knowledge structures to rationalize the agent's decisions. This automatic mechanism relies on the concepts of activation and association, both of which are central to the model of memory [2] underlying COMINT. We also give a formal definition of a rationalization basis and show how it is generated. Along the paper, we discuss some examples of personnel selection in organizations. Some aspects of the implementation of the model are also presented. Although rationalization serves a lot of purposes, this paper emphasizes its role in a multi-agent society.},

 abstract     = {Agents that operate in a multi-agent system need an efficient strategy to handle their encounters with other agents involved in that system. Searching for an optimal interactive strategy is a hard problem because it depends mostly on the behavior of the others. In this work, interaction among agents is represented as a repeated two-player game, where an agents' objective is to look for a strategy that maximizes their expected sum of rewards in the game. We assume that agents' strategies can be modeled as finite automata. A {\em model based reasoning} approach is presented as a possible method for learning an efficient interactive strategy. First, we describe how an agent should find an optimal strategy against a given model. Second, we present a heuristic algorithm that infers a model of the opponent's automata from its input/output behavior. A set of experiments that show the potential merit of the algorithm is reported as well.},

These extensions involve issues that have arisen in modeling the beliefs of other agents when dealing with inter-agent communication of incomplete and conflicting evidence, and evidence at multiple levels of abstraction. The extensions support highly directed exchanges of results among agents because they better represent the uncertainties that occur when DRESUN agents exchange incomplete and conflicting information. This is important in FA/C systems because agents must share results in order to satisfy their local goals as well as the overall system goals. Unless this sharing can be done efficiently, a distributed approach may be inappropriate.},

 abstract     = {The functionally-accurate, cooperative (FA/C) distributed problem- solving paradigm is one approach for organizing distributed problem solving among homogeneous, cooperating agents. While several FA/C systems have been implemented, there has been little formal analysis of the quality of the solutions that can be produced using the approach or of the conditions that are necessary for the approach to be effective. This paper reports on work we have done to formally analyze the FA/C model in the context of distributed sensor interpretation (SI). Several results are presented that compare the quality of solutions produced by a distributed FA/C system to those produced by an equivalent centralized system. %based on particular agent problem-solving and coordination strategies. We first establish that while it is possible for an FA/C system to produce the same solution as a centralized system, this requires the use of interpretation and coordination strategies that are impractical for most SI applications. We then consider the effect of ``approximate'' interpretation and coordination strategies.},

Some of the basic ingredients of such notions are identified and some steps are made towards their definition. In particular, it is claimed that a notion of Commitment is needed as a mediation between the individual and the collective one. Before constructing a notion of {"}Collective or Group Commitment{"} a notion of {"}Social Commitment{"} is to be defined. {"}Social commitment{"} is not an individual Commitment shared by many agents; it is the Commitment of one agent to another. The normative contents (entitlements / obligations) of this social relation are stressed and its connections with individual intentions and collective activity. On that basis, a notion of Organizational Commitment is proposed, that could account for the structure of stable Organizations. Commitment is a crucial notion both to analyse the structure of Organizations and to support cooperative work, but a deeper analysis is needed, connecting agent's mental states with social relations and structure.},

In previous works of the same authors, agents endowed with different help-seeking and help-giving attitudes have been defined and simulated in a multi-agent system, and the effect of their behavior on the global performance of the system has been measured. It has been shown that the ``social'' agents, which both give and ask for help, are the most successful, and may be able to tolerate very well the presence of exploiters. In this paper the robustness of the social strategy is tested by putting help-giving under risky conditions. The following three variables have been manipulated: number of resources available; threshold triggering the help-giving behavior; and ratio between different kinds of exploiters and social agents. The results show that, with a few exceptions, the social strategy is quite robust in several risky conditions. Some considerations about the usefulness of such a strategy for multi-agent systems are also outlined.},

 abstract     = {Software systems become more and more complex thus the application of self-developing distributed and decentralized processing is indispensable. The complexity of such systems requires new tools for designing, programming and debugging processes which implies the fact that new approaches to decentralization should be undertaken. An idea of autonomous agents arises as an extension to the object and process concepts. The active agent is invented as a basic element of which distributed and decentralized systems can be built. The use of evolution strategies in design of multi-agent systems reveals new posibilities of developing complex software systems. The evolution plays also a key role in creation and organization of social structures. In this paper a new technology of designing and building agent systems based on genetic methods and a draft concept of a model-based approach to such systems are described. Also an application of this technology to a self-developing prediction system is presented and results of simulation experiments carried out with the use of 0-1 random time series are discussed.},

 abstract     = {We take up a meeting task where agents try to gather into a single location starting from distributed arrangements. An efficient solution is one in which all agents work simultaneously, and in which the meeting location determines adaptively. However, the difficulty with this solution is that the agents, and hence the meeting location, will move unpredictably. We evaluate a dynamic solution that uses the trailblazer search as the search strategy of agents. Considering the tradeoff between reaction time and number of moves, the trailblazer search is an algorithm that dynamically maintains a map of where an agent has already searched through in the problem space (Chimura & Tokoro 94). Through a simple simulation we show the effect of agents maintaining maps, hence show that mapping functions can facilitate cooperation in meeting tasks.},

In this paper we show that a formalization using belief contexts is also elaboration tolerant. That is, it is able to cope with minor changes to input problems without major revisions. Elaboration tolerance is a vital property for building situated agents: it allows for adapting and re-using a previous problem representation in different (but related) situations, rather than building a new representation from scratch. We substantiate our claims by discussing a number of variations to a paradigmatic case study, the Three Wise Men problem.},

The language, AprilQ++, is a macro implemented extension of the distributed symbolic programming language April. The ++ signifies that it is an OO extension of April bearing the same relationship to April as C++ does to C. The `Q' indicates an additional feature. The objects in AprilQ++ can have knowledge bases comprising sets of facts and recursive definitions of relations which can be queried, both locally and remotely, using Prolog style queries. AprilQ++ has one other significant feature. Using the higher order features of the underlying April, objects can be cloned, with the current state of the object encapsulated in a procedure closure. The clone can then migrate to be forked as a new active object running on a new host. This features enables us to implement mobile agents.},

By using this language for communication, agents will be able to request and deliver services to one another. Indeed, numerous projects have shown how the language can profitably support interoperation among distributed agents. However, before becoming a widely-accepted standard, it would be worthwhile to examine the language in detail. This paper explores semantical issues raised by KQML, specifically the use of performatives for interagent communication. Numerous difficulties with the language are identified, and an attempt is made to point to their resolution. The paper illustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessary to characterize agent communication languages, and applies it to compose a question from a request and an inform. Finally, the paper discusses possible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisions from the semantical issues raised here.},

We have defined the Cassiopeia method whose specificity is to articulate the design of a multi-agent system around the notion of organization. This paper reports the use of this method for designing and implementing the organization of a soccer robot team. We show why we chose this application and how we designed it, we discuss its interest and inherent difficulties, in order to clearly express the needs for a design methodology dedicated to DAI.},

 abstract     = {The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4 (IMAP4) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. IMAP4 permits manipulation of remote message folders, called {"}mailboxes{"}, in a way that is functionally equivalent to local mailboxes. IMAP4 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server. IMAP4 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; permanently removing messages; setting and clearing flags; RFC 822 and MIME parsing; searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers (relative position from 1 to the number of messages in the mailbox) or unique identifiers (immutable, strictly ascending values assigned to each message, but which are not necessarily contiguous). IMAP4 supports a single server. A mechanism for supporting multiple IMAP4 servers is in progress. IMAP4 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP. IMAP4 is designed to be upwards compatible from the IMAP2 protocol. Compatibility issues are discussed in RFC 1732. This RFC is a product of the Internet Message Access Protocol Working Group of the IETF.},

Because of its combinatorial character, its dynamic nature and its practical interest for industrial applications, the scheduling problem has been widely studied in the literature using exact or heuristic methods. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent approach to deal with the flow shop scheduling problem. Two alternatives to optimize the scheduling are proposed and compared in terms of quality and run-time; the first one using a global simulated annealing and the second one a local simulated annealing at the level of each agent.},

 abstract     = {The Consensus Scheduling Model (CSM) is introduced as a way to accommodate negotiation in over-constrained, distributed scheduling problems. The CSM is appropriate for negotiation among a group of peers and is also applicable to a manager that must balance conflicting views of its workers. The distributed scheduling algorithm that is used selects a candidate >from the priority list of resource requests and inserts that candidate into the evolving timetable. Two protocols are required. The minimax protocol assures equitable power among the peers. The bumping protocol allows reactive scheduling by using a request's total worth to dictate when a new request can seize a previously assigned resource. A request's total worth is the sum of its priority value, its ordering value, and any bonus points received by previous negotiations. Three styles of negotiation are examined: unilateral, verbose, and periodic. Results from sample scenarios are also presented.},

 abstract     = {Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization or coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discusses the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain features in the current task environment. We show that different combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP allows more agent heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple levels of abstraction.},

In this context, learning amounts to evolving a set of good prototypical situations. With each prototypical situation an action is associated that should be executed in that situation. A set of prototypical situation/action pairs together with the nearest-neighbor rule represent the behavior of an agent. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in the light of variants of the well-known pursuit game. To this end, we present a classification of variants of the pursuit game, and we report on the results of our approach obtained for variants regarding several aspects of the classification. A first implementation of our approach that utilizes a genetic algorithm to conduct the search for a set of suitable prototypical situation/action pairs was able to handle many different variants.},

 abstract     = {We present a knowledge-based distribution concept for search problems that offer no natural way to determine several agents to cooperate in finding a solution. Systems based on our teamwork method use four types of agents: Experts and specialists use heuristics to generate results that are possible parts of solutions, referees judge the experts and their results determining the most promising ones and a supervisor collects these promising results to generate new problem descriptions that converge to a solution of the initial problem. The main difficulty of distributed systems, the communication overhead, is dealt with by restricting the work of referees and the supervisor to short moments, called team meetings, that interrupt the work of experts and specialists. The competition and cooperation of experts and specialists in this framework allow for synergetic effects that generate better and faster solutions to the search problems. We demonstrate these effects for instantiations of two very different kinds of search problems, automated theorem proving and optimization problems.},

We show how this kind of actions can be incorporated in a dynamic/ epistemic multi-agent system in which the knowledge, abilities and opportunities of agents are formalized as well as the results of actions they perform. To cope with a complexity of a rational agent behaviour, we consider scenarios composed of traditionally viewed basic actions and atomic actions with typical effects. We concentrate on a specific type of scenarios reflecting a {"}typical{"} pattern of an agent's behaviour. Adopting a model-theoretic approach we formalize a nonmonotonic preferential strategy for these scenarios in order to reason about the final results of their realization.},

 abstract     = {A set of agents (human or computer process) are supposed to decide on an action given a finite set of possible strategies when the background information is vague or numerically imprecise. The agents evaluate the strategies and communicate their opinions about their utilities, their opinions about the credibilities of the reports of the other agents, as well as their opinions of the reliabilities of the other agents. A significant property of the theory is that it admits the representation of imprecise information at all stages. The strategies are evaluated relative to generalisations of the principle of maximising the expected utility. It is also demonstrated how decision trees can be integrated into the framework and suggest an evaluation rule taking into account all strategies, credibilities, reliabilities, probabilities and utilities involved in the framework. This is done without presupposing the existence of a central co-ordinating agent that evaluates the different reports of the agents. In a distributed context there are no a priori reasons for such an agent and we show how it can be eliminated in our framework.},

To this end, we use a theory for the treatment of problems arising as a decision making agent faces a situation involving a choice between a finite set of strategies, having access to a finite set of autonomous agents reporting their opinions. The decision making agent is allowed to assign different credibility to statements of the autonomous agents. The theory admits the representation of vague and numerically imprecise information, and the evaluation results in a set of admissible strategies, by using criteria conforming to classical statistical theory. The admissible strategies can be further investigated with respect to their strengths and also with respect to the range of values consistent with the given domain that makes them admissible.},

 abstract     = {Coordination is a central theme of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one cornerstone assumption of the field is that communication is expensive relative to local computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. This paper considers how automated agents could use a coordination technique common to communication-free human interactions, namely {\em focal points}. Given a problem and a set of possible solutions from which the agents need to choose one, focal points are prominent solutions of the problem to which agents are drawn. Theoretical work on this subject includes~\cite{schelling63,kraus91a}. The purpose of the current research is to consider the practical use of focal point techniques in various domains. We present simulations over randomly generated domains; these simulations strongly suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination in real-world environments.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a general theory of action in multiagent systems which rely on a clear distinction between influences, which are produced by agents' behaviour, and the reaction of the environment. This theory allows us to rigorously describe complex interactions between situated agents. Two kind of interactions are investigated: interactions between an agent and its environment, and interactions between agents through the environment. In this respect, we will show that the second kind is a special case of the first one. Although many theories about action are based on mental issues, we rely mainly on ``what happens'' in the world, i.e. the transformations that take place during interaction. Therefore, as shown in this paper, this theory is general enough to deal with both tropistic (reactive agents) and hysteretic (agents with memory) agents as special cases of general multiagent systems.},

 abstract     = {Cooperation in multi-agent systems can be seen as a system in which cooperative methods lead to an increase of the group performance and thus augment the probability for an individual to survive. These methods give rise to conflicts due to limited resource access and lack of coordination. Specific methods such as task allocation, communication, action coordination and conflict resolution can be used to solve these problems and contribute to an expansion of the capabilities of the group. Organizations, i.e. set of structured societies of individuals, emerge from them. This talk describes many aspects of cooperation in multi-agent systems, and their connection to the process of the emergence of emerging social structures, the so-called ``emergence of collective intelligence'', with several examples taken from reactive multi-agent systems.},

 abstract     = {The MARS system is described which models cooperative scheduling within a society of shipping companies as a multiagent system. Emphasis is placed on the functionality of the system as a whole --- the solution of the global scheduling problem emerges from local decision-making and problem-solving strategies. An extension of the contract net protocol is presented; we show that it can be used to obtain good initial solutions for complex resource allocation problems. By introducing global information based upon auction protocols, this initial solution can be improved significantly. Experimental results are provided evaluating the performance of different cooperative scheduling strategies. Although the concepts for resource scheduling are presented solely for the transportation domain, their abstraction is useful for a broad variety of resource allocation problems. The MARS system solves the dynamic scheduling problem where no complete specification of the problem is available a priori; thus, it is designed as an on-line system based upon anytime algorithms.},

InteRRaP is a pragmatic approach to designing complex dynamic agent societies, e.g. for robotics and cooperative scheduling applications. It is based on three general functions describing how the actions an agent commits to are derived from its perception and from its mental model: {\em belief revision and abstraction}, {\em situation recognition and goal activation}, and {\em planning and scheduling}. It is argued that each InteRRaP control layer - the behaviour-based layer, the local planning layer, and the cooperative planning layer - can be described by a combination of different instantiations of these control functions. The basic structure of a control layer is defined. The individual functions and their implementation in the different layers are outlined.},

 abstract     = {This paper focuses on a deadline-based multiagent task decomposition/scheduling of hierarchical task structures in an environment in which one agent is responsible for assigning subtasks and their execution order to a set of agents. The overall task to be decomposed is specified in an extended version of TAEMS task modeling framework in which task quality and execution time are uncertain before execution and are represented in the form of a probability distribution. The master agent generates and assigns an initial subtask schedule to agents, and if necessary will revise agent schedules whenever agents make rescheduling requests. These requests are based on the degree of deviation that has occurred in expected quality and duration as a result of actual method execution. Evaluations of scheduler performance indicate a phase transition of rescheduling efficiency with respect to problem difficulty. Specifically, while frequent rescheduling was ineffective for both very easy and very difficult problems, it was extremely effective in the transition region (mid-range) of difficulty.},

Although we may have some intuitions about how some parameters could affect the scheduling efficiency and meeting quality, we run several experiments in order to explore the tradeoffs between different parameters. Our experiments show how the calendar and preference privacy affect the schedulling efficiency and the meeting joint quality under different experimental scenarios. The results show how the schedulling performance is more stable and constant when agents try to keep both calendar and preference privacy. We believe that these parameters play a key role in the distributed meeting scheduling task, specially if we are interested in building distributed systems with truly autonomous and independent agents where there is not a fixed centralized host agent.},

 abstract     = {Lately, defining intentions, as well as relating intentions to other components of the mental state of an agent, has been a topic of active research. However, when we look for foundations on which to base implementations of agencies, we get in real trouble because the formal side is too far from the engineering side. In this paper, we defend a model of goals and intentions, based on deductive structures, and an integrated framework for revising them, that can and has been adopted as a specification for designing and building up artificial agents. The development of our model has guided the parallel development of a workbench, and experimentation with earlier versions of the workbench has in turn provided guidance for the refinement and extension of the conceptual model. We argue that research for theoretical foundations of multiagent systems must open the way for such walks, forth towards implementations and back, in order to lead up to realistic models.},

 abstract     = {The work described in this paper aims at the definition of a general framework for the formal specification of agents' beliefs in a multiagent environment. This framework formalizes and composes two basic ideas. The first is that of {\it reasoner}, where a reasoner is an extensional representation of an agent's beliefs or of a view of an agent's beliefs. The second is that of {\it observer} i.e. of reasoner having beliefs about another reasoner. Reasoners and observers can be uniformly represented and composed in {\it belief systems} to describe complex multiagent scenarios. Belief systems are naturally presented using {\it Multi context systems}. We show how some of the modal approaches to the formalization of (non) omniscient belief can be captured within our framework.},

Significantly, fluid organizations can display long cycles of sustained cooperation interrupted by short bursts of defection.},

 abstract     = {We present a two-level model of organizational training and agent production. Managers decide whether or not to train based on both the costs of training compared to the benefits and on their expectations and observations of the number of other firms that also train. Managers also take into account the sum of their employees' contributions and the average tenure length within their organization. Employees decide whether or not to contribute to production based on their expectations as to how other employees will act. Trained workers learn over time and fold their increased productivity into their decision whether or not to contribute. We find that the dynamical behavior at the two levels is closely coupled: the evolution of the industry over time depends not only on the characteristics of training programs, learning curves, and cost-benefit analyses, but on the vagaries of chance as well. For example, in one case, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. In another, the organizational level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In this case the overall productivity stays low. We also find a correlation between high productivity and low turnover and show that a small increase in training rates can lead to explosive growth in productivity.},

 abstract     = {World-wide interlinked computer networks are forming the foundation for computational societies of software agents. Already, these new societies have encountered problems endemic to human communities, such as overusing common resources with thrashing over virtual memory and competition by packets for network time. Unlike with human societies, these inefficiencies can be overcome by re-working the algorithms governing the protocols. However, the public good problem, in which a common good is available to all regardless of contribution, can arise computationally in more subtle ways. We discuss how this can happen using Braess' Paradox and demonstrate that adding resources to a computational system can counterintuitively lower the overall performance. This is thus a case in which distributed algorithms are provably unable to achieve globally optimal performance. We illustrate our claim using a genetic algorithm and computational ecosystem.},

Recent reductions in the DoD budget have placed a premium on leveraging technologically innovative solutions to accomplish this requirement. This paper examines the integration of cooperative autonomous computational agent technology with low cost satellite communications capability. Under this concept, Intelligent Agents (IA) would be developed and integrated into the spectrum of transportation actions DoD wide. The IA would be divided into two categories, static (attached to intermodal sites) and mobile (attached to shipments). The IA act as economic competitors in routing the shipments through the DoD transportation network. The result being effective and efficient transportation of goods and personnel for both routine operations and unforeseen contingencies. The global communication system offered by the satellites would be used to track shipment status and continually update the shared intermodal knowledge base.},

Our formalism is closely related to models proposed in the area of game theory, but contains new elements that lead to a different solution concept. The advantage of our solution method is that always yields the optimal solution, which is the rational action of the agent in a multi-agent environment, given the agent's state of knowledge and its preferences, and that it works in realistic cases when agents have only a finite amount of information about the agents they interact with. Our framework can be used to investigate the rational communicative behavior. We define the concept of a pragmatic meaning of a speech act, and show how to use it to evaluate the expected utility of performing such a speech act. The expected utility can be used to choose the optimal communicative behavior.},

 abstract     = {Learning in a multiagent environment can help agents improve their performance. Agents, in meeting with others, can learn about the partner's knowledge and strategic behavior. Agents that operate in dynamic environments could react to unexpected events by generalizing what they have learned during a training stage. In this paper, we propose several learning rules for agents in a multiagent environment. Each agent acts as the teacher of its partner. The agents are trained by receiving examples from a sample space; they then go through a generalization step during which they have to apply the concept they have learned from their instructor. Agents that learn from each other can sometimes avoid repeatedly coordinating their actions from scratch for similar problems. They will sometimes be able to avoid communication at run-time, by using learned coordination concepts.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents an application of multiple-agent architecture to beat tracking for musical acoustic signals. Beat tracking is an important initial step in computer understanding of music and is useful in various multimedia applications. Most previous beat-tracking systems dealt with MIDI signals and were not based on multiple-agent architecture. Our system can recognize, in real time, temporal positions of beats in real-world audio signals that contain sounds of various instruments. Our application of multiple-agent architecture enables the system to handle ambiguous situations in interpreting real-world input signals and to examine multiple hypotheses of beat positions in parallel. Even if some agents lose track of beats, other agents will keep the correct hypothesis. These agents have been implemented on different processing elements in a parallel computer. Our experimental results show that the system is robust enough to handle audio signals sampled from commercially distributed compact discs of popular songs.},

DRLM consists of a hidden task model (HTM) used for dealing with incomplete perception, a composite state model (CSM) for interdependency between tasks, and a Q- learing subsystem (QLS) for updating action merit. In this paper, we also present a distributed Q-learning algorithm and an architecture that allows agents to reward their peers' actions and share their experience. DRLM is successfully implemented in a flexible manufactuing system where sensors (modeled as agents) have to learn to communicate with humans about the material handling activities using graphical actions such as displays and animaiton.},

Although the logical aspects of the negotiation protocol have been analyzed, the properties of protocol dynamics remain unclear. This paper introduces our quantitative analysis of protocol dynamics which is essential for constructing continuous realtime applications. In this paper, a simulation independent of any application has been carried out in order to analyze the dynamic properties of the CNP. We have obtained the following results: the contractor utility increases together with the system load while the manager utility decreases; when the number of agents increases, the contractor utility rises while the manager utility does not change; the uniformity of agents causes the concentration of ``bids'' and ``awards,'' and thus decreases the manager and the contractor utility. Furthermore, we apply our simulation results to analyze Enterprise, a famous application of the CNP, and point out the problem which might arise in Enterprise.},

 abstract     = {This article provides a specification of the reasoning processes that guide communicative actions of agents towards a potential cooperation. For this purpose we develop a formal theory with an internal perspective, which enables us to identify the key data structures and specify the relationships between them. The reasoning processes are described in terms of beliefs, desires and intentions of individual agents. The logical model of these attitudes are used to formally define a number of important states including agent to agent commitment. The reasoning processes are in essence the transitions through these states, specified by a set of rules as part of our specification language. As a result of these processes, an agent may adopt goals to communicate. These goals are fed back into the reasoning process to find appropriate communication plans that fulfill them. Our approach is therefore pragmatic since it enables a direct coupling of our theoretical concepts to an implementable model.},

 abstract     = {Rapid and increasing advances in telecommunications and distributed systems have broadened the arena of possibilites for challenging new applications such as electronic markets, distributed intelligent information services, distributed manufacturing control, cooperative multi-robot applications, and many more. These advances have enabled access to a wide variety of communication networks, offering various means for logically or geographically distributed nodes to connect and communicate. With these possibilities real challenges are converging onto problems requiring better software engineering solutions. As programs are becoming more sophisticated they may collaborate and negotiate with other programs in order to achieve their assigned tasks. To do this they may need to communicate more intelligibly and exhibit sufficient flexibility to build up their dialogues dynamically and interactively. The ability to perform intelligent dialogues is particularly crucial when we have an open system where (heterogeneous) agents ``enter and leave'' the system with little or no information about each other's capabilities. This book presents an approach towards the design of techniques enabling intelligent and flexible dialogues among agents in distributed environments. The approach draws together many ideas on speech acts, cooperation, dialogues and agent architectures, and devises a formal framework to define and specify the major components and the processes involved in reasoning about communication. Based on this framework, the book illustrates how reasoning about communication may be realised in practice. The most important practical benefit of the approach is the concept of ``cooperation protocols'' which provide a mechanism to express various methods of cooperation and structure possible patterns of dialogue in those methods. The book is useful to many disciplines concerned with intelligent systems and intelligent behaviours. In particular it is intended to benefit those interested in high-level languages and standards for interagent communication and flexible dialogues. The incentives for this work, and the literature review material provided in the introductory chapters will be useful to those starting in the field of agent systems and agent theories.},

 abstract     = {Communication inherently tends to be cooperative. Not only the sender of a message intends to communicate, but also the receiver is normally motivated to know the semantic content of the message intended by the sender, even if the receiver doubts the sender's honesty. The present paper accounts for how autonomous agents as selfish utility maximizers naturally cooperate in reaching a common optimal mapping between messages and their contents, raising the robustness of communication. An occasion of communication between two agents can be generally formalized as a non-cooperative n-person game (usually n>2), and the optimal mapping is shown to be obtained as a Nash equilibrium which maximizes the agents' expected utility over all the possible occasions of communication. Some regularities in natural language pragmatics are demonstrated to follow from this account.},

The Simulator determines the raw fitness of each agent by interpreting the associated program. General programs are evolved to solve this problem. Different environmental setups are presented to show the generality of the solution. These environments include one agent in a fixed environment, one agent in a fluctuating environment, and multiple agents in a fluctuating environment cooperating together. The genetic programming technique was extremely successful. The average fitness per generation in all three environments tested showed steady improvement. Programs were successfully generated that enabled an agent to handle any possible environment.},

 abstract     = {A key concern in genetic programming (GP) is the size of the state-space which must be searched for large and complex problem domains. One method to reduce the state-space size is by using Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP). We applied both GP and STGP to construct cooperation strategies to be used by multiple predator agents to pursue and capture a prey agent on a grid-world. This domain has been extensively studied in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) as an easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve cooperation problem. The evolved programs from our systems are competitive with manually derived greedy algorithms. In particular the STGP paradigm evolved strategies in which the predators were able to achieve their goal without explicitly sensing the location of other predators or communicating with other predators. This is an improvement over previous research in this area. The results of our experiments indicate that STGP is able to evolve programs that perform significantly better than GP evolved programs. In addition, the programs generated by STGP were easier to understand.},

 abstract     = {In order to effectively exploit opportunities presented in the environment agents in a group must be well-adapted to each other and to the environment. Agents that fail to adapt and modify their behavior to suit environmental demands can hinder, rather than aid, in achieving group goals. Adaptability and flexibility are key components of intelligent behavior which allow agent groups to improve performance in a given domain using prior problem solving experience. This paper focuses on a particular incremental learning mechanism by which agents can better adapt to each other using problem solving experience. In particular, we propose a framework in which individual group members learn cases to improve their model of other group members. Using these models agents can choose less greedy and more appropriate actions in the context of the group. We use a testbed problem from the distributed AI literature to show that simultaneous learning by group members can lead to significant improvement in group performance and efficiency over agent groups following static behavioral rules.},

 abstract     = {The predator/prey domain is utilized to conduct research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Genetic Programing is used to evolve behavioral strategies for the predator agents. To further the utility of the predator strategies, the prey population is allowed to evolve at the same time. The expected competitive learning cycle did not surface. This failing is investigated, and a simple prey algorithm surfaces, which is consistently able to evade capture from the predator algorithms.},

 abstract     = {Specification refinement is part of formal program derivation, a method by which software is directly constructed from a provably correct specification. Because program derivation is an intensive manual exercise used for critical software systems, an automated approach would allow it to be viable for many other types of software systems. The goal of this research is to determine if genetic programming (GP) can be used to automate the specification refinement process. The initial steps toward this goal are to show that a well--known proof logic for program derivation can be encoded such that a GP--based system can infer sentences in the logic for proof of a particular sentence. The results are promising and indicate that GP can be useful in aiding program derivation.},

For example, an user might prefer not to meet at lunchtime unless the president of the company is hosting the meeting. We apply techniques from voting theory to arrive at consensus choices for meeting times while balancing different preferences.},

 abstract     = {Complex group behavior arises in social insects colonies as the integration of the actions of simple and redundant individual insects [Adler and Gordon, 1992, Oster and Wilson, 1978]. Furthermore, the colony can act as an information center to expedite foraging [Brown, 1989]. We apply these lessons from natural systems to model collective action and memory in a computational agent society. Collective action has been examined to expedite search in optimization problems [Dorigo {\em et al.}, 1996]. Collective memory has been applied to learning in multiagent systems [Garland and Alterman, 1996]. We integrate the simplicity of collective action with the pattern detection of collective memory to significantly improve both the gathering and processing of knowledge. We investigate the augmentation of distributed search in genetic programming based systems with collective memory. Four models of collective memory search are defined based on the interaction of the search agents and the process agents which manipulate the collective memory. We present implementations of the collective memory search models and further show how collective memory search facilitates ``scaling up'' a problem domain. An Active-Passive model, which gathers results from the independent searchers, is examined and found to provide a springboard from which search agents can extend their exploration. A Passive-Active model, in which the gathered results are collated, is employed by the process agents to piece together the solution from the parts collected by the search agents. An Active-Active model, in which the gathered results are collated and returned back to the search agents, allows the search agents to effectively explore the search space while the process agents concurrently search and manipulate the much smaller collective memory space.},

 abstract     = {When multiple agents solve their own problems while they interact with each other, it is helpful to form a coalition, which is a group of agents working together. Previous approach to coalition formation suggests to define the utility of coalitions and to use a strategy that agents form coalitions for getting higher utility. However, in some problems, the utility of coalitions is not easily obtainable because it might depend on uncertainty of other agents' problem solving. We describe a model of coalition formation where agents form coalitions for breaking deadlocks. In this model, agents solve distributed constraint satisfaction problem with an iterative repair method and form coalitions when they get stuck at local minima. This model is suggested to realize new approach to coalition formation. We also present experimental results on problem solving strategies in coalitions: the selfish and the altruistic.},

 abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the concept of multiagent systems as applied to high-speed network traffic control. In the high-speed domain, the propagation delay in a network causes significant problems. One of them is that any centralized control is too late to maintain normal network operations, so distributed traffic control by autonomous agents is required. The basic idea of our traffic control for high-speed networks is a combination of distributed local control and centralized global control; that is, before the global control becomes effective, all network nodes try to maintain their operations in cooperation with other nodes. The significance of propagation delay in such networks requires that the communication delay is included in the model of the node agents. This paper proposes a multiagent traffic control and illustrates the experimental results. The results show that the control based on the multiagent system can improve the efficiency of network control.},

Moreover, other agents' actions are often not directly observable, and the actions taken by the learning agent can strongly bias which range of behaviors are encountered. We define the concept of a self-fulfilling equilibrium, where all agents' expectations are realized, and each agent responds optimally to its expectations. We present a generic multiagent exchange situation, in which the competitive equilibrium is self-fulfilling. We then introduce an agent that executes a more sophisticated strategic learning strategy, building a model of the response of other agents. We found that the system reliably converges to a self-fulfilling equilibrium, but that depending on its initial belief, the strategic learning agent may be better or worse off than had it not attempted to learn a model of the other agents at all.},

Preliminary research has demonstrated that the plan recognition system developed makes coordination of multiple agents possible. An important issue that arises when observation is the primary means of information acquisition is the introduction of uncertainty into the coordination process. We have explored the issue of early versus late commitment to the uncertain information thus gained and the resulting tradeoff between time and effort as the commitment level is changed. Our results show that while in some situations it is worthwhile delaying commitment until uncertainty is reduced, in other situations it is important to act even when uncertainty is high. The long--term goal of the research is to develop the notion of coordination through observation, where agents utilize plan recognition to acquire coordination information.},

Agents in our research are supplied plan recognition capabilities in the form of specially instantiated belief networks. These networks, called Plan Recognition Networks (PRSn), are automatically constructed from plan models by the ASPRN system. Our initial experiments demonstrate that plan recognition can provide effective coordination, both for cooperating with team agents as well as for competing against non-team agents. We have also begun to explore the factors involved with PRN-based coordination relative to communication-based coordination and we describe results of some early experiments.},

The auctioneer sees to it that no agent buys resources for more than its bid and no agent sells resources for less than its bid. The market system has been implemented and runs on a regular basis as part of a building energy management system. Results show that the thermal auction leads to an equitable temperature distribution throughout the area under its control without incurring any extra costs such as excessive actuator movement.},

 abstract     = {The key factor that will determine the speed and depth to which multi-agent systems penetrate the commercial marketplace is the ease with which applications can be developed. One approach is to use general purpose languages to construct layers of agent level constructs. Object-oriented languages have been advocated as suitable for tackling the complexity of distributed systems. According to Gasser and Briot [1992], the key problem with the common forms of object based concurrent programming is the fixed boundaries they give to agents are too inflexible. They do not reflect either the theoretical positions emerging in DAI or the reality of multilevel aggregations of actions and knowledge. This paper advocates the use of a rather different type of object based concurrent language, stream logic programming (SLP) that does not have this drawback.},

 abstract     = {This paper investigates real-time bidirectional search (RTBS) algorithms, where two problem solving agents, starting from the initial and goal states, physically move toward each other. To evaluate the RTBS performance, two kinds of algorithms are proposed and are compared to real-time unidirectional search (RTUS). One is called centralized RTBS where a supervisor always selects the best action from all possible moves of the two problem solvers. The other is called decoupled RTBS where no supervisor exists and the two problem solvers independently select their next moves. Experiments on mazes and n-puzzles show that (1) in clear situations decoupled RTBS performs better, while in uncertain situations, centralized RTBS becomes more efficient, and that (2) RTBS is more efficient than RTUS for 15- and 24-puzzles but not for randomly generated mazes. It will be shown that the selection of the multi-agent organization is the selection of the problem space, which determines the baseline of the organizational efficiency; once a hard problem space is selected, the local coordination among problem solvers cannot overcome the deficit.},

To increase office productivity with computer software, both personal and group work should be supported. However, the currently available office work support software, such as groupware or a software secretary, focuses on either of these activities. In this paper, a multiagent-based office work support system and its architecture are introduced. In this system, there exist agents for group and personal work, and they are mutually connected in a two-layered agent network. With the support of these agents, people in an office can expect to efficiently perform both their group and personal work.},

However, reasoning about belief is very difficult because various factors affect belief and they often lead to inconsistency. This paper presents a simple algorithm to calculate multiagent nested belief >from an action sequence. The following three factors are essential in this algorithm: 1) the observability conditions of fluents and actions, 2) the direct\slash indirect effects of each action, and 3) the incompatibility of fluents. The algorithm performs backward reasoning from a query, and is implemented in Prolog. It has been tested by dozens of examples through a graphic interface. Experiments show the system gives plausible answers to various queries. This method will be useful in the construction of plan recognition systems and other advanced systems.},

Each agent is made to repetitively engage in a deal equivalent to the ``Prisoner's Dilemma'' game, each time changing the other party of the deal. The conditions of the deal are that the contract histories of all the agents are disclosed to the public. Several deal strategies are evaluated, and their behaviors are investigated by matching them under various conditions. Next the social evolution of deal strategies is investigated using genetic algorithm techniques. Each agent can bear a child according to the profit he gets through the deal. The child inherits the deal strategy of the parent, but the random mutation is introduced to the inheritance of strategies. It is shown that the robust and cooperative strategies emerges through the evolution starting from a simple ``Tit for Tat'' algorithms.},

Cooperative Distributed ES (CDES) is a framework which can unify multiple expertise to develop a large scaled ES. In CDES, ESs which are under building through acquiring knowledge from human experts as agents and task structure is learned by cooperation among agents based on extented Contract Net. At first, fundamental structure of CDES is provided. An experiment is made to evaluate the algorithm of Bid analyzer on the testbed of CDES. Then, self-reorganizational schemes are provided by changing agent's scope of domain knowledge, that is granularity, by themselves from two viewpoints of decomposing into fine grain and composing into coarse grain. Two experiments are made to learn subtask structure to change weight of cooperation among agents dynamically. Finally, we discuss the scheme which incorporate decomposition and composition of agents.},

 abstract     = {Multiagent systems in which agents interact with each other are now being proposed as a solution to many problems which can be grouped together under the ``distributed problem solving'' umbrella. For such systems to work properly, it is necessary that agents learn from their environment and adapt their behaviour accordingly. In this paper we present a system which uses a combination of neuro--fuzzy learning and static adaptation to coordinate the activity of multiple agents. An epistemic utility based formulation is used to automatically generate the exemplars for learning, making the process unsupervised. The system has been developed in the context of a scientific computing scenario.},

We describe a plan synchronization method for goals expressed using temporal logic specifications. Our goals can involve both qualitative and quantitative time requirements. The key to our method is a technique for checking goal formulas, incrementally, over models of concurrent executions of plans. Our approach covers more general problems than comparable methods and promises an easy integration with standard AI planning search control and heuristic strategies.},

 abstract     = {Use of confirmations in dialogue is mundane and ubiquitous, but theoretically it has been a puzzle how confirmations serve their supposed end, namely to secure the establishment of mutual understandings between dialogue participants. We propose a solution to this confirmation puzzle by introducing the notion of {\em defeasible mutual knowledge}. The notion is based upon our intuition that mutual beliefs obtained in message exchanges are inherently of nonmonotonic nature in the sense that they are revocable by the negating evidences obtained later. We point out that there are two aspects to the notion of defeasible knowledge: optimism and error discovery. We give an analysis of defeasible knowledge within the framework of an epistemic temporal modal logic over distributed systems, and propose a set of conditions for defeasible mutual knowledge. We examine a simple message transmission example and show that confirmations are necessary to obtain defeasible mutual knowledge. We also examine organizational structures for defeasible mutual knowledge for larger groups.},

These generic tasks and methods are defined within five phases (preprocessing, decomposition, control, decision, and postprocessing) of a Generic Integrated Information Processing Architecture symbolic and sub-symbolic (connectionist) systems. The information processing architecture has been based on pragmatic issues like real time, conscious and unconscious/automated behavior, learning, reliability, generalization, incorrect/incomplete information and others. Secondly, based on task, method and phase abstraction of the information processing architecture, a distributed heterogenous computational architecture of symbolic and sub-symbolic agents is developed. Issues associated with computational architecture like communication, parallelism, learning, and others are then discussed. The architecture has been applied in building a real time alrm processing system in a power system control centre with encouraging performance results. About 60 rules and 20 artificial neural networks have been used in alarm processing system.},

In this paper we present an agent algebra which allows the formal description of MAS but also the verification of properties (safety and progress properties) of MAS. This can help the designer to become clear about the design and the correctness of the implementation. Our agent algebra can thus aid in making MAS suitable for control of safety critical systems such as flight control. Our agent algebra, whose terms, structured operational semantics and laws are described in this paper, focuses on interaction of agents. Thus, our agent algebra is especially suited for the description of cooperation and conflict (which is a major concern in MAS) among agents.},

In this paper, we introduce two organizational strategies based on repulsion and attraction to MARTA*. Each agent observes the distances from others and moves as it becomes parted from or approaches others, in contrast it simply moves randomly in the original MARTA*. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate repulsion and attraction are effective in both search time and solution quality for Maze and 15-puzzle respectively. However, the opposite combinations of strategy and problem degrade the performance. We finally discuss why the effectiveness of organizational strategy depends on the problem from a viewpoint of heuristic depression. Observed results suggest that there is a fertile research field which crosses over the traditional heuristic search and the organizational approach in multi-agent environment.},

 abstract     = {A novel approach towards the recognition of interdatabase dependencies (IDD) using a federative agent system FCSI is presented. The architecture of the FCSI is designed as a system of cooperative intelligent autonomous agents each of them uniquely assigned to one local database system. The {\em FCSI aims for a cooperative solution for the problem of finding semantically related information while strictly respecting the autonomy requirements of each individual database system.} For this purpose first a {\em descriptive, terminological meta-knowledge and domain information representation {\sf DIT} on top of the local conceptual database schema} is built at each agent by using user-specified {\em intentional scripts}. In addition, a respectively instantiated actual aspect world {\sf W} enables a more flexible representation of {\em schema object aspects}. According to a prior known set of common terminological primitives {\sf cpc} of respective local {\sf DIT}s remote {\em terminological classification} then serves as a basis for the {\em discovery of intentional IDD}s ({\sf i-IDD}) between objects of different schemas with respect to some or all of their sofar related intentional interpretation aspects. Projections on respective associated {\em aspect valuations at schema and state level} {\sf isp}s determine {\em context-based data sharing} and result in restricted proposals for {\em interdatabase schema assertions} ({\sf IDSA}).\\ In order to organize a {\em cooperative recognition process} of {\sf i-IDD}s between the autonomous FCSI agents a method for decentralized {\em utilitaristic coalition formation} is presented. Moreover, each rational FCSI agent can participate in several different coalitions based on different types of coalition utilities. In this paper the current status of ongoing research on the FCSI is reported.},

 abstract     = {Information agents behave like active intelligent front-ends of stand-alone information systems.The main purpose of such an agent is to gather intensionally relevant information in non-local domains. They may either work as individuals or efficiently cooperate in order to satisfy their own set of given information search tasks. However, in particular the need to respect the database autonomy requirements and to cope with semantic heterogeneity hinders such a cooperation. In this paper we present a solution for handling the autonomy during decentralized information-gathering by rational cooperation. For this purpose, methods for terminological knowledge representation and inference, as well as for utilitarian coalition formation among the information agents, are used. The decentralized agent-utility calculation bases on the agent's productions, resulting from executing tasks of finding dependencies between local terminological information models. There is no prior need nor a possibility to browse through foreign database schemas in order to find some possibly relevant data. The coalition algorithm proposed in this paper enables efficient cooperation via the formation of Kernel-oriented stable coalitions among rationally cooperating information agents in polynomial time.},

 abstract     = {The general goal of using multi agent networks for complex problem solving is the maximisation of the quality of the result to be obtained at minimum cost. Both the general granularity of the agent society and the competence assigned to each individual agent determine the information flow in the network. The great number of parameters involved make it difficult for the designer to optimally adapt the structure of the network to a given class of tasks. In this paper we outline possible network structures and present an approach for determining a number of important statistical parameters characterising the network at a relatively abstract level. The abstraction enables a comparison of different network structures. The methods for the analysis may, however, be readily refined to evaluate a specific problem. As an example we discuss the use of the multi-agent paradigm for structuring the cooperation of sensor networks in robotics. Our analysis is supple-mented by simulation results, which prove a superiority of lateral over pure hierarchical coordination, particularly under severe environmental conditions, such as agent failure.},

We describe our experiences with these technologies as applied to two applications: collaborative engineering and satellite image retrieval. Based on these experiences, we outline the major observed benefits of KQML and matchmaking. In addition, we discuss several problematic issues and potential solutions, including representational challenges in advertising complex databases, the need for persistent requests in information brokering, the dilemma between explicit vs. implicit brokering, problems in error recovery and response timing, consistency among information providers, and efficiency.},

 abstract     = {This paper shows a study on a mechanism for self-organization. A global order is organized by simple and locally coordinated actions of autonomous agents using only very local information, and not by their complex and globally coordinated actions which would use global message passing and high level strategies. The fundamental factors for establishing the global order by self-organization are ``dissipative structure'' and ``self-catalysis mechanism.'' If an environment where agents exist has a dissipative structure and those agents have some sort of self-catalysis mechanisms within themselves, it is possible to form a global order of agents by their simple and locally coordinated actions. ``The blind-hunger's dilemma'' is used as an example to simulate the self-organiza\-tion and coordinated actions of agents and to show the validity of our approach.},

Many coordination protocols such as the contract net protocol have been proposed, and many application-specific coordination protocols are expected to be required soon as more software agents start to be built. However, no general framework has yet been proposed for defining and implementing such coordination protocols. AgenTalk is designed to solve this problem; it allows coordination protocols to be defined incrementally and to be easily customized to suit application domains by incorporating an inheritance mechanism. This paper describes the design policies of AgenTalk and demonstrates its capability by describing the contract net protocol and the multistage negotiation protocol in AgenTalk utilizing its inheritance mechanism. A comparison is made with KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language), and the relationships with related research in distributed artificial intelligence are discussed.},

 abstract     = {This paper proposes a meta-level control mechanism of coordination protocols in a multi-agent system. In an open environment, an agent needs to respond to unexpected situations (exceptions). By introducing a meta-level control mechanism in the coordination protocol execution, an agent can have flexible control over the coordination with other agents. As a meta-level control mechanism, methods to detect and handle exceptions are presented. For example, the proposed mechanism allows an agent to dynamically switch a coordination protocol to use when an exception occurs. In this paper, AgenTalk, a coordination protocol description language, is extended to include primitives for the meta-level control. In this extension, the meta-level control is described using the same mechanism for describing an agent's behavior in a coordination protocol.},

Our techniques allow agents to nearly optimize their communication behavior in a self-organizing and distributed fashion, involving the use of a microeconomic pricing system based on economic laws of supply and demand and trading among agents in real-time. Our analyses are based on three measures of performance: fairness of resource allocation, waiting time for resources, and utilization of resources. Our initial analysis indicates that fairness and utilization are conflicting, in that the best utilization with a fair allocation is equivalent to the worst utilization with an unfair resource allocation, assuming the allocation policy is statically defined. To strike a balance in performance, we have developed mechanisms that establish an artificial economy, where agents can dynamically reallocate goods (resource access) using a competitive market pricing mechanism. However, unlike more common market-oriented methods, our approach does not demand convergence to equilibrium, but permits more rapid, heuristic trading, leading to near optimal performance where both buyers and sellers of resources can benefit. Our studies show that agents employing our mechanisms can dramatically improve utilization while still providing ``fair'' access to the resources.},

As the user operates a conventional Web browser such as Netscape, the agent tracks user behavior and attempts to anticipate items of interest by doing concurrent, autonomous exploration of links from the user's current position.

 abstract     = {Distributed constraint optimization imposes considerable complexity in agents' coordinated search for an optimal solution. However, in many application domains, problems often exhibit special structures that can be exploited to facilitate more efficient problem solving. One of the most recurrent structures involves disparity among subproblems. We present a coordination mechanism, Anchor&Ascend, for distributed constraint optimization that takes advantage of disparity among subproblems to efficiently guide distributed local search for global optimality. The coordination mechanism assigns different overlapping subproblems to agents who must interact and iteratively converge on a solution. In particular, an anchor agent who conducts local best first search to optimize its subsolution interacts with the rest of the agents who perform distributed constraint satisfaction to enforce problem constraints and constraints imposed by the anchor agent. We focus our study on the well-known NP-complete job shop scheduling problem. We define and study two problem structure measures, disparity ratio and disparity composition ratio. We experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of the Anchor&Ascend mechanism on a suite of job shop scheduling problems over a wide range of values of disparity composition. Our experimental results show that (1) considerable advantage can be obtained by explicitly exploiting disparity (2) disparity composition ratio plays a more important role than disparity ratio in finding high quality solution with little computational cost.},

 abstract     = {We consider an environment where agents' tasks are tightly coupled and require real-time scheduling and execution. In order to complete their tasks, agents need to coordinate their actions both constantly and extensively. We present an approach that consists of a standard operating procedure and a look-ahead coordination. The standard operating procedure regulates task coupling and minimizes communication. The look-ahead coordination increases agents' global visibility and provides indicative information for decision adjustment. The goal of our approach is to prune decision myopia while maintaining system responsiveness in real-time, dynamic environments. Experimental results in job shop scheduling problems show that (1) the look-ahead coordination significantly enhances the performance of the standard operating procedure in solution quality, (2) the approach is capable of producing solutions of very high quality in a real-time environment.},

In this paper we lay the foundations for a principled theory of agency and autonomy, and specify the relationship between them.

This allows for a presentation of the semantics of cooperation primitives: interagent messages supporting cooperation, comprised of speech acts operating upon objects occuring in the basic loop. The formal semantics of cooperation primitives gives a meaning to indiviudal messages, independent from the cooperation protocol. Thus, agents can reason about exchanged messages and are able to dynamically create their own methods for cooperation.},

As an alternative, the agents might use descriptions. When agents refer to domain objects by using descriptions, referent misidentifications (RMIs) will occur. This paper formally models recovery from RMIs among such agents. We show how the RMI recovery problem can be cast in a belief revision framework and how recovery can be effected with relatively simple mechanisms. For instance, neither agent explicitly reasons about the beliefs of others.},

In our approach the environment is described, from a symbolic point of view, by means of a graph; clustering techniques allow for further levels of abstraction to be defined, leading to a multi-layered representation. In this work we propose an unsupervised exploration algorithm in which several agents cooperate to acquire knowledge of the environment at the different abstraction levels; a broadcast model is adopted for inter-agent communication. All agents are structurally equal and pursue the same local exploration strategy; nevertheless, the existence of multiple levels of abstraction in the environment representation allows for the agents' behaviours to differentiate. Agents carry out exploration at different abstraction levels, aimed at reproducing an ideal exploration profile; each agent selects dynamically its exploration level, based on the current demand.},

 abstract     = {In the first part of this paper, a framework for the definition and classification of agent reseach is proposed. The major implication of this framework is that for systems embedded in a dynamic environment an approach based on highly autonomous and siutated agents is called for. In the main part of the paper, an architecture and a design process of complex agents are proposed. This is illustrated with a coaching application. In our architecture, a complex agent consists of a {"}society{"} of agents which are designed in an incremental, bottom-up manner according to what we call a behavioural engineering approach. The agents operate in parallel and have a close coupling between perception and action. Emergent functionality and memory-based learning characterize the adaptive behaviour of the agents. Furture research will focus on additional learning processes for the agents and will explore the concept of plans as a resource for situated action.},

The formalization extends the traditional framework, e.g., prisoner's dilemma, by incorporating the influence on the payoff matrix at some future point by executing an action at the present time. This enables us to explain why cooperative behaviors emerge in human interactions even though from a myopic view, cooperative behaviors do not seem to be profitable. Furthermore, we propose a new method for selecting an action in such a framework. The method overcomes the drawbacks of previous methods. Our proposed method can yield cooperative behavior and is not time-consuming. We analyze the property of our method by using a simple model. Finally, we compare previous methods and our method by evaluating some example problems in terms of efficiency, stability and simplicity.},

 abstract     = {Agents that interact in a distributed environment might increase their utility by behaving optimally given the strategies of the other agents. To do so, agents need to learn about those with whom they share the same world. This paper examines interactions among agents from a game theoretic perspective. In this context, learning has been assumed as a means to reach equilibrium. We analyze the complexity of this learning process. We start with a restricted two--agent model, in which agents are represented by finite automata, and one of the agents plays a fixed strategy. We show that even with this restrictions, the learning process may be exponential in time. We then suggest a criterion of simplicity, that induces a class of automata that are learnable in polynomial time.},

 abstract     = {This paper examines the integration of computational complexity into game theoretic models. The example focused on is the Prisoner's Dilemma, repeated for a finite length of time. We show that a minimal bound on the players' computational ability is sufficient to enable cooperative behavior. In addition, a variant of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game is suggested, in which players have the choice of opting out. This modification enriches the game and suggests dominance of cooperative strategies. Competitive analysis is suggested as a tool for investigating sub-optimal (but computationally tractable) strategies and game theoretic models in general. Using competitive analysis, it is shown that for bounded players, a sub-optimal strategy might be the optimal choice, given resource limitations.},

A graph representation is used to model the plans of each agent and a multicriteria ``best'' path procedure can be used in order to obtain the ``best'' path for each agent considering her/his private goals. In our approach private and local goals do not necessarily coincide. A conflict and/or positive cooperation may occur and a detection procedure is triggered as soon as the agents broadcast their ``best plans''. A negotiation process is the established if necessary. Such a process iterates the use of the graph representation and of the ``best'' path algorithm to a level including the agents that have to negotiate. The parameters of the multicriteria model used to evaluate the paths are then negotiated or even the model itself. Some open problems conclude the paper.},

 abstract     = {Visionary projections of a wide-area network teeming with intelligent agents describe an environment where end-users and their agents can pick and choose among a great variety of potentially valuable information services. However, neither network capabilities nor users' time and money are infinite. Computational markets provide one type of mechanism for allocating limited resources in such an environment in a distributed, dynamic way. Moreover, the underlying economic theory provides an analytical framework for predicting aggregate behavior and designing individual agents. In this paper, we describe a prototypical computational market model for information services distributed over a network. Our initial focus is on the economic problem of when and where to establish mirror sites for the more popular information services. Competitive agents choose to set up mirrors based on going prices for network bandwidth, computational resources, and the information service. Depending on the experimental setup, we observed a range of qualitative behaviors.},

 abstract     = {The goal of this paper is to present a model for systems of situated autonomous agents and to illustrate its application to distributed automated deduction. Our model is based on a sharp distinction between the environment and agent dynamics. In particular, it allows to express how the environment is modified by simultaneously performed actions, to formalize in a very general way the internal activity of an agent in terms of its decision processes (which are based on its own perceptions), and finally to describe the interactions between the agents and the environment, and among themselves. In the application to automated deduction, we integrate our model with the concept of OMRS (Open Mechanized Reasoning System) which distinguishes the logical, the control, and the interaction components of a theorem prover. In this setting, the environment consists of the proof structure, represented as a labelled graph, built when trying to prove a conjecture. The agents, described as OMRS, are situated on the nodes of this graph and act on its nodes and edges (e.g. they may add new nodes). Some experimental results based on a simple example are provided in order to illustrate the potentialities of our approach.},

 abstract     = {Agent augmented reality is proposed in this paper as a new research area that uses agent technologies for the augmentation of our real world environment by actively integrating information worlds. We introduce a special agent called a real world agent. A real world agent is a software agent that can support its user in performing tasks in real world environments, such as place-to-place location guidance, instruction in physical tasks, and augmentation of human knowledge related to the physical environment. In order for the agent to achieve these tasks, the agent should be aware of the user's real world situation. The detection of real world situations is performed through the integration of various methods, including location-awareness using a global positioning system, object recognition through machine-recognizable IDs (barcodes, infrared rays, etc.), and the processing of visual/spoken inputs. IDs of static objects (e.g., doors, ceilings, walls, etc.) can also give clues to the location-awareness system. When a real world agent correctly deduces the real world situation and the intentions of its user, it can access information worlds (e.g., the Internet) in the same manner as other software agents. In this way, the real world and information worlds can be dynamically integrated. Real world agents can detect real world situations, interact with humans, and perform tasks in information space.},

We have been developing LEMMING, a task negotiation system with low communication load for multiple autonomous mobile robots. For controlling multiple robots, Contract Net Protocol(CNP) is useful, but the broadcast of the Task Announcement messages on CNP tends to consume much communication load. So LEMMING learns proper addressees for the Task Announcement messages with Case-Based Reasoning so as to suppress the broadcast. The learning method is called Addressee Learning. In this paper, we extend LEMMING with `directed contract' to reduce the communication load more effectively. Moreover, we extend LEMMING with `forgetting' to restrict the number of cases, since it is impossible to have enough memory to keep all the cases. The efficiency of LEMMING is evaluated in a simulated multi-robot environment to show that these extension are effective for LEMMING.},

Most of these straightforward reinforcement-learning approaches, however, scale poorly to more complex multi-agent learning problems, because the state space for each learning agent grows exponentially in the number of its partner agents engaged in the joint task. In this paper, we consider a modified version of the Pursuit Problem as a multi-agent learning problem which is computationally intractable by these straightforward approaches. We show how successfully a collection of modular Q-learning hunter agents synthesize coordinated decision policies needed to capture a randomly-fleeing prey agent effectively, by specializing their individual functionality and synthesizing herding behavior.},

 abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a metalevel coordination strategy to implement an adaptive organization for reactive cooperative planning. The adaptive organization changes its organizational scheme adaptively as a means of coping with the dynamic problem spaces. Preliminary experiments shows that an adaptive organization can be made to the increase efficiency in dynamic problem spaces. The reason for this works is that reducing the degree of freedom in the problem space, while increasing the degree of interaction, demands greater coordination. However, if the number of effective local plans decrease, it would seem likely that if the agents were to have a better metalevel strategy, they would be better able to search this reduced space efficiently. The metalevel coordination incorporates an agent-wide metalevel heuristic function. In designing the metalevel coordination strategy, we take three aspects of reactive cooperative planning into account. These aspects include: the difference in the degree of achievement in successive turns; the certainty of shared information; and the degree of freedom of choice for agent's behavior. The adaptive organization works efficiently in cases where the communication cost is relatively expensive.},

 abstract     = {Forming a contract among self-interested agents often requires complex, strategic thinking. For instance, a self-interested agent (contractee) will perform a task of another agent (contractor) only when doing it is its own interest, and therefore to form a successful contract, the contractor needs to provide incentives to the contractee, such as proposing a payment higher than the contractee's cost of doing the task. In this paper, we focus on the contractor's strategic decision problem of what payment to offer to maximize its expected utility, and propose a method for a self-interested contractor to determine the best payment to offer. We present a four-step decision-making mechanism using a stochastic Markov-process (MP) model, which captures various factors that influence the utility value and uncertainties associated with them. The MP-based mechanism enables a contractor to choose different optimal payments depending on the payment(s) of the other contractor(s) or the contractees' costs of doing the task, and therefore to receive a better profit. The experiment demonstrates strategic thinking-thinking about not only oneself but also the contractees and the other competing contractors-is indeed advantageous.},

 abstract     = {The need for negotiation in multi-agent systems stems from the requirement for agents to solve the problems posed by their interdependence upon one another. Negotiation provides a solution to these problems by giving the agents the means to resolve their conflicting objectives, correct inconsistencies in their knowledge of other agents' world view, and co-ordinate a joint approach to domain tasks which benefits all the agents concerned. We propose a framework, based upon a system of argumentation, which permits agents to negotiate to establish acceptable ways to solve problems.},

 abstract     = {In the MAS/DAI community, most current work on speech acts focuses on formalizing individual utterances. The next stage will exploit the theory's power to explicate relationships within conversations, or groups of utterances. Computer scientists naturally seek to visualize these relationship in terms of graphs, focusing either on the identities of the individual agents involved or the states through which participating agents move. This paper introduces an alternative formalism, the Dooley Graph. It reviews the kinds of relations that can exist among individual communicative actions (including both speech acts and non-speech acts), shows the strengths and weaknesses of participant and state graphs, explains the derivation of Dooley Graphs, and suggests their value for designing agents and analyzing the behavior of communities of agents.},

 abstract     = {When we design multi-agent systems for realistic, worth-oriented environments, solving the coordination problems they present involves understanding the intricate and sophisticated interplay between the domain and the various system components. In this paper, we examine this interplay using TAEMS and the GPGP (Generalized Partial Global Planning) approach as a tool for quickly exploring multiple alternative organizations/coordination strategies. We illustrate the flexibility of TAEMS-style task structures for representing interesting multi-criteria coordination problems, and the use of a new grammar-based generation tool to allow quicker task structure experimentation. Using Distributed Data Processing as an example domain, we show how different coordination algorithms of varying sophistication give rise to subtle effects in functionally-structured agent organizations with interrelationships between functions. The experiments presented in our paper serve to illustrate our claim about the generality and flexibility of the TAEMS representation for coordination problems and the grammar-based generators for modeling domain semantics and experimenting with different aspects of such domains.},

It attempts to demonstrate the viability and utility of self-organization in an agent-based system involving complex interactions within the agent set. We present a multi-agent parametric design system called L-TEAM where a set of heterogeneous agents learn their organizational roles in negotiated search for mutually acceptable designs. We tested the system on a steam condenser design domain and empirically demonstrated its usefulness. L-TEAM produced better results than its non-learning predecessor, TEAM, which required elaborate knowledge engineering to hand-code organizational roles for its agent set. In addition, we discuss experiments with L-TEAM that highlight the importance of certain learning issues in multi-agent systems.},

As its title suggests, Coach is a simulator of sporting environments, as these possess the required motivations for such behaviour and have the potential to benefit the real sporting world. In addition to describing Coach, this paper describes two applications illustrating the potential and value of the system. It examines cooperation within a simplified model of the game of volleyball in which cooperation emerged in the form of players passing the ball between them in order to control it for an effective offensive hit. Each player learnt a specialized skill which, in close harmony with the other team member's skills, provided the team with a strategy not unlike those used by real volleyball players. Some preliminary experiments were also carried out to investigate communication among team members.},

This paper explores a particular type of rational agent, a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent. The primary aim of this paper is to integrate (a) the theoretical foundations of BDI agents from both a quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a symbolic reasoning perspective; (b) the implementations of BDI agents >from an ideal theoretical perspective and a more practical perspective; and (c) the building of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. In particular, an air-traffic management application will be analyzed from both a theoretical and an implementation perspective.},

 abstract     = {In this paper we discuss a number of previously unaddressed issues that arise in automated negotiation among self-interested agents whose rationality is bounded by computational complexity. These issues are presented in the context of iterative task allocation negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such choices through conditional commitment breaking penalties is presented. Next, the implications of bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs between allocated computation and negotiation benefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques for linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts are presented as methods for escaping local optima in the task allocation process. Implementing both methods among self-interested bounded rational agents is discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion among self-interested agents is described, and alternative remedies are presented.},

 abstract     = {Auctions provide an efficient distributed mechanism for solving problems such as task and resource allocation in multiagent systems. In the Vickrey auction - which has been widely advocated for automated auctions - the best bid wins the auction, but at the second best price. In certain settings this promotes truthful bidding and avoids counterspeculation. This paper analyses the circumstances when this protocol is appropriate, and explicates the desirable properties and lack thereof in varied settings. The first part of the paper discusses known deficiencies of the Vickrey auction: bidder collusion, a lying auctioneer, promotion of lying in non-private-value auctions, lower revenue than alternative protocols, and the necessity to reveal sensitive information. The second part of the paper presents our results regarding new limitations of the protocol, which arise especially among computational agents. These include inefficient allocation and lying in sequential auctions of interrelated items, untruthful bidding when a risk averse agent has local uncertainty, and the need for counterspeculation to make deliberation control (or information gathering) decisions when an agent has local uncertainty.},

 abstract     = {Q-learning is a recent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore it is well-suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is the fixed strategy Tit-for-Tat, while in others it is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play optimally against Tit-for-Tat. Playing against another learner was more difficult because the adaptation of the other learner creates a nonstationary environment in ways that are detailed in the paper. The learners that were studied varied along three dimensions: the length of history they received as context, the type of memory they employed (lookup tables based on restricted history windows or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties when playing against other learners, agents with longer history windows, lookup table memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.},

We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, improtan features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local inforamtion available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive beehavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and expose various phenomena related to the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. In addition, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even deteriorate system efficiency.},

 abstract     = {Distributed planning is fundamental to the generation of co-operative activities in Multi-Agent Systems. It requires both an adequate plan representation and efficient interacting methods allowing agents to coordinate their plans. This paper proposes a recursive model for the representation and the handling of plans by means of Recursive Petri Nets (RPN) which support the specification of concurrent activities, reasoning about simultaneous actions and continuous processes, a theory of verification and mechanisms of transformation (e.g. abstraction, refinement, merging). The main features of the RPN formalism are domain independence, broad coverage of interacting situations and operational coordination. This paper also provides an approach to the interleaving of execution and planning which is based on the RPN semantics and gives some significant methods allowing plan management in distributed planning. It goes on to show how this approach can be used to coordinate agents' plans in a shared and dynamic environment.},

Such assumptions, however, are untenable in open systems. Agent designers have to design agents and agent environments with the understanding that participating agents will act to serve their self-interests instead of working towards group goals. We investigate the choice of interaction strategies and environmental characteristics that will make the best self-interested actions to be cooperative in nature. We analyze the inadequacy of traditional deterministic reciprocity mechanisms to promote cooperative behavior with a fair distribution of the workload. A probabilistic reciprocity mechanism is introduced and shown to generate stable and cooperative behavior among a group of self-interested agents. The resultant system exhibits close to optimal throughput with a fair distribution of the workload among the participating agents.},

 abstract     = {A key concern about the design of multiagent systems is the tradeoff between local autonomy and global performance. If agents can be assumed to be working towards a common goal or to be cooperative in nature, significant overall performance improvements can be obtained over selfish and uncooperative agents. In a distributed and open system, assumptions about a system-wide common goal or about the philanthropic nature of agents are unrealistic. We provide a simple behavioral rule based on reciprocity that allows autonomous agents to effectively share workload with others. We use a package delivery domain to demonstrate how reciprocal behavior can allow agents to produce desirable global performance without sacrificing individual autonomy or efficiency. More interestingly, we show that agents who do not help others are less efficient with this mechanism than agents who share workloads with others. As a result, the best self-motivated actions lead to system-wide cooperation.},

We argue that agents should be provided with deep domain knowledge that allos them to make justifiable decisions, rather than shallow models of users to mimic. In this paper, we use the application domain of distributed meeting scheduling to investigate how agents embodying deeper domain knowledge can choose among alternative strategies for searching their calendars in order to create flexible schedules within reasonable cost.},

In general it is assumed that the more accurate and up-to-date the available information, the better is the expected performance of the individual and the group. This conclusion can be challenged in a number of scenarios. We investigate the use of limited information by agents in choosing between one of several different options, and conclude that if agents are deliberately kept ignorant about any number of options, the entire group can converge faster to a stable and optimal configuration. We also demonstrate how a couple of coalition formation schemes improves the rate of convergence and conclude that a variable, rather than fixed, coalition formation mechanism is more effective.},

Among the design issues, we identify the coordination mechanisms and learning schemes used to be of particular importance. These two aspects, therefore are the focus of the discussions. Examples of cooperative problem solving systems, such as a networked expert system testbed and an intelligent agent system for concurrent design, are used to illustrate the distributed artificial intelligence approach. In addition, multi-agent learning methods are described and evaluated, so that some of their characteristics and important parameters can be identified. Such a comprehensive survey is aimed at providing the foundation for building future multi-agent information systems.},

Agent coalition formation typically requires that each agent must be a member of only one coalition. This may lead to a waste of resources and capabilities. Therefore, we present algorithms that lead agents to the formation of overlapping coalitions, where each coalition is assigned a goal. The algorithms we present are appropriate for agents working as a Distributed Problem Solving system in non-super-additive environments. They are any-time distributed algorithms with a low computational complexity and low ratio-bound.},

The individuals or the individual groups of the multidisciplinary design teams work parallelly and independently with the different engineering tools which are located in the different sites for often a long time. In order to ensure the coordination of the design activities of the different groups or the cooperation among the different engineering tools, it is necessary to develop an efficient distributed intelligent design environment. This paper proposes a distributed architecture for integrating such engineering tools in an open design environment organized as a population of asynchronous cognitive agents. Before introducing the general architecture and the communication protocol, issues about the agent architecture and the inter-agent communication are discussed. A prototype of such an environment with seven independent agents located in the different workstations and microcomputers is presented. A small mechanical design example is used for testing such an environment.},

In this paper we first place ourselves as an external observer to analyse the possible coupled outcomes of the social reasoning mechanisms of two different agents. We show that in some particular cases, different inferred dependence situations imply that the agents' mutual representations are inconsistent at an agency level. Then, we detail our analysis in a particular case where the agents have the same plans (and believe in that), showing that some particular coupled outcomes can be explained either by incorrectness or incompleteness of mutual representation. In order to do that, we extend our previous model by introducing the notion of goal situation. Finally, we conclude by showing that these properties may be detected by the agents themselves if we supply them with an internal mechanism where they can manipulate the outcomes inferred both by their own social reasoning mechanism and by those of the others.},

 abstract     = {For the purpose of designing coordination mechanisms for CSCW systems ('computational mechanisms of interaction') that support cooperating actors in managing the complexity of articulating their distributed and yet interdependent activities, a multi-agent architecture is proposed. Based on evidence from empirical studies of uses of artifactually embodied protocols for articulating cooperative activities, a set of constitutive agents and a characterization of their communication needs has been derived. The paper focuses on the primitives devoted to dynamic reconfiguration of computational mechanisms of interaction (C-MOIs), distributed cooperative control of propagation of changes to C-MOIs, and interoperation among multiple C-MOIs. The agents' Communication Language is constituted by primitives representing various modes of relating C-MOIs: reference, awareness, recursiveness, and linking.},

 abstract     = {Epistemic utility theory, originally developed to model single-agent cognitive decision-making, is extended to the multi-agent case and applied to practical coordinated decision-making. For an M-agent society, individual and multiple agent coordination information is contained in a 2M-dimensional coordination space. The coordination function is a joint probability mass (or density) function defined over the coordination space that characterizes: (a) each individual agent's goals and standards; (b) each individual agent's abductive considerations, such as cost, hazard, or resource consumption; and (c) information pertaining to the interactions within the society, such as cooperation, competition, exploitation, compromise, tolerance, and indifference. The coordination function is used to derive two joint utilities, termed accuracy and rejectability, and a joint version of Levi's rule of epistemic utility is applied to identify the satisficing set of decision vectors that represent jointly rational behavior for the society.},

 abstract     = {Coordination is an essential technique in cooperative, distributed multi-agent systems. However, sophisticated coordination strategies are not always cost-effective in all problem-solving situations. This paper presents a learning method to acquire coordination plans for specific problem-solving situations so that the appropriate type of coordination strategy is used. This learning is accomplished by recording and analyzing traces of inferences after problem solving. The analysis results in identification of situations where inappropriate coordination strategies have caused redundant activities or the lack of timely execution of important activities, thus degrading system performance. Based on this identification, situation-specific coordination plans are created which use additional non-local information about activities in the networks to remedy the problem. An example from a real distributed problem-solving application involving diagnosis of a local area network is described.},

@inproceedings{Sugawara:1995:RPP,
 abstract     = {This paper describes plan reuse in multiagent domains. In distributed planning, a plan is created by distributed centers of planner agents that have their own viewpoints. Plan reuse where a past plan result is reused for the new problem was proposed for single-agent planning and can achieve efficient planning. A special issue for applying it to distributed planning is that, even if the local agent thinks that the new problem is identical to a past problem, other agents may have quite different goals. Another issue is to realize efficient distributed planning, like in a single-agent case. This paper shows that the past plan can be reused regardless of other agents' goals under the assumption that the initial state has only ``in-facts.'' A generated plan and related information are stored as a plan template so that an agent can reuse it in future planning. This information includes generated plans, subgoals, non-local effects that may affect or be affected by other agents' plans, and their conflict resolution methods that were actually used. An agent can create a plan efficiently using a template, because it can skip a part of planning actions, detect conflicts in an early stage, and reduce communication costs. First, this paper presents the planning-with-reuse framework. Then how plan templates are created and reused is also illustrated using some block world examples. Finally, we experimentally show that efficient distributed planning can be achieved.},

Ontologies give a background of knowledge to share among agents, that is, systems of concepts are defined which are used to communicate to each other. We present three different ontologies, namely, ontologies for object, space, and action. Based on these ontologies, we then show mediation mechanism to generate action sequences for agents from given tasks. Our framework is appropriate for cooperation among heterogeneous real-world agents because of (1) adaptiveness for environments and agents, (2) implicit representation of cooperation, and (3) integration of information and real-world agents. We realized and verified our mediation mechanism by applying task planning for mobile robots and computer-controlled instruments.},

 abstract     = {Agent tracking is an important capability that an intelligent automated agent requires for interacting with other agents. It involves monitoring the observable actions of other agents as well as inferring their unobserved actions or high-level plans, goals and behaviors. This paper analyzes the challenges of agent tracking in a {"}real-world{"}, dynamic, multi-agent environment of air-combat simulation. An intelligent automated pilot in this environment faces the challenge of tracking the highly flexible actions and behaviors of other individuals or groups of pilots, while interacting with them, and dealing with imperfect sensors and real-time pressures. The paper introduces an approach for recursive agent tracking that enables an automated pilot to meet this challenge, and even take advantage of the imperfect sensors to engage in deception. The paper introduces some optimizations to address real-time pressures and presents experimental data from an actual implementation to illustrate their impact. Agents in other competitive or collaborative dynamic multi-agent environments, such as {"}virtual reality{"} environments, could conceivably benefit from this agent tracking approach.},

 abstract     = {Flexible teamwork in real-world multi-agent domains is more than a union of agents' simultaneous execution of individual plans, even if such execution pre-coordinated. Indeed, uncertainties in complex, dynamic domains often obstruct pre-planned coordination, with a resultant breakdown in teamwork. The central hypothesis in this paper is that for durable teamwork, agents should be provided explicit team plans and an underlying model of teamwork that explicitly outlines their commitments and responsibilities as participants in team activities. Such a model enables team members to flexibly reason about coordination activities. The underlying model we have provided is based on the joint intentions framework; although we present some key modifications to reflect the practical constraints in (some) real-world domains. This framework has been implemented in the context of a real-world synthetic environment for helicopter-combat simulation; some empirical results are presented.},

Typically, team selection occurs at run-time using a first principles approach, for example after agents have exchanged relevant information about their abilities, loads, or other status. In time-critical domains such approaches may be impractical. Our work assumes that agents have limited resources and are embedded in a continuously changing world. We provide a mechanism whereby system developers can describe ``recipes'' for team selection in terms of the required abilities of the team, and appropriate run-time constraints. We refer to such recipes as allocations. The paper provides definitions and algorithms, and includes comparisons with related work.},

A basic agent model has been developed and is used to characterize the agents of the MAS. Using this model three classes of agents have been currently identified and incorporated into the MAS testbed. These are: the user interface agent which serves as the main point of interaction between a user and the MAS; an agent manager which is responsible for coordinating the activities of a community of agents within the MAS; and domain agents whose specialized knowledge enable them to accomplish domain-specific tasks. In the context of the MAS testbed we are able to address several research issues such as user modeling, cooperative activity among agents, handling incomplete requests, and inter-agent and human user-to-agent interactions.},

 abstract     = {The modeling of cooperative processes has up to now relied almost exclusively on traditional cognitive approaches, employing explicit representations of goals, beliefs and actions, as seen from an observer's viewpoint, thus underemphasizing the role of internal agent architectures. We propose here a generalized tit-for-tat agent model that is completely reactive and possesses the properties of adaptivity and scalability. We show how this (socio)biological model can be used to account for social behavior, i.e. behavior depending explicitly on the interaction of an agent with other agents in its environment. This is achieved through the defi- nition of {"}social{"} objects or properties, which can be abstract or have a material form, and that are perceivable, accessible and manipulable by the agents. Agents have internal, built-in, or else genetic, motivations to regulate these objects/properties to certain limits and act accordingly. The result of those actions are then visible and directly perceivable by all the agents of the community who seek individually to satisfy their internal needs according to this social feedback. To deploy the potential of the approach, we present three examples from different domains and de- monstrate on several instantiations of the same basic model a variety of social phenomena that derive from the differential expression of those matching motivations of individual agents. The power of the approach may be partly attributed to the presence of genetic variations in the agents' parameters which give rise to intricate dynamics. Finally, we give a sketch of the level of complexity that the system may attain and we briefly expose its relation with predictive systems.},

We provide a framework for the incremental implementation of modeling capabilities in agents. These agents were implemented and different populations simulated in order to learn more about their behavior and the merits of using agent models. Our results show, among other lessons, how savvy buyers can avoid being ``cheated'' by sellers, how price volatility can be used to quantitatively predict the benefits of deeper models, and how specific types of agent populations influence system behavior.},

Pruning away less important models allows an agent to take its {"}best{"} action in a timely manner, given its knowledge, computational abilities, and time constraints. We describe a theoretical framewwork, based on situations, for talking about recursive agent models and the strategies and expected strategies associated with them. This framework allows us to rigorously define the gain of continuing deliberation versus taking action. The expected gain of computational actionss is used to guide the pruning of the nested model structure. We have implemented our approach on a canonical multi-agent problem, the pursuit task, to illustrate how real-time, mulit-agent decision-making can be based on a principled, combinatorial model. Test results show a marked decrease in deliberation time while maintaining a good performance level.},

Instead of using the mouse and menus to manipulate scene details in a virtual environment we communicate with the system by way of natural language. Our aim is to keep the user (designer) free from technical considerations such as planning of geometric details, etc. Taking special responsibilities in mediating verbal instructions, the VIENA agents cooperate with each other and with the user to offer a goal scene meeting the user's wants. We explain the VIENA multiagent system, give an example application in virtual design, and discuss general advantages of multiagent systems in human-computer interaction.},

Such conventions play a central role in naturally-occurring social systems, and there are good reasons for supposing that they will play a similarly important role in artificial social systems. Following a short review of conventions and their use in distributed artificial intelligence, we present a formal model that rigorously defines both our experimental methodology, and the performance measures we use to quantify the success of our experiments. We then describe sixteen different mechanisms for bringing about agreement on conventions, and present experimental results obtained for each of these methods. A tentative analysis of these results is given, and the paper concludes with some comments and issues for future work.},

Earlier work has shown that (1) multiagent MSBNs can be applied to distributed interpretation tasks; and (2) a distributed communication operation can be used to ensure the global consistency among agents. In this paper, we address the following problem: During a communication operation, each agent is unavailable to process new evidence for a time interval (called off-line time). We consider the minimization of total length of off-line time of the entire system. To concentrate on the factors affecting the off-line time, we abstract communication in MSBNs into a graphical model for off-line time study. Using the model, we present the optimal schedules when communication is initiated from an arbitrarily selected agent. We show now the optimal schedules can be constructed in a distributed fashion.},

This paper provides a decentralized approach to allocate QoS through a market. In our approach, each agent makes decisions according to its local knowledge and interests that change dynamically, and prices adjust to clear the market in each resource. The market prices reflect system-wide values, inducing agents to produce and consume appropriate amounts of the various resources. We describe a market model for allocating bandwidth in an actual networked meeting environment called FreeWalk. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of the market-based approach to allocating QoS for multimedia network applications.},

Our simulation results demonstrate that our approach is very efficient with a superlinear rate of convergence to equilibrium and an excellent scalability, requiring few iterations even when the number of agents is in the order of one thousand. A framework for analysis of this and similar problems is given which shows how nonlinear optimization and numerical mathematics can be exploited to characterize, compare, and tailor problem-solving strategies in market-oriented programming.},

This algorithm removes the common drawback of backtracking algorithms, i.e., one bad decision in value selection becomes fatal when solving large-scale problems, while its completeness is guaranteed. The basic ideas of this algorithm are as follows: (i) bad decisions are revised without an exhaustive search by changing the priority order of agents dynamically, (ii) the probability of bad decisions being made is reduced by selecting values cooperatively using the min-conflict heuristic [Minton et al. 92]. Although these ideas are very simple and domain independent, experimental results indicate that this algorithm can solve large-scale problems, which can not be solved efficiently by backtracking algorithms. These results imply that the algorithm's efficiency can actually be improved by adopting intuitively natural notions, i.e., the fair establishment of the priority order, and the cooperative value selection considering the situations of other agents.},

 abstract     = {This paper presents a new algorithm for solving distributed constraint satisfaction problems (distributed CSPs) called the distributed breakout algorithm, which is inspired by the breakout algorithm for solving centralized CSPs. In this algorithm, each agent tries to optimize its evaluation value (the number of constraint violations) by exchanging its current value and the possible amount of its improvement among neighboring agents. Instead of detecting the fact that agents as a whole are trapped in a local-minimum, each agent detects whether it is in a quasi-local-minimum, which is a weaker condition than a local-minimum, and changes the weights of constraint violations to escape from the quasi-local-minimum. Experimental evaluations show this algorithm to be much more efficient than existing algorithms for critically difficult problem instances of distributed graph-coloring problems.},

 abstract     = {A new cooperative search algorithm that introduces a GA-like selection mechanism is developed. In this algorithm, a state-space search problem is solved concurrently by multiple agents, each of which executes the Real-Time-A* algorithm. These agents compete for existence, i.e., each agent periodically reproduces offspring stochastically based on its fitness defined by the heuristic estimation value of its current state, so that an agent in a good state tends to reproduce many offspring while an agent in a bad state tends to be exterminated. Experimental evaluations show that this algorithm is very effective for problems that can be divided into serializable subgoals (e.g., n-puzzles), although the agents do not have any knowledge about these subgoals. In particular, this algorithm can solve the 48-puzzle, which can not be solved by existing heuristic search algorithms consistently within a reasonable amount of time unless the knowledge about the subgoals is explicitly given.},

 abstract     = {The dynamics of resource contention in multiagent systems with imperfect information can be extremely complex. It was shown by Hogg and Huberman that when agents can follow different strategies in a system with resource contention, it is possible to render otherwise unstable and chaotic behavior into equilibrium. In a number of computer experiments we explore this mechanism and find the existence of bursty behavior which sporadically punctuates the existing equilibrium. This phenomenon is shown to arise out of the underlying fluctuations of the multiagent system. This mechanism of equilibria punctuated by bursts of erratic activity appears to be quite general in systems where agents explore strategies in search of local improvements.},

Based on these results, necessary conditions of synthesis strategies in different synthesis cases and two methodologies to solve the problem of synthesis of solutions in DESs are proposed. A computational strategy by using analysis methods and a neural network strategy which is an example of inductive methods are introduced in detail for solving synthesis problems in conflict synthesis cases. Both methodologies are evaluated and compared.},

@inproceedings{Zhang:1995:CUD,
 abstract     = {This paper deals with the consensus of uncertainties in distributed expert systems (DESs). It claims that the different uncertainties of a solution from different expert systems constitute not only a conflict case, but also non-conflict cases. We will refer both the conflict case and non-conflict cases as synthesis cases. The first objective of this paper is to classify the synthesis {\it cases}, identify the {\it types} of DESs, and recognize the {\it relationships} among the different synthesis cases and the different types of DESs. On the basis of this, a computational synthesis strategy is proposed to obtain a consensus of uncertainties in a conflict case. Within this strategy, the conflict case is further classified into two sub-cases, and two corresponding sub-strategies are proposed, in which both uncertainties and authorities are taken into consideration. A synthesis strategy based on neural networks is also proposed in a conflict case. In this strategy, as long as enough patterns have been obtained from human experts, neural networks can be trained to match all patterns. This strategy can simulate human experts reasonably well. Tests have also shown that a fixed neural network architecture can be used to solve conflict problems, with a variable number of inputs and outputs. That means only a small number of neural networks are required to solve all conflicts, thus the neural network can be used in real DESs. Finally, a computational synthesis strategy is compared to a neural network synthesis strategy. Both strategies have advantage and disadvantage and are adapt to different situations.},
