 abstract     = {Nonparametric regression is a set of techniques for estimating a regression curve without making strong assumptions about the shape of the true regression function. These techniques are therefore useful for building and checking parametric models, as well as for data description. Kernel and nearest-neighbor regression estimators are local versions of univariate location estimators, and so they can readily be introduced to beginning students and consulting clients who are familiar with such summaries as the sample mean and median.},

 abstract     = {Because of the changing nature of spam, a spam filtering system that uses machine learning will need to be dynamic. This suggests that a case-based (memory-based) approach may work well. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a lazy approach to machine learning where induction is delayed to run time. This means that the case base can be updated continuously and new training data is immediately available to the induction process. In this paper we present a detailed description of such a system called ECUE and evaluate design decisions concerning the case representation. We compare its performance with an alternative system that uses Na{\"\i}ve Bayes. We find that there is little to choose between the two alternatives in cross-validation tests on data sets. However, ECUE does appear to have some advantages in tracking concept drift over time.},

The interface to GraphGrep is a regular expression graph query language Glide that combines features from Xpath and Smart. Glide incorporates both single node and variable-length wildcards. Our algorithm uses hash-based fingerprinting to represent the graphs in an abstract form and to filter the database. GraphGrep has been tested on databases of size up to 16,000 molecules and performs well in this entire range.},

 abstract     = {Data management is growing in complexity as large-scale applications take advantage of the loosely coupled resources brought together by grid middleware and by abundant storage capacity. Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources. The provenance of data products generated by complex transformations such as workflows is of considerable value to scientists. From it, one can ascertain the quality of the data based on its ancestral data and derivations, track back sources of errors, allow automated re-enactment of derivations to update a data, and provide attribution of data sources. Provenance is also essential to the business domain where it can be used to drill down to the source of data in a data warehouse, track the creation of intellectual property, and provide an audit trail for regulatory purposes. In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance techniques, and apply the classification to current research efforts in the field. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it. Our synthesis can help those building scientific and business metadata-management systems to understand existing provenance system designs. The survey culminates with an identification of open research problems in the field.},

 abstract     = {The increasing ability for the sciences to sense the world around us is resulting in a growing need for data driven applications that are under the control of workflows composed of services on the Grid. The focus of our work is on provenance collection for these workflows, necessary to validate the workflow and to determine quality of generated data products. The challenge we address is to record uniform and usable provenance metadata that meets the domain needs while minimizing the modification burden on the service authors and the performance overhead on the workflow engine and the services. The framework is based on generating discrete provenance activities during the lifecycle of a workflow execution that can be aggregated to form complex data and process provenance graphs that can span across workflows. The implementation uses a loosely-coupled publish-subscribe architecture for propagating these activities and the capabilities of the system satisfies the needs of detailed provenance collection. A performance evaluation of a prototype finds a minimal performance overhead (in the range of 1% for an eight service workflow using 271 data products).},

 abstract     = {<P>Differences in features supported by the various contemporary commercial workflow management systems point to different insights of <I>suitability</I> and different levels of <I>expressive power</I>. The challenge, which we undertake in this paper, is to systematically address workflow requirements, from basic to complex. Many of the more complex requirements identified, recur quite frequently in the analysis phases of workflow projects, however their implementation is uncertain in current products. Requirements for workflow languages are indicated through workflow <I>patterns</I>. In this context, patterns address business requirements in an imperative workflow style expression, but are removed from specific workflow languages. The paper describes a number of workflow patterns addressing what we believe identify comprehensive workflow functionality. These patterns provide the basis for an in-depth comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems. As such, this paper can be seen as the academic response to evaluations made by prestigious consulting companies. Typically, these evaluations hardly consider the workflow modeling language and routing capabilities, and focus more on the purely technical and commercial aspects.</P>},
