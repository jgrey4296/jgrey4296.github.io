The Principles of Robotics were drafted in 2010 and published online in 2011. Since then the principles have influenced, and continue to influence, a number of initiatives in robot ethics but have not, to date, been formally published. This paper remedies that omission. },

By reviewing the nature of human intelligence, this article shows that an individual's memory and ideas cannot operate directly without the human body in which they were developed. Further, there is no meaningful way in which technology can allow indefinite access to our culture. However, our lives and actions do influence the thoughts and actions of those who are living, and the Internet can enhance this influence even after our death. },

 abstract     = {This article argues that conscious attention exists not so much for selecting an immediate action as for using the current task to focus specialized learning for the action-selection mechanism(s) and predictive models on tasks and environmental contingencies likely to affect the conscious agent. It is perfectly possible to build this sort of a system into machine intelligence, but it would not be strictly necessary unless the intelligence needs to learn and is resource-bounded with respect to the rate of learning versus the rate of relevant environmental change. Support for this theory is drawn from scientific research and AI simulations. Consequences are discussed with respect to self-consciousness and ethical obligations to and for AI.

Here I address first the meaning of the document as a whole, then of its constituent parts. Further, I describe the nature of policy, and use the Principles as a case study to discuss how government and academia can interact in constructing policy. I defend the Principles and their main themes: that commercially manufactured robots should not be responsible parties under the law, and that users should not be deceived about robots' capacities or moral status. This perspective allows for the incorporation of robots immediately into UK society and law - the objective of the Principles. The Principles were not designed for every conceivable robot, but rather serve in part as design specifications for robots to be incorporated as legal products into British society. },

We show here that such legislative action would be morally unnecessary and legally troublesome. While AI legal personhood may have some emotional or economic appeal, so do many superficially desirable hazards against which the law protects us. We review the utility and history of legal fictions of personhood, discussing salient precedents where such fictions resulted in abuse or incoherence. We conclude that difficulties in holding ``electronic persons'' accountable when they violate the rights of others outweigh the highly precarious moral interests that AI legal personhood might protect.},

Consequently, the place of AI systems in society is a matter of normative, not descriptive ethics. Here I start from a functionalist assumption, that ethics is the set of behaviour that maintains a society. This assumption allows me to exploit the theoretical biology of sociality and autonomy to explain our moral intuitions. From this grounding I extend to consider possible ethics for maintaining either human- or of artefact-centred societies. I conclude that while constructing AI systems as either moral agents or patients is possible, neither is desirable. In particular, I argue that we are unlikely to construct a coherent ethics in which it it is ethical to afford AI moral subjectivity. We are therefore obliged not to build AI we are obliged to.},

 abstract     = {AlphaGo has demonstrated that a machine can learn how to do things that people spend many years of concentrated study learning, and it can rapidly learn how to do them better than any human can. Caliskan et al. now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs\textemdash for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.},

Diversity & better training data helpful, but won't fix the problem Account of bias. Inevitable result of extracting meaning from language. Can't have an algorithm that does one and not the other. Change your thinking about AI bias. Not a bug but a feature. Bias, even prejudice is what we want in some cases. Accept it, compensate for it rather than eliminating it.

 abstract     = {In this article, we present an idea for a more intuitive, low-cost, adjustable mechanism for behaviour control and management. One focus of current development in virtual agents, robotics and digital games is on increasingly complex and realistic systems that more accurately simulate intelligence found in nature. This development introduces a multitude of control parameters creating high computational costs. The resulting complexity limits the applicability of AI systems. One solution to this problem it to focus on smaller, more manageable, and flexible systems which can be simultaneously created, instantiated, and controlled. Here we introduce a biologically inspired systems-engineering approach for enriching behaviour arbitration with a low computational overhead. We focus on an easy way to control the maintenance, inhibition and alternation of high-level behaviours (goals) in cases where static priorities are undesirable. The models we consider here are biomimetic, based on neuro-cognitive research findings from dopaminic cells responsible for controlling goal switching and maintenance in the mammalian brain. The most promising model we find is applicable to selection problems with multiple conflicting goals. It utilizes a ramp function to control the execution and inhibition of behaviours more accurately than previous mechanisms, allowing an additional layer of control on existing behaviour prioritization systems.},

 abstract     = {Object manipulation is a challenging task for robotics, as the physics involved in object interaction is complex and hard to express analytically. Here we introduce a modular approach for learning a manipulation strategy from human demonstration. Firstly we record a human performing a task that requires an adaptive control strategy in different conditions, i.e. different task contexts. We then perform modular decomposition of the control strategy, using phases of the recorded actions to guide segmentation. Each module represents a part of the strategy, encoded as a pair of forward and inverse models. All modules contribute to the final control policy; their recommendations are integrated via a system of weighting based on their own estimated error in the current task context. We validate our approach by demonstrating it, both in a simulation for clarity, and on a real robot platform to demonstrate robustness and capacity to generalise. The robot task is opening bottle caps. We show that our approach can modularize an adaptive control strategy and generate appropriate motor commands for the robot to accomplish the complete task, even for novel bottles.},

 annote       = {Indirect measures must be used when analysing attitudes, as individuals are unlikely to voluntarily express beliefs that are opposed by social norms. The IAT indirectly assesses attitudes through the automatic association of concepts and attributes, however it requires strict control of extraneous influences. This paper proposes an alternative indirect measure of attitudes by designing a semantic space of the way in which words are used in language. To demonstrate the use of semantic spaces, the Enron corpus is analysed to discover whether any cultural attitudes can be observed. In the preprocessing stage, the corpus is tokenised, lemmatised and irrelevant information to semantic analysis is removed. The Enron Semantic Space is then created from the corpus, incorporating multiple features from Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Lowe and McDonald's Semantic Space (LMS). A free association test is then introduced to analyse the accuracy that the system can observe direct cognitive priming. Features from LMS and LSA are selected over HAL in the optimum implementation as they give the best accuracy of 86.86 % on the free association test. The same features are also shown to be able to observe graded and mediated priming. After, an application is presented that allows a user to create an Enron Semantic Space from scratch, and compare the differences in similarities of concepts and attributes found in the space. Using this application a numerous amount of attitude experiments are conducted. Life words are found to be associated to pleasant words and death words associated to unpleasant words. Enron is also found to be more similar to pleasant words than Dynergy. Competence words are found to be associated with youth words and incompetence words associated with elderly words. Furthermore, career words are found to be associated with male words and family words with female words. Finally, we conclude that the results support the argument towards using a semantic space to analyse attitudes, however supplementary studies need to be conducted to replicate exact experiments conducted by the IAT.},

 abstract     = {With the increasing demand for robots to assist humans in shared workspaces and environments designed for humans, research on human-robot interaction (HRI) gains more and more importance. Robots in shared environments must be safe and act in a way understandable by humans, through the way they interact and move. As visual cues such as facial expressions are important in human-human communication, research on emotion recognition, expression, and emotionally enriched communication is of great importance to HRI and has also gained increasing attention during the last two decades [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]. Most of the existing work focuses on the recognition of human emotions or mimicking their expression [1, 6] and emotional action selection [3, 5]. Less work is done on the role of emotions in influencing human behaviour in HRI [4].},

 abstract     = {Pro-social punishment, whereby cooperators punish defectors, is often suggested as a mechanism that maintains cooperation in large human groups. Importantly, models that support this idea have to date only allowed defectors to be the target of punishment. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated the existence of anti-social punishment in public goods games. That is, individuals that defect have been found to also punish cooperators. Some recent theoretical studies have found that such anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation. However, the evolution of anti-social punishment in group-structured populations has not been formally addressed. Previous work has informally argued that group-structure must favour pro-social punishment. Here we formally investigate how two demographic factors, group size and dispersal frequency, affect selection pressures on pro- and anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we find that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that anti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures, the claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation in group-structured populations should be re-evaluated.},

 abstract     = {Abstract Individuals often judge others based on third-party gossip, rather than their own experience, despite the fact that gossip is error-prone. Rather than judging others on their merits, even when such knowledge is free, we judge based on the opinions of third parties. Here we seek to understand this observation in the context of the evolution of cooperation. If individuals are being judged on noisy social reputations rather than on merit, then agents might exploit this, eroding the sustainability of cooperation. We employ a version of the Prisoner׳s Dilemma, the Donation game, which has been used to simulate the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity. First, we validate the proposition that adding homophily (the propensity to interact with others of similar beliefs) into a society increases the sustainability of cooperation. However, this creates an evolutionary conflict between the accurate signalling of ingroup status versus the veridical report of the behaviour of other agents. We find that conditions exist where signalling ingroup status outweighs honesty as the best method to ultimately spread cooperation. },

 abstract     = {When playing one-shot economic games, individuals often blindly trust others, accepting partnerships without any information regarding the trustworthiness of their partner. Consequently, they risk deleterious pacts. Oddly, when individuals do have information about another, they reject partnerships that are not fair, despite the fact that such offers are profitable---individuals costly punish. Why would one reject profitable partnerships on the one hand, but risk unknown offers on the other? Significant research has gone into explaining the contexts where blind trust or costly punishment provides an evolutionary advantage; however, both behaviours are rarely considered in tandem. Here we demonstrate that both behaviours can simultaneously be revenue maximizing. Further, given the plausible condition of partially obscured information and partner choice, trust mediates the generation of costly punishment. This result is important because it demonstrates that the evolutionary viability of trust, fairness, and costly punishment may be linked. The adaptive nature of fairness expectations can best be explained in concert with trust.},

From an evolutionary perspective, there is a tension between these two forces, because, more often than not, what is good for the individual is bad for the group, and what is good for the group is bad for the individual. In this dissertation, I argue that in order to resolve this tension between individual and group good, humans have evolved to utilise social contracts - sets of rules that structure interactions within our societies. These contracts, I argue, emerged in our hunter-gatherer ancestry as a means of solving problems surrounding their most basic and most important economic activity - food sharing. Once we became adapted to forming social contracts, we used them to solve increasingly complex social problems, leading, eventually, to our modern day economic organisation.},

The discussion section we provide (''Recalibrating the DMR Theory'') is intended to contribute not only to the DMR theory but also methodologically to the scientific application of ABM, by demonstrating good practice in model outcome communication and by validating through demonstration the model-as-theory approach." p219 Also a good discussion of what's wrong with overly-cognitive or detailed models on p. 220. e.g. "This is why the primary goal of Model 1 has been to use ABMs as a way of examining the internal consistency of our theories. In contrast, Model 2 looks at long-term dynamics, and therefore is a far simpler model of religion and agents. Both models are hybrids, which look at the dynamic functioning of features of a system both in place and over time, but each has different emphases in order to allow detailed exploration of different parts of the problem. By standard scientific practice a model/theory should only be exactly as complex as necessary to simulate/explain the phenomenon it intends to address.

 abstract     = {Autonomous robots can be difficult to design and understand. Designers have difficulty decoding the behaviour of their own robots simply by observing them. Naive users of robots similarly have difficulty deciphering robot behaviour simply through observation. In this paper we review relevant robot systems architecture, design, and transparency literature, and report on a programme of research to investigate practical approaches to improve robot transparency. We report on the investigation of real-time graphical and vocalised outputs as a means for both designers and end users to gain a better mental model of the internal state and decision making processes taking place within a robot. This approach, combined with a graphical approach to behaviour design, offers improved transparency for robot designers. We also report on studies of users' understanding, where significant improvement has been achieved using both graphical and vocalisation transparency approaches.},

It includes several significant enhancements that facilitate plan design and runtime debugging. It has been specifically designed for low power processors and has a tiny memory footprint. Written in C++, it runs efficiently on both Arduino (Atmel AVR) and Microsoft VC++ environments and has been deployed within a low cost maker robot to study AI Transparency. Plans may be authored using a variety of tools including a new visual design language, currently implemented using the Dia drawing package.},
