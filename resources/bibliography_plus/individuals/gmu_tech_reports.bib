@TechReport{panait03_cooper_multi_agent_learn_,
  abstract     = {Cooperative multi-agent systems problems are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize their utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to such problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning (ML) techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multiagent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss two important topics independent of these categories: problem decomposition and communication. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, a discussion of certain challenge topics (scalability and adaptive dynamics), and a list of multi-agent learning resources.},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent problem domains may require distributed algorithms for a variety of reasons: local sensors, limitations of communication, and availability of distributed computational resources. In the absence of these constraints, centralized algorithms are often more efficient, simply because they are able to take advantage of more information. We introduce a variant of the cooperative target observation domain which is free of such constraints. We propose two algorithms, inspired by K-means clustering and hill-climbing respectively, which are scalable in degree of decentralization. Neither algorithm consistenly outperforms the other across over all problem domain settings. Surprisingly, we find that hill-climbing is sensitive to degree of decentralization, while K-means is not. We also experiment with a combination of the two algorithms which draws strength from each.},

  abstract     = {The localization capability of a mobile robot is central to basic navigation and map building tasks. We describe a probabilistic environment model which facilitates global localization scheme by means of location recognition. In the exploration stage the environment is partitioned into a class of locations, each characterized by a set of scale-invariant keypoints. The descriptors associated with these keypoints can be robustly matched despite changes in contrast, scale and viewpoint. We demonstrate the efficacy of these features for location recognition, where given a new view the most likely location from which this view came is determined. The misclassifications due to dynamic changes in the environment or inherent appearance ambiguities are overcome by exploiting neighborhood relationships captured by a Hidden Markov Model. We report the recognition performance of this approach on an indoor environment consisting of eighteen locations and discuss the suitability of this approach for a more general class of recognition problems. Once the most likely location has been determined we show how to compute the relative pose between the representative view and the current view.},

  abstract    = {Concurrent programs exhibit non-deterministic behavior, which makes them difficult to test. One approach to testing concurrent programs, called reachability testing, generates test sequences automatically, and on-the-fly, without constructing any static models. This approach guarantees that every partially-ordered synchronization sequence of a program with a given input will be exercised exactly once. Unfortunately, in order to make this guarantee all existing reachability testing algorithms need to save and search through the history of test sequences that have already been exercised, which is impractical for many applications. In this paper, we present a new reachability testing algorithm that does not save the history of test sequences. This new algorithm guarantees that every partially-ordered synchronization sequence is exercised at least once for an arbitrary program and exactly once for a program that satisfies certain conditions. We also describe a reachability testing tool called RichTest. Our empirical studies with RichTest indicate that our new algorithm exercises every synchronization sequence exactly once for many applications.},

  abstract     = {The localization capability is central to basic navigation tasks and motivates development of various visual navigation systems. These systems can be used both as navigational aids for visually impaired or in the context of autonomous mobile systems. In this paper we describe a two stage approach for localization in indoor environments. In the first stage, the environment is partitioned into several locations, each characterized by a set of scale-invariant keypoints and their associated descriptors. In the second stage the keypoints of the query view are integrated probabilistically yielding an estimate of most likely location. The emphasis of our approach in the environment model acquisition stage is on the selection of discriminative features, best suited for characterizing individual locations. The high recognition rate is maintained with only 10 \% of the originally detected features, yielding a substantial speedup in recognition. The ambiguities due to the self-similarity and dynamic changes in the environment are resolved by exploiting spatial relationships between locations captured by Hidden Markov Model. Once the most likely location is determined, the relative pose of the camera with respect to the reference view can be computed.},

@TechReport{panait05_lenien_towar_teamm_helps_cooper_multiag_learn_,
  abstract     = {Concurrent learning is a form of cooperative multiagent learning in which each agent has an independent learning process and little or no control over its teammates' actions. In such learning algorithms, an agent's perception of the joint search space depends on the reward received by both agents, which in turn depends on the actions currently chosen by the other agents. The agents will tend to converge towards certain areas of the space because of their learning processes. As a result, an agent's perception of the search space may benefit if computed over multiple rewards at early stages of learning, but additional rewards have little impact towards the end. We thus suggest that agents should be lenient with their teammates: ignore many of the low rewards initially, and fewer rewards as learning progresses. We demonstrate the benefit of lenience in a cooperative co-evolution algorithm and in a new reinforcement learning algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In concurrent cooperative multiagent learning, each agent in a team simultaneously learns to improve the overall performance of the team, with no direct control over the actions chosen by its teammates. An agent's action selection directly influences the rewards received by all the agents; this results in a co-adaptation among the concurrent learning processes. Co-adaptation can drive the team towards suboptimal solutions because agents tend to select those actions that are rewarded better, without any consideration for how such actions may affect the search of their teammates. We argue that to counter this tendency, agents should also prefer actions that inform their teammates about the structure of the joint search space in order to help them choose from among various action options. We analyze this approach in a cooperative coevolutionary framework, and we propose a new algorithm, oCCEA, that highlights the advantages of selecting informative actions. We show that oCCEA generally outperforms other cooperative coevolution algorithms on our test problems.},

@TechReport{zhang05_nonpar_,
  abstract     = {In many computer vision problems, several instances of a particular model need to be recovered from the noisy data. In such cases one is faced with the problem of simultaneous estimation of the number of models and their parameters. This problem becomes difficult as the measurement noise in the data increases and the data are further corrupted by outliers. This is especially the case in a variety of motion estimation problems, where the displacement between the views is large and the process of establishing correspondences is difficult. In this paper we propose a novel nonparametric sampling based method for solving this problem. The main novelty of the proposed method lies in the analysis of the distribution of residuals of individual data points with respect to the set of hypotheses, generated by a RANSAC-like sampling process. We will show that the modes of the residual distributions directly reveal the presence of multiple models and facilitate the recovery of the individual models, without making any assumptions about the distribution of the outliers or the noise process. The proposed approach is capable of handling data with large fraction of outliers. Experiments with both synthetic and real data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

@TechReport{zhang05_,
  abstract     = {The data in vision problems, often heavily contaminated by outliers, call for efficient robust techniques to identify inliers for correct estimation. RANSAC algorithm is a frequently used robust estimator for computer vision problems. In traditional RANSAC scheme, when data contain significant fraction of outliers, large number of samples is needed in order to obtain at least one outlier free sample. In addition to that, each hypothesis generated from the samples is typically evaluated using all data points, which further lowers the efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hypothesis evaluation scheme, which enables efficient classification of the data points as outliers and inliers, while requiring a small fixed number of samples. The method is based on the observation that for each data point the properties of the distribution of the residuals with respect to the generated hypotheses reveal whether the point is an outlier or inlier. The problem of inlier/outlier identification can then be formulated as a classification problem. We demonstrate the proposed method on motion estimation problems with large fraction of outliers on both synthetic and real data.},

Unlike other architectures that address this problem, this architecture, which we call blind custodians, does not rely on encryption. Instead, it offers confidentiality by means of information dissociation: The server only stores "fragments" of information that are considered safe (i.e., each fragment does not violate privacy), while the client stores the associations between the fragments that are necessary to reconstruct the information. We argue that this architecture allows satisfactory confidentiality, while offering two important advantages: (1) It does not restrict the types of queries that can be submitted by clients (as encryption-based methods invariably do), and (2) it requires only light processing at the client, assigning the bulk of the processing to the server (as befits a true service). Moreover, the architecture permits flexible control over the level of confidentiality that should be maintained (at the cost of additional overhead).},

By assembling intermediate products, the target product can be manufactured in a variety of processes, each modeled by a tree. We are interested in manufacturing turnaround: the time between receiving an order at the root and its completion. We express the turnaround time of each manufacturing process (tree) with a formula that incorporates three parameters: the time required to create elementary components, the time required to assemble a product from its components and the time required to deliver the product to its procurer (another manufacturer). We show that this turnaround formula is optimized in a manufacturing process that corresponds to a perfect (or nearly perfect) tree. The degree of the optimal tree (i.e., the ideal number of components in each sub-assembly) is shown to be independent of the number of elementary components, suggesting that in each manufacturing environment there is an ideal assembly size, which is optimal for the manufacturing of products of any scale.},

  abstract     = {A vital part of a modern economy is an information market. In this market, information products are being traded in countless ways. Information is bought, modified, integrated, incorporated into other products, and then sold again. Often, the manufacturing of an information product requires the collaboration of several participants. A virtual enterprise is a community of business entities that collaborate on the manufacturing of complex products. This collaboration is often ad hoc, for a specific product only, after which the virtual enterprise may dismantle. The virtual enterprise paradigm is particularly appealing for modeling collaborations for manufacturing information products, and in this paper we present a new model, called VirtuE, for modeling such activities. VirtuE has three principal components. First, it defines a distributed infrastructure with concepts such as members, products, inventories, and production plans. Second, it defines transactions among members, to enable collaborative production of complex products. Finally, it provides means for the instrumentation of enterprises, to measure their performance and to govern their behavior.},

@TechReport{brodsky05_cojav_,
  abstract     = {We have proposed and implemented the language CoJava, which offers both the advantages of simulation-like process modeling in Java, and the capabilities of true decision optimization. By design, the suntax of CoJava is identical to the programming language Java, extended with special constructs to (1) make a non-deterministic choice of a numeric value, (2) assert a constraint, and (3) designate a program variable as the objective to be optimized. The semantics of CoJava interprets a program as an optimal nondeterministic execution path, namely, a path that (1) satisfies the range conditions in the choice statements, (2) satisfies the assert-constraint statements, and (3) produces the optimal value in a designated program variable, among all execution paths that satisfy (1) and (2). To run a CoJava program amounts to first finding an optimal execution path, and then procedurally executing it. We have developed a CoJava constraint compiler based on a reduction of the problem of finding an optimal execution trace to a standard symbolic formulation, reinterpreting Java code as a symbolic constraint construction, and solving the resulting optimization problem on an external solver. To demonstrate the power of CoJava, we have implemented a realistic problem in the area of robot arm control in CoJava. The robot arm is constructed using self-contained components implemented as CoJava classes, that model robot's arm movements based on Newton's laws.},

@TechReport{barbara06_detec_,
  abstract     = {Finding points that are outliers with respect to a set of other points is an important task in data mining. Outlier detection can uncover important anomalies in fields like intrusion detection and fraud analysis. In data streaming, the presence of a large number of outliers indicates that the underlying process that is generating the data is undergoing significant changes and the models that attempt to characterize it need to be updated. Although there has been a significant amount of work in outlier detection, most of the algorithms in the literature resort to a particular definition of what an outlier is (e.g., density-based), and use thresholds to detect them. In this paper we present a novel technique to detect outliers that does not impose any particular definition for them. The test we propose aims to diagnose whether a given point is an outlier with respect to an existing clustering model (i.e., a set of points partitioned in groups). However, the test can also be successfully utilize to recognize outliers when the clustering information is not available. This test is based on Transductive Confidence Machines, which have been previously proposed as a mechanism to provide individual confidence measures on classification decisions. The test uses hypothesis testing to prove or disprove whether a point is fit to be in each of the clusters of the model. We demonstrate, experimentally, that the test is highly robust, and produces very few misdiagnosed points, even when no clustering information is available. We also show that the test can be succesfully applied to identify outliers present inside a data set for which no other information is available, thereby provinding the user with a clean data set to identify future outliers. Our experiments also show that even if the data set used to identify further outliers is contaminated with some outliers, the test can perform succesfully.},

  abstract     = {In text mining we often have to handle large document collections. The labeling of such large corpuses of documents is too expensive and impractical. Thus, there is a need to develop (unsupervised) clustering techniques for text data, where the distributions of words can vary significantly from one category to another. The vector space model of documents easily leads to a 30000 or more dimensions. In such high dimensionality, the effectiveness of any distance function that equally uses all input features is severely compromised. Furthermore, it is expected that different words may have different degrees of relevance for a given category of documents, and a single word may have a different importance across different categories. In this paper we first propose a global unsupervised feature selection approach for text, based on frequent itemset mining. As a result, each document is represented as a set of words that co-occur frequently in the given corpus of documents. We then introduce a locally adaptive clustering algorithm, designed to estimate (local) word relevance and, simultaneously, to group the documents. We present experimental results to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Furthermore, the analysis of the weights credited to terms provide evidence that the identified keywords can guide the process of label assignment to clusters. We take into consideration both spam email filtering and general classification datasets. Our analysis of the distribution of weights in the two cases provides insights on how the spam problem distinguishes from the general classification case.},

In this paper we address the problem of optimizing the kernel function using pairwise constraints for semi-supervised clustering. To this end we derive a new optimization criterion to automatically estimate the optimal parameters of composite Gaussian kernels, directly from the data and the given constraints. We combine the optimal kernel function computed by our technique with a recently introduced semi-supervised kernel-based algorithm to demonstrate experimentally the effectivess of our approach.

In this paper we describe Grid-VirtuE, a three-layer architecture for grid virtual enterprises.

This layer is supported by middleware infrastructure for grids, providing a host of grid services, such as node-to-node communication, bilateral transactions, and data collection. The bottom layer is essentially a distributed data warehouse for storing, sharing and analyzing the large amounts of data generated by the grid. Among other functionalities, the warehouse handles the dissemination of data among the members of the grid; it confronts issues of data magnitude with an aging mechanism that aggregates old data at a lower level of detail; and it incorporates privacy-preserving features that retain the confidentiality of individual members.

This paper considers the approaches belonging to the K-means family, in particular those based on fuzzy memberships. When patterns are represented by means of non-metric pairwise dissimilarities, these methods cannot be directly applied, since they are not guaranteed to converge. Symmetrization and shift operations have been proposed, to transform the dissimilarities between patterns from non-metric to metric. It has been shown that they modify the K-means objective function by a constant, that does not influence the optimization procedure. Some fuzzy clustering algorithms have been extended, in order to handle patterns described by means of pairwise dissimilarities. The literature, however, lacks of an explicit analysis on what happens to K-means style fuzzy clustering algorithms, when the dissimilarities are transformed to let them become metric. This paper shows how the objective functions of four clustering algorithms based on fuzzy memberships change, due to dissimilarities transformations.

We set the new problem in the architecture of a canonical multidatabase system, using it in the "reverse direction".

However its realization has thus far been elusive. Existing approaches involve many disparate concepts, frameworks and technologies. What is needed is a comprehensive and overarching framework that handles the processing and workflow requirements of Virtual Enterprises, maps them to a collection of service-oriented tasks, dynamically configures these tasks from available services, and manages the choreography and execution of these services. The goal is to add semantics to Web services to endow them with capabilities currently lacking in the literature, but necessary for their successful deployment in future systems. This paper introduces such a framework, called the Knowledge-based Dynamic Semantic Web Services (KDSWS) Framework, that addresses in an integrated end-to-end manner, the life-cycle of activities involved in preparing, publishing, requesting, discovering, selecting, configuring, deploying, and delivering Semantic Web Services. In particular, the following issues are addressed: 1) semantic specification of services capabilities including quality of service, trust, and security; 2) transaction control and workflow management; and 3) resource management, interoperation and evolution of the Virtual Enterprise. Two models and their associated languages are introduced to specify the features for these enhanced services: 1) the KDSWS Meta-Model, and 2) the KDSWS Process Language. Both are based on the Knowledge/Data Model. This integrated and comprehensive approach provides a unified end-to-end approach to enable dynamically-composable, semantically-rich, service-oriented systems of Web services.},

The previous method models the behavior of a single class as a finite state machine, transforms that representation into a data flow graph that explicitly identifies the definitions and uses of each state variable of the class, and then applies conventional data flow testing to produce test case specifications that can be used to test the class. This paper extends those ideas to inter-class testing by developing flow graphs and tests for an arbitrary number of classes and components. It introduces flexible representations for message sending and receiving among objects and allows concurrency among any or all classes and components. A second major result is the introduction of a novel approach to performing data flow analysis. Data flow graphs are stored in a relational database, and database queries are used to gather def-use information. This approach is conceptually simple, mathematically precise, quite powerful, and general enough to be used for traditional data flow analysis. This testing approach relies on finite state machines, database modeling and processing techniques, and algorithms for analysis and traversal of directed graphs. A proof-of-concept implementation is used to illustrate how the approach works on an extended example.},

Our protocol is scalable since every node only needs to possess a small number of keys, independent of the network size, and it is computationally efficient because it only relies on symmetric key operations. We show that a pairwise key established between two nodes using our protocol is secure against a collusive attack by a certain number of compromised nodes, and that our protocol can be parameterized to meet the appropriate levels of performance, security and storage for the application under consideration.},

@TechReport{anokhin03_fusion_,
  abstract     = {Fusionplex is a system for integrating multiple heterogeneous and autonomous information sources, that uses data fusion to resolve factual inconsistencies among the individual sources. To accomplish this, the system relies on source features, which are meta-data on the quality of each information source; for example, the recentness of the data, its accuracy, its availability, or its cost. The fusion process is controlled with several parameters: (1) With a vector of feature weights, each user defines an individual notion of data utility; (2) with thresholds of acceptance, users ensure minimal performance of their data, excluding from the fusion process data that are too old, too costly, or lacking in authority, or data that are too high, too low, or obvious outliers; and, ultimately, (3) in naming a particular fusion function to be used for each attribute (for example, average, maximum, or simply any) users implement their own interpretation of fusion. Several simple extensions to SQL are all that is needed to allow users to state these resolution parameters, thus ensuring that the system is easy to use. Altogether, Fusionplex provides its users with powerful and flexible, yet simple, control over the fusion process. In addition, Fusionplex supports other critical integration requirements, such as information source heterogeneity, dynamic evolution of the information environment, quick ad-hoc integration, and intermittent source availability.

These features are combined in a flexible utility function that expresses the overall value of a data item to the user. Utility allows us to (1) define meaningful ranking on the inconsistent set of answers, and offer the top-ranked answer as a preferred answer; (2) determine whether a fusion value is indeed better than the initial values, by calculating its utility and comparing it to the utilities of the initial values; and (3) discover the best fusion: the fusion formula that optimizes the utility.

Sequences of queries may also reflect attempts to circumvent retrieval restrictions, where users attempt to approximate information which is inaccessible, with sequences of legitimate requests (in the latter case, our explanations may lead database owners to either tighten access, or, conversely, to reorganize their interfaces to facilitate access). Because the true objective of a sequence may be clouded by the retrieval of spurious records, our approach considers all the possible aggregates that a user may accumulate with a sequence, and to rank them, search-engine style, according to their plausibility as retrieval objectives. Our method is probabilistic in nature and postulates that the likelihood that a set of records is the true objective of the user is inverse proportional to the likelihood that this set results from random selection.

Recently, it has been recognized that a ``yes/no'' response to every scenario is just not enough for many modern systems and applications.

To address this need, this paper introduces the notions of provisions and obligations. Provisions are those conditions that need to be satisfied or actions that must be performed before a decision is rendered, while obligations are those conditions or actions that must be fulfilled by either the users or the system after the decision. This paper formalizes a rule-based policy framework that includes provisions and obligations, and investigates a reasoning mechanism within this framework. A policy decision may be supported by more than one derivation, each associated with a potentially different set of provisions and obligations (called a global PO set). The reasoning mechanism can derive all the global PO sets for each specific policy decision, and facilitates the selection of the best one based on numerical weights assigned to provisions and obligations as well as on semantic relationships among them. The paper also shows the use of the proposed policy framework in a security application and discusses through an example various aspects of how the system may compensate unfulfilled obligations.},

Such methods are intended to automate, at least in part, the laborious process of information integration, by which existing data sources are incorporated in a virtual database. Essentially, these methods scan new data sources, attempting to discover possible mappings to the virtual database. Like all discovery processes, this process is intrinsically probabilistic; that is, each discovery is associated with a specific value that denotes assurance of its appropriateness. Consequently, the rows in a discovered virtual table have mixed assurance levels, with some rows being more credible than others. In this paper we argue that rows in discovered virtual databases should be ranked, and we describe a ranking method, called TupleRank, for calculating such a ranking order. Roughly speaking, TupleRank calibrates the probabilities calculated during a discovery process with historical information about the performance of the system.

Using logical key trees reduces the complexity of group rekeying operation from O(N) to O(log N), where N is the group size. In this paper, we present two optimizations for logical key tree organizations that utilize information about the characteristics of group members to further reduce the overhead of group rekeying. First, we propose a partitioned key tree organization that exploits the temporal patterns of group member joins and departures to reduce the overhead of rekeying. Using an analytic model, we show that our optimization can achieve up to 31.4 \% reduction in key server bandwidth overhead over the un-optimized scheme. Second, we propose an approach under which the key tree is organized based on the loss probabilities of group members. Our analysis shows this optimization can reduce the rekeying overhead by up to 12.1 \%.},

The cost of maintenance for conventional software can account for as much as two-thirds of the total cost, and it is likely to be more for component-based software. Thus, an effective maintenance technique for component-based software is strongly desired. This paper presents a UML-based technique that attempts to help resolve difficulties introduced by the implementation transparent characteristics of component-based software systems. This technique can also be useful for other maintenance activities. For corrective maintenance activities, the technique starts with UML diagrams that represent changes to a component, and uses them to support regression testing. To accommodate this approach for perfective maintenance activities, more challenges are encountered.

  abstract     = {The Internet is quietly becoming the body of the business world, with web applications as the brains. This means that software faults in web applications have potentially disastrous consequences. Most work on web applications has been on making them more powerful, but relatively little has been done to ensure their quality. Important quality attributes for web applications include reliability, availability, interoperability and security. Web applications share some characteristics of client-server, distributed, and traditional programs, however there are a number of novel aspects of web applications. These include the fact that web applications are ``dynamic'', due to factors such as the frequent changes of the application requirement as well as dramatic changes of the web technologies, the fact that the roles of the clients and servers change dynamically, the heterogeneity of the hardware and software components, the extremely loose coupling and dynamic integration, and the ability of the user to directly affect the control of execution. In this paper, we first analyze the distinct features of web-based applications, and then define a generic analysis model that characterizes the typical behaviors of web-based applications independently of different technologies. Based on this analysis, a family of testing techniques is discussed to ensure different level of quality control of web applications under various situations.},

To thwart or prevent such attacks, it is necessary to employ authentication mechanisms that ensure that only authorized nodes can inject traffic into the network. In this paper, we present LHAP, a scalable and light-weight authentication protocol for ad hoc networks. LHAP is based on two techniques: (i) hop-by-hop authentication for verifying the authenticity of all the packets transmitted in the network and (ii) one-way key chain and TESLA for packet authentication and for reducing the overhead for establishing trust among nodes. We analyze the security properties of LHAP. Furthermore, our performance analysis shows that LHAP is a very lightweight security protocol.},

This result is significant at the 99.99 \% level, and no additional variables are needed to explain this increase. On the other hand, the number of lines of code in each kernel modules grows only linearly with version number. We conclude that, unless Linux is restructured with a bare minimum of common coupling, the dependencies induced by common coupling will, at some future date, make Linux exceedingly hard to maintain without inducing regression faults.},

In this paper we describe a system, called Automatch, that uses machine learning techniques to automate schema matching. Based primarily on Bayesian learning, the system acquires probabilistic knowledge from examples that have been provided by domain experts. This knowledge is stored in a knowledge base called the attribute dictionary. When presented with a pair of new schemas that need to be matched (and their corresponding database instances), Automatch uses the attribute dictionary to find an optimal matching.

Formal specifications represent a significant opportunity for testing because they precisely describe what functions the software is supposed to provide in a form that can be easily manipulated by automated means. This Phase III, 1999 report presents results from an empirical evaluation of the full predicate specification-based testing criterion developed during the first two phases of this project, and a proof-of-concept test data generation tool. The evaluation used a comparative study on a large industrial system, a research version of the Flight Guidance Mode Logic System (FGS) provided by Rockwell Collins. Full predicate tests were generated for FGS, and compared against the T-Vec generation scheme. T-Vec tests for FGS were also provided by Rockwell Collins. While creating and running the tests, one problem was found in the SCR specifications for FGS, and one problem was found in the already well tested implementation of FGS. Both T-Vec and the full predicate tests found almost the same number of faults, but T-Vec required more than five times as many tests, thus the full predicate tests were more efficient. The proof-of-concept test data generator creates full predicate and transition-pair tests from an SCR specification. Currently, the tool requires the SCR specification to be a single mode transition table, all variables must be boolean, and the transition predicates must be single-variable expressions.},

Formal specifications represent a significant opportunity for testing because they precisely describe what functions the software is supposed to provide in a form that can be easily manipulated by automated means. This Phase II, 1998 report presents results and strategies for practically applying test cases generated according to the criteria presented in the Phase I, 1997 report. This report presents a small empirical evaluation of the test criteria, and algorithms for solving various problems that arise when applying test cases developed from requirements/specifications. One significant problem in specification-based test data generation is that of reaching the proper program state necessary to execute a particular test case. Given a test case that must start in a particular state S, the test case prefix is a sequence of inputs that will put the software into state S. We have addressed this problem in two ways. First is to combine various test cases to be run in test sequences that are ordered in such a way that each test case leaves the software in the state necessary to run the subsequent test case. An algorithm is presented that attempts to find test case sequences that are optimal in the sense that the fewest possible number of test cases are used. To handle situations where it is desired to run each test case independently, an algorithm for directly deriving test sequences is presented. This report also presents procedures for removing redundant test case values, and develops the idea of ``sequence-pair'' testing, which was presented in the 1997 Phase I report, into a more general idea of ``interaction-pair'' testing.},

A major problem for developers in an evolutionary environment is that seemingly small changes can ripple throughout the system to cause major unintended impacts elsewhere. As such, software developers need mechanisms to understand how a change to a software system will impact the rest of the system. Although the effects of changes in object-oriented software can be restricted, they are also more subtle and more difficult to detect. Maintaining the current object-oriented systems is more of an art, similar to where we were 15 years ago with procedural systems, than an engineering skill. We are beginning to see ``legacy'' object-oriented systems in industry. A difficult problem is how to maintain these objects in large, complex systems. Although objects are more easily identified and packaged, features such as encapsulation, inheritance, aggregation, polymorphism and dynamic binding can make the ripple effects of object-oriented systems far more difficult to control than in procedural systems. The research presented here addresses the problems of change impact analysis for object-oriented software. Major results of this research include a set of object-oriented data dependency graphs, a set of algorithms that allow software developers to evaluate proposed changes on object-oriented software, a set of object-oriented change impact metrics to evaluate the change impact quantitatively, and a prototype tool, ChaT, to evaluate the algorithms. This research also results in efficient regression testing by helping testers decide what classes and methods need to be retested, and in supporting cost estimation and schedule planning.},

In addition, the ability to create quick, ad-hoc virtual databases for short-lived applications is now considered attractive. Under these new assumptions, a single, complete answer can no longer be guaranteed. It is now possible that a query could not be answered in its entirety, or it might result in several different answers. Multiplex is a multidatabase system designed to operate under these new assumptions. In this paper we describe how Multiplex handles queries that do not have a single, complete answer. The general approach is to define flexible and comprehensive strategies that direct the behavior of the query processing subsystem.

In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm, based in the fractal properties of the datasets. The new algorithm, which we call Fractal Clustering (FC) places points incrementally in the cluster for which the change in the fractal dimension after adding the point is the least. This is a very natural way of clustering points, since points in the same cluster have a great degree of self-similarity among them (and much less self-similarity with respect to points in other clusters). FC requires one scan of the data, is suspendable at will, providing the best answer possible at that point, and is incremental. We show via experiments that FC effectively deals with large datasets, high-dimensionality and noise and is capable of recognizing clusters of arbitrary shape.},

Input validation testing chooses test data that attempt to show the presence or absence of specific faults pertaining to input tolerance. A large amount of syntax-directed software currently exists and will continue to be developed that should be subjected to input validation testing. System level testing techniques that currently address this area are not well developed or formalized. There is a lack of system level testing formal research and accordingly a lack of formal, standard criteria, general purpose techniques, and tools. Systems are large (size and domain) so unit testing techniques have had limited applicability. Input validation testing techniques have not been developed or automated to assist in static input syntax evaluation and test case generation. This paper addresses the problem of statically analyzing input command syntax as defined in interface and requirements specifications and then generating test cases for input validation testing. The IVT (Input Validation Testing) technique has been developed, a proof-of-concept tool (MICASA) has been implemented, and validation has been performed. Empirical validation on actual industrial software (for the Tomahawk Cruise Missile) shows that as compared with senior, experienced testers, MICASA found more requirement specification defects, generated test cases with higher syntactic coverage, and found additional defects. Additionally, the tool performed at significantly less cost.},

@TechReport{barbara98_quasi_cubes_,
  abstract     = {A data cube is a popular organization for summary data. A cube is simply a multidimensional structure that contains at each point an aggregate value, i.e., the result of applying an aggregate function to an underlying relation. In practical situations, cubes can require a large amount of storage. The typical approach to reducing storage cost is to materialize parts of the cube on demand. Unfortunately, this lazy evaluation can be a time-consuming operation. In this paper, we propose an approximation technique that reduces the storage cost of the cube without incurring the run time cost of lazy evaluation. The idea is to characterize regions of the cube by using statistical models whose description take less space than the data itself. Then, the model parameters can be used to estimate the cube cells with a certain level of accuracy. To increase the accuracy, some of the ``outliers,'' i.e., cells that incur in the largest errors when estimated can be retained. The storage taken by the model parameters and the retained cells, of course, should take a fraction of the space of the full cube and the estimation procedure should be faster than computing the data from the underlying relations. We study three methods for modeling cube regions: linear regression, singular value decomposition and the independence approach. We study the tradeoff between the amount of storage used for the description and the accuracy of the estimation. Experiments show that the errors introduced by the estimation are small even when the description is substantially smaller than the full cube. Since cubes are used to support data analysis and analysts are rarely interested in the precise values of the aggregates (but rather in trends), providing approximate answers is, in most cases, a satisfactory compromise. Our technique allows systems to handle very large cubes that cannot either be fully stored or efficiently materialized on demand. Even for applications that can only accept tiny error in the cube data, our techniques can be used to present successive on-line refinements of the answer to a query so that a coarse picture of the answer can be presented while the remainder of the answer is fetched from disk (i.e., to support on-line aggregation).},

The discovery process usually starts with a user-specified skeleton, called an ``event structure'', which consists of a number of variables representing events and temporal constraints among these variables; and the goal of the discovery is to find temporal patterns, i.e., instantiations of the variables in the structure, which frequently appear in the time sequence. This paper introduces event structures that have temporal constraints with multiple granularities, defines the pattern discovery problem with these structures, and studies effective algorithms to solve it. The basic components of the algorithms include timed automata with granularities (TAGs) and a number of heuristics. The TAGs are for testing whether a specific temporal pattern, called a ``candidate complex event type'', appears frequently in a time sequence. Since there are often a huge number of candidate event types for a usual event structure, heuristics are presented aiming at reducing the number of candidate event types and reducing the time spent by the TAGs to test whether a candidate type does appear frequently in the sequence. These heuristics exploit the information provided by explicit and implicit temporal constraints with granularity in the given event structure. The paper also gives the results of an experiment to show the effectiveness of the heuristics on a real data set.},

  abstract     = {Constraints provide a flexible and uniform way to conceptually represent diverse data capturing spatio-temporal behavior, complex modeling requirements, partial and incomplete information etc, and have been used in a wide variety of application domains. Constraint databases have recently emerged to deeply integrate data captured by constraints in databases. This paper reports on the development of the first constraint object-oriented database system, Ccube, and describes its specification, design and implementation. The Ccube system is designed to be used for both implementation and optimization of high-level constraint object-oriented query languages such as LyriC or constraint extensions of OQL, and for directly building software systems requiring extensible use of constraint database features. The Ccube data manipulation language, Constraint Comprehension Calculus, is an integration constraint calculus for extensible constraint domains within monoid comprehensions, which serve as an optimization-level language for object-oriented queries. The data model for constraint calculus is based on constraint spatio-temporal (CST) objects that may hold spatial, temporal or constraint data, conceptually represented by constraints. New CST objects are constructed, manipulated and queried by means of constraint calculus. The model for monoid comprehensions, in turn, is based on the notion of monoids, which is a generalization of collection and aggregation types to structures over which one can iterate and apply merge operator; this includes disjunctions and conjunctions of constraints. The focal point of our work is achieving the right balance between expressiveness, complexity and representation usefulness, without which the practical use of the system would not be possible. To that end, C3 constraint calculus guarantees polynomial time data complexity, and, furthermore, is tightly integrated with monoid comprehensions to allow deep global optimization.},

The MLR model builds upon prior work of numerous authors in this area, and integrates ideas from a number of sources. The new {\em data-based} semantics is given to the MLR data model which combines ideas from SeaView, belief-based semantics and LDV model, and has the advantages of both eliminating ambiguity and retaining upward information flow. The model is simple, unambiguous and powerful. It has five integrity properties and five operation statements for manipulating multilevel relations. In order to support this integration, several new concepts are introduced and many old ones are redefined. A central contribution of this paper is proofs of soundness, completeness and security of the MLR data model. These proofs respectively show that any of the provided operation statements can keep database state legal (i.e., satisfying all integrity properties), every legal database state can be constructed, and the MLR data model is non-interfering. This is the first time that such properties have been formally proved for a multilevel relational data model.

For this study, we identified types of faults that are common to C++ software and inserted faults of these types into two C++ programs. Test cases generated using the category-partition method were used to test the programs. A fault was considered detected if it caused the program to terminate abnormally or if the output was different from the output of the original program. The results show that the combination of the category-partition method and a tool for detecting memory management faults may be effective for testing C++ programs in general.

Multiplex is based on formal assumptions of integrability, which distinguish between scheme and instance reconcilability among independent databases. Multiplex supports database heterogeneity, and it provides several degrees of freedom that allow it to model actual situations encountered in multidatabase applications. In addition, in situations in which a single answer is not obtainable (either because the global query is not answerable, or there are multiple candidate answers), Multiplex defines approximative answers. Finally, Multiplex provides a practical platform for implementation. A prototype of such an implementation is described briefly.},

  abstract     = {In several recent works a common scenario is described: a relational database scheme R and a set of views V of this scheme are defined, and queries on the database scheme R must be transformed to equivalent queries on the views V. Given a query Q on R, the first problem is whether there exists a query Q_V expressed exclusively on V which is equivalent to Q, and, if it exists, how to find it. Clearly, an equivalent Q_V may not always exist. In such a case, it is important to approximate Q as best as possible with a query on V. The problems here are to define approximations, to determine whether a best approximation exists, whether it is unique, and how to find it. In this paper we formalize and answer these questions. Specifically, we show that the following problems are decidable for a conjunctive query Q and a set of conjunctive views V: (1) is there a conjunctive query Q_V on V that is equivalent to Q, and (2) is there a union Q_U of conjunctive queries on V that is equivalent to Q? Furthermore, we show that Q_V and Q_U are effectively computable if they exist. Moreover, the greatest lower bound of Q exists and is unique up to equivalence. This is done by introducing lower bound classifications, and proving their existence, finiteness and effective computability. This problem has many interesting applications, including physical database design (aimed at optimization of query processing), cooperative answering (where answers are annotated with some of their properties), and multidatabase query decomposition. We examine these applications, and we show how our work extends earlier results obtained in these applications.},

  abstract     = {Temporal data explicitly stored in a temporal database are often associated with certain semantic assumptions. Each assumption can be viewed as a way of deriving implicit information from the explicitly stored data. Rather than leaving the task of deriving (possibly infinite) implicit data to application programs, as is the case currently, it is desirable that this be handled by the database management systems. To achieve this, this paper formalizes and studies two types of semantic assumptions: point-based and interval-based. The point-based assumptions include those assumptions that use interpolation methods, while the interval-based assumptions include those that involve different temporal types (time granularities). In order to incorporate semantic assumptions into query evaluation, this paper introduces a translation procedure that converts a user query into a system query such that the answer of this system query over the explicit data is the same as that of the user query over the explicit AND the implicit data. The paper also investigates the finiteness (safety) of user queries and system queries.},

A decomposition generates a set of proof obligations that must be satisfied to show that a particular decomposition correctly models the original collection of transactions. We introduce the notion of semantic histories to formulate and prove the necessary properties.

In this preliminary paper, we explore the fundamental nature of faults by looking at the differences between a syntactic and semantic characterization of faults. We offer definitions of these characteristics and explore the differentiation. Specifically, we discuss the concept of ``size'' of program faults --- the measurement of size provides interesting and useful distinctions between the syntactic and semantic characterization of faults. We use the fault size observations to make several predictions about testing and present data that supports this model. We also use the model to offer explanations about several questions that have intrigued testing researchers.},

  abstract     = {The concurrency control requirements for transaction processing in a multilevel secure file system are different from those in conventional transaction processing systems; in particular, there is the need to coordinate transactions at different security levels avoiding both potential timing covert channels and the starvation of transactions at high security levels. Suppose a transaction at a low security level attempts to write a data item that is being read by a transaction at a higher security level. On the one hand, a timing covert channel arises if the transaction at the low security level is either delayed or aborted by the scheduler. On the other hand, the transaction at the high security level may be subjected to an indefinite delay if it is forced to abort repeatedly. This paper extends the two-phase locking mechanism that is suitable for conventional transaction processing systems, to multilevel secure data management systems. The scheme presented here, avoids the abort of higher level transactions, nonetheless guaranteeing serializability. The system programmer is provided with a powerful set of linguistic constructs which supports exception handling, partial rollback and forward recovery. The proper use of these constructs can prevent the indefinite delay in completion of a high level transaction, and allows the system programmer to trade off starvation with transaction isolation.},

This external model is based on an internal model which resembles a semantic network. Such a network may be extracted from a variety of data models, including object-oriented, entity-relationship and extended relational models. This architecture gives ViewFinder a large degree of model independence. The main construct of the external model are displays of objects (either classes or tokens), called views. Commands are available for efficient traversal of the database, displaying views of any class or token. To speed up repetitive searches, views may be synchronized: the user sets up several views, linked in a tree-like structure, so that when the information displayed in the root view is modified (e.g., scrolled by the user), the contents of the other views change automatically. Additional commands are available to search, order, aggregate and select the information displayed in a view, thus providing a simple query facility.},

This result indicates that it suffices to allow testing for only two cells of the matrix. In this paper we study the relationship between TRM and the Unary Transformation Model (UTRM). In UTRM, individual commands are restricted to testing for only one cell of the matrix (whereas individual TRM commands can test for multiple cells of the matrix). Contrary to our initial conjecture, we found, quite surprisingly, that TRM and UTRM are formally equivalent in terms of expressive power. The implications of this result on safety analysis is also discussed in this paper.

In a multidimensional temporal module, every non-temporal fact has a timestamp that is a set of n-ary tuples of time points. A temporal module has a set of timestamped facts and has an associated temporal granularity (or temporal type), and a temporal database is a set of multidimensional temporal modules with possibly different temporal types. Temporal algebras are proposed on this database model. Example queries and results of the paper show that the algebras are rather expressive. The operations of the algebras are organized into two groups: snapshot-wise operations and timestamp operations. Snapshot-wise operations are extensions of the traditional relational algebra operations, while timestamp operations are extensions of first-order mappings from timestamps to timestamps. Multiple temporal types are only dealt with by these timestamp operations. Hierarchies of algebras are defined in terms of the dimensions of the temporal modules in the intermediate results. The symbol \(Talg_k^{m,n}\) is used to denote all the algebra queries whose input, output and intermediate modules are of dimensions at most m, n and k, respectively. (Most temporal algebras proposed in the literature are in \(Talg_1^{1,1}\).) Equivalent hierarchies \(Tcalc_k^{m,n}\) are defined in a calculus query language that is formulated by using a first-order logic with linear order. The addition of aggregation functions into the algebras is also studied.},

  abstract     = {Although there are many techniques and tools available to support the software testing process, one of the most crucial parts of testing, generating the test data, is usually done by hand. Test data generation is one of the most technically challenging steps in testing software, but unfortunately, most practical systems do not incorporate any automation in this step. This paper presents a new method for automatically generating test data that incorporates ideas from symbolic evaluation, constraint-based testing, and dynamic test data generation. It takes an initial set of values for each input, and ``pushes'' the values through the control-flow graph of the program in a dynamic way, modifying the sets of values as branches in the program are taken. This method is an outgrowth of previous research in constraint-based testing, and combines several of the steps that were previously separate into one coherent process. The major difference is that this method is dynamic, and resolves path constraints immediately; it also includes an intelligent search technique, and improved handling of arrays, loops, and pointers.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of good database logical design is to eliminate data redundancy and insertion and deletion anomalies. In order to achieve this objective for temporal databases, the notions of temporal types and temporal functional dependencies (TFDs) are introduced. A temporal type is a monotonic mapping from ticks of time (represented by positive integers) to time sets (represented by subsets of reals) and is used to capture various standard and user-defined calendars. A TFD is a proper extension of the traditional functional dependency and takes the form X-u->Y, meaning that there is a unique value for Y during one tick of the temporal type u for one particular X value. An axiomatization for TFDs is given. Since a finite set of TFDs usually implies an infinite number of TFDs, we introduce the notion of and give an axiomatization for a finite closure to effectively capture a finite set of implied TFDs that are essential to the logical design. Temporal normalization procedures with respect to TFDs are then given. More specifically, temporal Boyce-Codd normal form (TBCNF) that eliminates all data redundancies, and temporal third normal form (T3NF) that allows dependency preservation, are defined. Both normal forms are proper extensions of their traditional counterparts, BCNF and 3NF. Decomposition algorithms are presented that give lossless TBCNF decompositions and lossless, dependency preserving, T3NF decompositions.},

The proposed LyriC language is motivated by application realms such as (1) constraint-based design in two-, three-, or higher-dimensional space, (2) large-scale optimization and analysis, based mostly on linear programming techniques, and (3) spatial and geographic databases. LyriC is an extension of flat constraint query languages, and especially those for linear constraint databases, to complex objects. The extension is based on the object-oriented paradigm, where a database is a collection of objects some of whose attributes might be either described explicitly or implicitly by constraints. Constraints are organized in classes with associated methods. The query language is an extension of the language XSQL, suggested by Kifer, Kim and Sagiv, and is built around the idea of extended path expressions. Path expressions in a query traverse nested structures in one sweep. Constraints are used in a query to filter stored constraints and to create new constraint objects.},

  abstract     = {In an active database, an update may be constrained by integrity constraints, and may also trigger rules that, in turn, may affect the database state. The general problem is to effect the update while also managing the ``side-effects'' of constraint enforcement and rule execution. In this paper an update calculus is proposed by which updates, constraints and rules are specified and managed within the same formalism. Constraints and production rules are expressed in a constraint language based on first-order logic. These logic expressions are used to semantically transform an original update into a sequence of updates that reflect the relevant constraints and production rules. The inference mechanism associated with processing a reformulated query ensures that: 1) the pre- and post-conditions of an update are satisfied, 2) update side-effects are propagated, and 3) repairs are made to tuples exhibiting constraint violations. Thus, a user-specified ``update'' is transformed, through semantic reformulation techniques, into a sequence of updates which together ensure semantic integrity of the original update as well as its propagated side-effects. This research presents several contributions. Integrity constraints and production rules are expressed in a declarative formalism so that they may be reasoned about. The update calculus formalism handles the semantic reformulation of an update to reflect relevant constraints and rules governing it. Finally, an algorithm is presented to handle constraint enforcement, production rule firing, and subsequent repair actions.},

For the first comparison, we define a coverage measure that is used for the comparison. The coverage of data flow by mutation is between 99 \% and 100 \%, which means that test data that satisfied the mutation criterion also satisfied the data flow criterion in almost all cases. The coverage of mutation by data flow was between 80 and 90 \%. For the second comparison, we use test data that satisfy the two criteria to detect faults, and compare the criteria on the basis of the faults found.

With this procedure, we suggest a heuristic for choosing a minimal coverage of the categories identified in the test specifications, suggest parts of the process that can be automated, and offer a solution to the problem of identifying infeasible combinations of test case values. Our method uses formal schema-based functional specifications and is illustrated with an example of a simple file system. We conclude that our approach eases test case creation and leads to effective tests of software.

And when information sources overlap, it is practically unavoidable that information would be inconsistent; that is, describe differently the same portion of the real world. In this report we define a formal framework for resolving extensional inconsistencies that are detected in the process of processing queries against a collection of information sources. This framework establishes basic database concepts, such as schemes, instances, views, queries and integrity constraints, as well as new concepts, such as view equivalence, scheme mappings, multi-databases, multi-database queries and inconsistency. Altogether, it provides the formal foundations necessary for addressing issues of information integration and inconsistency resolution. Our approach to the integration of inconsistent answers is based on information goodness, a measure for estimating the proximity of stored information to the ideal information. We propose to maintain for each information source a goodness base: a set of basic views whose goodness will be useful for inferring the goodness of anticipated queries. When a query is answered inconsistently by individual information sources we propose to (1) estimate the goodness of each answer from the appropriate goodness base, and (2) integrate the individual answers in an answer of the highest goodness. We sketch the architecture of a software agent, called Harmony, that will implement our approach.},

The compiled constraints incorporate the semantics associated with inheritance over generalization hierarchies and references to simple objects which are constituents of complex objects. These clauses are evaluated and enforced whenever an attribute value is retrieved or updated. The update semantics for update propagation of object instances is embedded in the compiled constraints; constraints therefore play a role similar to methods in the model, but are specified explicitly rather than procedurally.

The goal is to identify a minimum number of threads in the problem environment that drive the system while operating on objects. ELM states that threads are primarily those processes that must be rescheduled at particular points in time and those that vie for resources. The intent of this paper is to show that the ELM approach to problem analysis needs to be modified in order to produce optimal designs in a message passing environment. The paper suggests that some reschedulable processes do not need their own threads of control. Instead, the desired effect can be achieved by timers that insert a message into the message queue of a given process at the appropriate time.

@TechReport{sanden92_subjec_objec_,
  abstract     = {This paper proposes subject-object modeling as a new design approach for reactive software. Subject-object modeling combines the strength of the existing object and process paradigms of computation. Each paradigms stress the close relationship between the structure of the software and the structure of the problem. The object paradigm sees the world in terms of objects sending messages to each other, while the process paradigm sees it in terms of communicating sequential processes. With both paradigms, the structure of the software can be directly patterned on the structure of the problem environment, providing a seamless transition from analysis to design. The problem with the object paradigm is that it does not handle timing well. Some object-oriented authors play down the timing aspect and regard the operations on objects as ``shopping lists'' to be picked from in any order. But timing is essential in many systems and particularly in reactive software. The process paradigm captures time dependencies, but forces the user to regard even trivial objects in process terms, which is often cumbersome and counter-intuitive. Subject-object modeling enhances the object paradigm with a means to express time relationships beyond the scope of any one object and enhances the process paradigm with object decomposition as a means for information hiding and for the handling of simple objects. The analyst's goal is a compelling description of the problem domain based on processes operating on objects, where the processes capture the timing and ordering of operations on objects. Such a problem description is useful in its own right. It can also be mapped directly onto a software design. In an Ada environment, processes map onto tasks and the objects become packages (or instances of abstract data types.) In this paper, the subject-object approach is applied to a problem with free-floating buoys and an elevator control problem. The solution to the buoy problem is compared to an earlier-published object-based solution.},

We focus on an extension, {\it leximin fairness}, which breaks ties among candidate policies by choosing the one which maximizes the second-to-minimum average reward, then the third-to-minimum average reward, and so on. This method has a number of advantages over others in the literature, but has so far been little-used because of the computational cost in employing it to find the fairest policy. In this paper we propose a linear programming based algorithm for computing leximin fairness in repeated games which has a polynomial time complexity given certain reasonable assumptions.},

  abstract     = {One promising technique for defending software systems against vulnerabilities involves the use of self-healing. Such efforts, however, carry a great deal of risk because they largely bypass the cycle of human-driven patching and testing used to vet both vendor and internally developed patches. In particular, it is difficult to predict if a repair will keep the behavior of the system consistent with "normal" behavior. Assuring that post-repair behavior does not deviate from normal behavior is a major challenge to which no satisfactory solutions exist. We investigate the feasibility of automatically measuring behavioral deviations in software that has undergone a self-healing repair. We provide a first examination of the problem of assessing a repair's impact on execution behavior, and we define a model for representing post-repair behavior using machine-level intraprocedural control flow. In essence, we advocate performing anomaly detection on an application's execution {\em after} it has been attacked and subsequently repaired. Our goal, however, is not to detect an attack, but rather to provide a tool for assisting a system administrator to perform vulnerability triage. Our system can help them discover the relative impact of a repair so that they can begin to track down and analyze the cause of post-repair execution anomalies.},

Security researchers embraced virtual machine monitors (VMMs) as a new mechanism to guarantee deep isolation of untrusted software components. Unfortunately, their widespread adoption promoted VMMs as a prime target for attackers. In this paper, we present HyperCheck, a hardware-assisted tampering detection framework designed to protect the integrity of VMMs and, for some classes of attacks, the underlying operating system (OS). HyperCheck leverages the CPU System Managed Mode (SMM), present in x86 systems, to securely generate and transmit the full state of the protected machine to an external server. Using HyperCheck, we were able to ferret-out rootkits that targeted the integrity of both the Xen hypervisor and traditional OSes. Moreover, HyperCheck is robust against attacks that aim to disable or block its operation. Our experimental results show that Hypercheck can produce and communicate a scan of the state of the protected software in less than 40ms.},

As such, characterizing and understanding their roles is crucial for improving human health and the environment. The problem of using short reads obtained from current next generation sequencing technologies to assemble the genomes within the community sample is challenging for several reasons. In this study we assess the performance of a state-of-the-art Eulerian-based graph assembler on a series of simulated dataset with varying complexity. We evaluate the feasibility of metagenomic assembly with reads restricted to be 36 base pairs obtained from the Solexa/Illumina platform. We developed a pipeline to evaluate the quality of assembly based on contig length statistics and accuracy. We studied the effect of overlap parameters used for the metagenomic assembly and developed a clustering solution to pool the contigs obtained from different runs of the assembly algorithm which allowed us to obtain longer contigs. We also computed an entropy/impurity metric to assess how mixed the assembled contigs were. Ideally a contig should be assembled from reads obtained from the same organism. We also compared the metagenomic assemblies to the best possible solution that could be obtained by assembling individual source genomes. Our results show that accuracy was better than expected for the metagenomic samples with a few dominant organisms and was especially poor in samples containing many closely related strains.},

Classification algorithms often center around the notion of a distance metric between examples. Unlike sequences, the Euclidean distance metric between vectors often has an intuitive meaning which transfers naturally to a meaning in the classification domain. Distances metrics between arbitrary pairs of sequences, however, can be harder to define because sequences can vary in both length and the information contained in the order of sequence elements is lost when standard distance metrics are applied. We present a scheme that employs a Hidden Markov Model variant to produce a set of fixed-length vectors from a set of sequences. We then define three inference algorithms, a Baum-Welch variant, a Gibbs Sampling algorithm, and a variational algorithm, to infer model parameters. Finally, we show experimentally that the fixed length representation produced by these inference methods is useful for classifying proteins by structural taxonomy.},

For example, in social networks, an individual is expected to belong to multiple clusters (or communities), rather than strictly confining himself/herself to just one. As such, overlapping clusters enable better models of real-life phenomena. Soft clustering (e.g., fuzzy c-means) has been used with success for non-graph data, when the objects are allowed to belong to multiple clusters with a certain degree of membership. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy clustering based approach for community detection in a weighted graphical representation of social and biological networks, for which the ground truth associated to the nodes is available.

Although the social networks themselves are usually well-provisioned, the participating users frequently point to external links to substantiate their discussions. Unfortunately, the sudden heavy traffic load imposed on the external, linked web sites causes them to become unresponsive leading to what people call the ``Flash Crowds'' effect. Flash Crowds present a real challenge, as it is not possible to predict their intensity and occurrence time. Moreover, although increasingly capable, most present-day web hosting servers and caching systems are designed to handle a nominal load of requests before they become unresponsive. This can happen either due to the limited bandwidth or processing power allocated to the hosting site. In this paper, we quantify the prevalence of flash crowd events for a popular social discussion board (Digg). Using PlanetLab, we measured the response times of 1289 unique popular websites. We were able to verify that 89\% of the popular URLs suffered variations in their response times. In an effort to identify flash crowds ahead of time, we evaluate and compare traffic forecasting mechanisms. We show that predicting network traffic using network measurements has very limited success and cannot be used for large-scale prediction. However, by analyzing the content and structure of the social discussions, we were able to classify 86\% of the popular web sites within 5 minutes of their submission and 95\% of the sites when more (5 hours) of social content became available. Our work indicates that we can effectively leverage social activity to forecast network events that will be otherwise infeasible to anticipate.},

@techreport{smutz10_rumin_,
  abstract     = { Traditionally, Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) inspect packet header and payload data for malicious content. While each system is different, most NIDS perform limited analysis on network streams and network protocols. Unfortunately, current NIDS are typically susceptible to evasion through network protocol encoding, such as base64 encoding of SMTP/MIME or gzip compression of HTTP. In addition, malicious desktop application payloads (e.g., PDF documents, Flash multimedia files) are beyond the inspection capabilities of popular NIDS. To address these limitations, we introduce Ruminate, a scalable object-centric traffic inspection and analysis architecture. Ruminate provides a distributed platform for deep analysis of network payload content. This includes full decoding of network protocols and recursive extraction of client application objects transferred over the network. While traditional NIDS utilize static packet load balancing to provide scalability, Ruminate employs dynamic load distribution of reassembled network streams and embedded objects, outsourcing the heavy processing to other processors or connected hosts. Therefore, high latency or computationally expensive analysis can be performed on commodity servers. Furthermore, our approach empowers system administrators to provision resources and preferentially treat traffic not only depending on the packet header but also on the data objects it carries. To achieve this, each object inspection algorithm is implemented as a separate component or service offered through a highly scalable producer-consumer architecture. We demonstrate using real-world traffic that our load balancing is far superior to existing techniques. This is because its granularity depends on the reconstructed objects rather than packet or simple stream analysis. Unlike existing systems, Ruminate can prevent NIDS evasion that leverages encoding or compression of malicious objects in network protocols, desktop application file formats, or encapsulation within other objects.},

In this paper, we develop a parallel sequence assembler implemented on general purpose graphic processor units (GPUs). Our work was largely motivated by a growing need in the genomic community for sequence assemblers and increasing use of GPUs for general purpose computing applications. We investigated the implementation challenges, and possible solutions for a data parallel approach for sequence assembly. We implemented an Eulerian-based sequence assembler (GPU-Euler) on the nVidia GPUs using the CUDA programming interface. GPU-Euler was benchmarked on three bacterial genomes using input reads representing the new generation of sequencing approaches. Our empirical evaluation showed that GPU-Euler produced lower run times, and showed comparable performance in terms of contig length statistics to other serial assemblers. We were able to demonstrate the promise of using GPUs for genome assembly, a computationally intensive task.},

Choices made early on are both difficult and costly to change, and thus it is paramount that the engineer gets them 'right'. This leads to a paradox, as in early design, the engineer is often forced to make these decisions under uncertainty, i.e., not knowing the precise impact of those decisions on the various concerns. How could the engineer make the 'right' choices in such circumstances? This is precisely the question we have tackled in this paper.

A large volume of geometric models describing urban objects has become freely available in the public domain via software like ArcGlobe and Google Earth. Although mostly created for visualization, these urban models can benefit many applications beyond visualization including city scale evacuation planning and earth phenomenon simulations. However, these models are mostly loosely structured and implicitly defined and require tedious manual preparation that usually takes weeks if not months before they can be used. Designing algorithms that can robustly and efficiently handle unstructured urban models at the city scale becomes a main technical challenge. In this paper, we present a framework that generates seamless 3D architectural models from 2D ground plans with elevation and height information. These overlapping ground plans are commonly used in the current GIS software such as ESRI ArcGIS and urban model synthesis methods to depict various components of buildings. Due to measurement and manual errors, these ground plans usually contain small, sharp, and various (nearly) degenerate artifacts. In this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically that our framework is efficient and numerically stable. Based on our review of the related work, we believe this is the first work that attempts to automatically create 3D architectural meshes for simulation at the city level. With the goal of providing greater benefit beyond visualization from this large volume of urban models, our initial results are encouraging.},

This makes attractive the notion of learning from demonstration, whereby a robot learns behaviors in real time from the examples of a demonstrator. Learning from demonstration can be problematic, however, because of the number of trials necessary to gather sufficient samples to learn correctly. The problem is compounded in a multi-robot setting due to the potentially much larger design space arising from the number of and interactions between the robots. In this paper, we propose a learning from demonstration system capable of rapidly training multiple robots to perform a collaborative task. Our supervised learning method applies user domain knowledge to decompose complex behaviors into a hierarchy of simpler behaviors, which are easier to train and learn, and require many fewer samples to do so. The system further reduces the state space by only considering environmental features and actions pertinent to each decomposed simple behavior. Decomposition occurs not only within individual robot behaviors but also at the hierarchical group behavior level. Experiments using Pioneer robots in a patrol scenario illustrate our system.},

  abstract     = { Exfiltration of data using internet-borne attacks has become a credible threat for organization and enterprises. History has shown that crafted targeted attacks and zero-day malware are capable of penetrating even the most sophisticated defenses. To make matters worse, intrusion detection systems that perform analysis of network traffic are dependent on the timely information provided by blacklisting, signature schemes, or anomaly patterns. This is especially true for heavily used communication protocols where blocking decisions affect the everyday operations of the organization. Even when the intrusion is detected in a timely manner, valuable data might have already been stolen. In this paper, we propose a new approach to distinguish legitimate browser software from malware that generates identical network traffic signatures. Our system consists of two parts: a signature-based passive detection module, and a module that issues Program Interactive Challenges (PICs) to client applications. Initially, we perform passive detection utilizing content inspection techniques that analyze network header element order. Of course this is not enough: we demonstrate that passive detection can be easily subverted. To amend that, we introduce an interactive detection module in the form of inline network proxy that challenges the detected browser forcing it to exercise known specific internal functionality. For browsers, we can leverage HTML, Flash, Javascript and other common browser components to form challenges that malware will not be able to respond to due to lack of functionality. Contrary to interractive challenges, our challenges are transparent to the user allowing for a seamless browsing experience. We demonstrate the effectiveness of active challenges on thousands of real world malware samples. Our results show that, depending on the deployment scenario, PICs incure no or minimal (average of 0.35 seconds) latency per inspected objected.},

To make matters worse, the overall system security depends on desktop applications with complex code-bases that perform multiple and inter-dependent tasks often dictated by Internet-borne code. Recent research has indicated the need for context-dependent trustworthy environments where the user can segregate different activities in an effort to lower risk and safeguard private information. In this paper, we introduce a new BIOS-assisted mechanism for the secure generation and management of trusted execution environments, tailored to separate security-sensitive activities from untrusted ones. A key characteristic of our system is usability: the capability to quickly and securely switch between operating environments in a single physical machine without the need for any specialized hardware or extensive code modifications. Our goal was to eliminate any mutable, non-BIOS codesharing while reusing existing processor capabilities. We demonstrate that even if the untrusted OS becomes compromised, it cannot perform an exfiltration or inference attack on data or applications in the trusted OS. To avoid sophisticated attacks that fake a trusted environment, we provide visible indication to the user about the current environment. Moreover, to alternate between environments, we require the user to physically press a button, an action that cannot be reproduced by software. Using our prototype, we measured the switching process to be approximately six seconds. This short switching time empowers the user to frequently and seamlessly switch between trusted and untrusted environments.},

Researchers and practitioners have claimed that any unauthorized state modification can be detected with an SMM-based system integrity-checking mechanism. In this paper, we demonstrate that all hardware-based, periodic integrity mechanisms can be defeated by a new class of attacks, which we refer to as ``evasion attacks.'' Such attacks use a compromised software stack to remove any attack traces before the integrity checks begin and to continue the execution of the malicious code after the integrity checks are completed. We detail two categories of evasion attacks: directly-intercepting System Management Interrupt (SMI) and indirectly-deriving SMI invocations. Finally, we measure the performance impact of our proof-of-concept prototypes for all of the attacks and present countermeasures for these attacks.},

This paper presents a complementary technique that solves this problem in settings where such models are either not available, difficult to build, or outdated due to the evolution of the software. Our approach first mines the execution history of a software system to infer a "stochastic component dependency model", representing the probabilistic sequence of interactions among the system's components.

Surprisingly, we also discovered that by artificially reducing the influence of the top features we can achieve robust detection even in an adversarial setting where the attacker is aware of the top features and our normality model.

In the proposed approach we exploit the features providing evidence about widely available non-object categories (such as sky, road, buildings) and use informative features which are indicative of the presence of object boundaries to gather the evidence about objects. We formulate the object/non-object semantic segmentation problem in the Conditional Random Field Framework, where the structure of the graph is induced by the minimum spanning tree computed over 3D reconstruction, yielding an efficient algorithm for an exact inference. We carry out extensive experiments on videos of urban environments acquired by a moving vehicle and compare our approach to existing alternatives.},

  abstract     = { Model-based testers design tests in terms of models, such as paths in graphs. Abstract tests cannot be run directly because they use names and events that exist in the model, but not the implementation. Testers usually solve this mapping problem by hand. Model elements often appear in many abstract tests, so testers write the same redundant code many times. This is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone. This paper presents a language to automate the creation of mappings from abstract tests to concrete tests. Three issues are addressed: (1) creating mappings and generating test values, (2) transforming graphs and using coverage criteria to generate test paths, and (3) solving constraints and generating concrete test. The paper also presents results from an empirical comparison of testers using the mapping language with manual mapping on 17 open source and example programs. We found that the automated test generation method took a fraction of the time the manual method took, and the manual tests contained numerous errors in which concrete tests did not match their abstract tests.},

In other words, the paper combines methods used in discrete event simulation for the characterization of job arrivals with efficient analytic methods to model contention for resources in a computer system. The Epochs algorithm was validated against experimental results using jobs derived from a micro-benchmark and real jobs. The validation shows that the absolute relative error between measurements and execution time predictions obtained with the Epochs algorithm is below 10\% in most cases and is at most 15\%.},

This paper presents a trace-driven analytic model (TDAM) method that can be used to assess the impact of different schedulers on job execution times. The TDAM approach uses an implementation of the scheduler to generate job traces that are fed into analytic models of the computers in the cluster. These analytic models use closed queuing network methods to estimate congestion at the various nodes of the cluster. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the TDAM method by showing how four different types of schedulers affect the execution times of jobs derived from well-known benchmarks.

This paper considers manufacturing processes that involve physical or virtual inventories of products, parts and materials, that move from machine to machine. The inventory levels vary with time and are a function of the configuration settings of the machines involved in the process. These environments require analysis, e.g., answering what-if questions, and optimization to determine optimal operating settings for the entire process. The modeling complexities in performing these tasks are not always within the grasp of production engineers. To address this problem, the paper proposes the temporal Manufacturing Query Language (tMQL) that allows the composition of modular process models for what-if analysis and decision optimization queries. tQML supports an extensible and reusable model knowledge base against which declarative queries can be posed. Additionally, the paper describes the steps to translate the components of a tMQL model to input data files used by a commercial optimization solver.},

However, optimization modeling used for decision optimization presents two major challenges. First, it requires expertise in operation research and mathematical programming, which most users, including software developers, engineers, business analysts and end-users, typically do not have. Second, optimization models are usually highly customized, not modular, and not extensible. Sustainable Process Analytics Formalism (SPAF) has been recently proposed at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to address these challenges, by transitioning from the redevelopment of optimization solutions from scratch towards maintaining an extensible library of analytical models, against which declarative optimization queries can be asked. However, the development of practical algorithms and a system for SPAF presents a number of technical challenges, which have not been addressed. In this paper we (1) propose an object-oriented extension of SPAF, named Optimization Analytics Language (OAL); (2) present OAL system development based on methods to reduce OAL models and queries into a formal mathematical programming formulation; (3) showcase OAL through a simple case study in the domain of manufacturing; and (4) conduct a preliminary experimental study to assess the overhead introduced by OAL.},

Most current approaches seek to detect the malicious attributes of documents whether through signature matching, dynamic analysis, or machine learning. We take a different approach: we perform transformations on documents that render exploits inoperable while maintaining the visual interpretation of the document intact. Our exploit mitigation techniques are similar in effect to address space layout randomization, but we implement them through permutations to the document layout. Using document content layout randomization, we randomize the data block layout of Microsoft OLE files in a manner similar to the inverse of a file system defragmention tool. This relocates malicious payloads in both the original document file and in the memory of the reader program. We demonstrate that our approach indeed subdues in the wild exploits by manual validation of both Office 2003 and Office 2007 malicious documents while the transformed documents continue to render benign content properly. The document transformation can be performed offline and requires only a single document scan while the user-perceived delay when opening the transformed document is negligible. We also show that it is possible to thwart malicious heap sprays by injecting benign content in documents. This approach, however, comes at an expense of computational and memory resources.},

Many methods make strong assumptions about symmetric task relationships while some are able to utilize externally provided task relationships. However, in many real world tasks the degree of relatedness among tasks is not known a priori. Methods which are able to extract the task relationships and exploit them while simultaneously learning models with good generalization performance can address this limitation. In the current work, we have extended a recently proposed method for learning task relationships using smooth squared loss for regression to classification problems using non-smooth hinge loss due to the demonstrated effectiveness of SVM classifier in single task classification settings. We have also developed an efficient optimization procedure using bundle methods for the proposed multi-task learning formulation. We have validated our method on one simulated and two real world datasets and have compared its performance to competitive baseline single-task and multi-task methods.},

While access to resources can be controlled by the Android permission system, enforcing permissions is not sufficient to prevent security violations, as permissions may be mismanaged, intentionally or unintentionally. Android's enforcement of the permissions is at the level of individual apps, allowing multiple malicious apps to collude and combine their permissions or to trick vulnerable apps to perform actions on their behalf that are beyond their individual privileges. In this paper, we present COVERT, a tool for compositional analysis of Android inter-app vulnerabilities. COVERT's analysis is modular to enable incremental analysis of applications as they are installed, updated, and removed. It statically analyzes the reverse engineered source code of each individual app, and extracts relevant security specifications in a format suitable for formal verification. Given a collection of specifications extracted in this way, a formal analysis engine (e.g., model checker) is then used to verify whether it is safe for a combination of applications --- holding certain permissions and potentially interacting with each other --- to be installed together. Our experience with using COVERT to examine over 200 real-world apps corroborates its ability to find inter-app vulnerabilities in bundles of some of the most popular apps on the market.},

Rigid origami is usually used as the underlying model for the self-folding machines whose surface remains rigid during folding except at joints. A key issue in designing rigid origami is foldability that concerns about finding folding steps from a flat sheet of crease pattern to a desired folded state. Although recent computational methods allow rapid simulation of folding process of certain rigid origamis, these methods can fail even when the input crease pattern is extremely simple. In this paper, we take on the challenge of planning folding and unfolding motion of origami tessellations, which are composed of repetitive crease patterns. The number of crease lines of a tessellation is usually large, thus searching in such high dimensional configuration space with the requirement of maintaining origami rigidity is nontrivial. We propose a motion planner that takes symmetry into consideration and reuses folding path found on the essential crease pattern. Both of these strategies enable us to fold large origami tessellation much more efficiently than the existing methods. Our experimental results show that the proposed method successfully folds several types of rigid origami tessellations that the existing methods fail to fold.},

In this paper, we investigate an approach that decomposes a mesh P based on the identification of convex ridges. Intuitively, convex ridges are the protruding parts of the mesh P. Our method, called CORISE, extracts nearly convex components of P by separating each convex ridge from all the other convex ridges. Through the new concept of residual concavity CORISE requires only a single user parameter: concavity tolerance. We show that our method can generate noticeably better segmentation in significant shorter time than the current state-of-art methods.

This paper presents an approach that allows the end-users to safeguard a given bundle of apps installed on their device from such attacks. The approach, realized in a tool, called DroidGuard, combines static code analysis with lightweight formal methods to automatically infer security-relevant properties from a bundle of apps. It then uses a constraint solver to synthesize possible security exploits, from which fine-grained security policies are derived and automatically enforced to protect a given device.

  abstract     = { Proposed in this paper is an extensible decision support system framework to facilitate Commercial and Industrial entities forming a consortium to collaborate on their electric power supply and demand in order to streamline their consumption and reduce their costs. The collaborative framework includes the structure of market setting, participants' bids, and a market resolution which produces a schedule of how power components are controlled as well as the resulting payment by market participants. We also define four properties that the market resolution must satisfy, namely, feasibility, Pareto-optimality, Nash equilibrium, and equal collaboration profitability. Furthermore, we develop a market resolution algorithm, based on a formal optimization model and prove that it satisfies the desirable market properties.},

@TechReport{joshua15_obfus_resil_effic_accur_detec_,
  abstract     = {The number of Android malware apps are increasing very quickly. Simply detecting and removing malware apps is insufficient, since they can damage or alter other files, data, or settings; install additional applications; etc. To determine such behavior, a security engineer can significantly benefit from identifying the specific family to which an Android malware belongs. Techniques for detecting Android malware, and determining their families, lack the ability to deal with obfuscations (i.e., transformations of application to thwart detection). Moreover, some of the prior techniques are highly inefficient, making them inapplicable for real-time detection of threats. To address these limitations, we present a novel machine learning-based Android malware detection and family identification approach, RevealDroid, that provides selectable features. We assess RevealDroid to determine a selection of features that enable obfuscation resiliency, efficiency, and accuracy for detection and family identification. We assess RevealDroid's accuracy and obfuscation resilience on an updated dataset of malware from a diverse set of families, including malware obfuscated using various transformations, and compare RevealDroid against an existing Android malware-family identification approach and another Android malware detection approach.},

  abstract     = { Machine learning classifiers are a crucial component of modern malware and intrusion detection systems. However, past studies have shown that classifier-based detection systems are susceptible to evasion attacks in practice. Improving the evasion resistance of learning based systems is an open problem. In this paper, we analyze the effects of mimicry attacks on real-world classifiers. To counter such attacks, we introduce a novel approach that not only exposes attempts to evade the classifier, but also evaluates the ability of the system to operate reliably. We advance mutual agreement analysis for ensemble classifiers: during the detection operation, when a sufficient number of votes from individual classifiers disagree, the ensemble classifier prediction is shown to be unreliable. This method allows the detection of classifier evasion without additional external information. To evaluate our approach, we used thousands of both malicious and benign PDF documents. Applying our method to two recent evasion attack studies, we show that most evasion scenarios are detected. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be generalized to weaken the effectiveness of the Gradient Descent and Kernel Density Estimation attacks against Support Vector Machines (SVM) by creating an ensemble classifier using many base SVMs. We discovered that feature bagging is the most important property for enabling mutual agreement based evasion detection.},

  abstract     = { Software as a Service (SaaS) allows companies and individuals to use software, hosted and managed by a SaaS provider, on a pay-per-use basis instead of paying for the entire upfront, maintenance, and upgrade cost. SaaS providers can lease their computing infrastructure to instantiate VMs that run their software services from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers on a pay per use basis. SaaS customers can subscribe to and unsubscribe from a software service at anytime. Thus, the SaaS cloud provider should dynamically determine the number of needed VMs to run software services as a function of the demand in a way that minimizes the SaaS cost of using VMs from an IaaS but at the same time guaranteeing an agreed upon Quality of Service (QoS) to the SaaS customers. This report presents two heuristic techniques that can be used by SaaS providers to determine the type and quantity of VMs to be leased in order to best satisfy customer demands for software services. Our experiments showed that the number of states visited by the proposed method is very low (on the order of $10^{-4}$ of the entire space) while the solution obtained is 2 \% more expensive in most cases, 13 \% more expensive in a few cases, and 31 \% more expensive in only one case, when compared with the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on developing an approach and technology for actionable recommendations on the operation of components of an electric power network. The overall direction of this research is to model the major components of a Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES), including power generation, transmission/distribution, power storage, energy markets, and end customer demand (residential and commercial). First, we propose a conceptual diagram notation for power network topology, to allow the representation of an arbitrary complex power system. Second, we develop a formal mathematical model that describes the HRES optimization framework, consisting of the different network components, their respective costs, and associated constraints. Third, we implement the HRES optimization problem solution through a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by leveraging IBM Optimization Programming Language (OPL) CPLEX Studio. Lastly, we demonstrate the model through an example of a simulated network, showing also the ability to support sensitivity / what-if analysis, to determine the behavior of the network under different configurations.},

This paper proposes the Decision Guidance Analytics Language (DGAL) for easy iterative development of decision guidance systems. DGAL allows the creation of modular, reusable and composable models that are stored in the analytical knowledge base independently of the tasks and tools that use them. Based on these unified models, DGAL supports declarative queries of (1) data manipulation and computation, (2) what-if prediction analysis, (3) deterministic and stochastic decision optimization, and (4) machine learning, all through formal reduction to specialized models and tools, and in the presence of uncertainty.}

  abstract     = {Software architecture recovery plays an increasingly important role in the evolution, maintenance, and run-time self-adaptation of modern software systems whose architecture may have become outdated or may not have previously existed. However, current approaches to architecture recovery take a centralized approach, in which the process is carried out from a single location. This proves inadequate in the case of large distributed systems which, due to size, consist of nodes that are disparately located and are highly dynamic in nature. This report presents DeSARM, a completely decentralized and automated approach for software architecture recovery of distributed systems based on gossiping and message tracing. Through message tracing, the technique is able to identify important architectural characteristics such as components and connectors, in addition to synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns. Furthermore, through its use of gossiping, it exhibits the properties of scalability, global consistency among participating nodes, self-organization, and resiliency to failures. The report discusses DeSARM's architecture and detailed design and demonstrates its properties through an analysis of small and large-scale experiments.},
