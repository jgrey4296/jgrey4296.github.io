This is a graduate seminar on the economic, legal, and strategic aspects of
technical compatibility standards.  It is open to all graduate students who
feel prepared for it. <p>

The readings may seem frightening in their volume and diversity.  Be assured,
however, that they are fairly redundant.  The phenomena of standards are
so strange that most authors feel the need to explain the basics to each
audience.  We will be able to gloss over much of that background material.
<p>


Week 1 / Introduction <p>

<blockquote>
This week we'll go through the syllabus and introduce everyone.
</blockquote>

Week 2 / Background <p>

<blockquote>
Reading the literature on standards is like diving to the bottom of the
ocean: it's a different world, so complicated that the authors have no
choice but to simplify away a great deal.  Accordingly, we will prepare
ourselves by reading about various big pictures into which the standards
literature ought to fit.

<blockquote>
Many people are familiar with standards issues mostly through the publicity
surrounding the Internet.  Viewed in historical context of other technical
standards, the Internet is quite atypical, and an important question is
whether the Internet standardization process is the wave of the future,
or whether it is an anomaly.  Drake's article, really a review of Carl
Malamud's "Exploring the Internet", raises the issue in vivid and colorful
terms.

in Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics, Cambridge: Cambridge

<blockquote>
The various sectors of the economy do not evolve through independent paths
of technological innovation.  Quite the contrary, innovation in one area
of the economy frequently spills over into other areas.  Rosenberg provides
numerous examples.  This will be a useful perspective to keep in mind when
we consider case studies of standardization that are confined to particular
industries.

information technology standards, considered as an interconnected family,
and the overall process through which they evolved.  By keeping the
particulars of this story in mind, we will be able to test many of the
theories of standardization that will appear in later weeks' readings.

argues, these standards are usefully viewed as a component of a society's

Technologies do not arise at random, but through a theme-and-variations
pattern that is not driven solely by the demands of a market considered
in abstraction.  Dosi provides some ways of thinking about the coherent
"paradigms" of technology and their subsequent evolution.  This will be
a useful perspective when we consider models of standardization that reduce
technologies to binary choices between one discrete standard and another.

<blockquote>
Some standards are more successful than others.  Success can be measured
in terms of a standard's widespread acceptance or rejection by markets
and governments.  But it can also be measured in other terms, for example
its ability to evolve and to interact with later, unpredicted innovations.
Hanseth et al describe how this need for flexibility has been addressed in
the Internet.

<blockquote>It matters whether a standard arises, but it also matters which standard
arises, because standards, and thus artifacts themselves, can embody
socially meaningful biases.  Friedman and Nissenbaum provide a taxonomy
of the ways in which computer systems can be biased.  This perspective
will be nearly invisible through most of the literature that we read this
term, so we should try to keep Friedman and Nissenbaum's analysis in mind
throughout.

Week 3 / Networks <p>

<blockquote>
The most important single word this term is "network".  Unfortunately, this
word carries about five different meanings: (1) a set of machines connected
to one another by standard communications protocols; (2) the presumptively
homogenous group of individuals who have all bought a given product, and
who benefit from one another's use of the product; (3) the presumptively
heterogeneous set of products and services that must all be available and
working if any one of them is to be enjoyed successfully; (4) a collection
of business firms joined together by a shifting set of alliances; and
(5) the network of individual human relationships through which familiarity
with a new technology diffuses.  This week we will read about the first
four of these, all of which will figure in later discussions.  For business
thinking about the fifth and its implications for strategy, see Moore's
"Crossing the Chasm".

<blockquote>
According to the actor network school of technology studies, technological
innovation is essentially a matter of assembling heterogeneous networks of
interdependent artifacts, people, organizations, laws, and so forth.  Callon
provides a highly abstract vocabulary for talking about these networks and
their evolution.

As industrial products and production processes become more complicated, it
becomes impractical for any one firm to command the full range of necessary
skills.  As a result, many analysts argue that the global economy evolving
into a complex and ceaselessly shifting network of alliances among firms.
Grabher's chapter is the introduction to an edited volume of articles on
this phenomenon, and it surveys various analyses of it.

This article is often cited as the origin of network economics.  It offers
a formal analysis of the observation that the value of a telecommunications

mass phenomena and other such effects, which have come to become called
network effects.

Week 4 / Compatibility <p>

<blockquote>
Standards come in several varieties, but we are concerned principally with
compatibility standards -- the ones that ensure that products work together
as they're supposed to.  Compatibility standards are important for numerous
reasons, perhaps the most important being that they seem path-dependent:
once a given compatibility standard becomes widely adopted, it is difficult
for everyone to switch to a new standard because new equipment needs to be
compatible with old equipment.  The nature and limits of this phenomenon is
perhaps the central topic of the course.

<blockquote>
"Interoperability", a word from the Internet world, appears to mean roughly
the same thing as "interconnection", a word from the telecommunications
world.  The juxtaposition of these two words points to a larger collision
of technical, strategic, and regulatory worlds.  Bar et al outline various
aspects of this collision, and their article (a classic already at three
years of age) previews themes that will be developed more fully in later
readings.

Amidst all of the optimism about the Internet, introduced by Drake above,

not sustainable.  In particular, they argue that both its architecture and
its institutional structures will necessarily evolve back toward the bad old
telecommunications models.

market configurations.

This is a widely cited early analysis of the interaction between the
economic properties of standards and choices about vertical integration,

point is that antitrust's suspicion of vertical integration should be
tempered by its potential efficiencies in a standards-driven market.

Week 5 / Organizations <p>

<blockquote>
Most people think of standards as documents that are issued by formal
standards organizations such as ISO, ANSI, and the IETF.  But the world
is changing, and the nature and role of these organizations is changing
as well.  We will consider the inherent economic tensions that underlie
cooperative standards activities, the interaction of various players'
strategies, the tensions that standards organizations experience as these
strategies change, and various potential responses.  This week's reading
also includes several case studies, all of which are recommended rather
than required reading.

public policy, IEEE Standards Bearer 9(2), 1995, pages 1, 10. <p>

<blockquote>
This very brief article anticipates our discussion of standards policy.
In it, Schoechle points out that standards organizations promulgate rules
that change the world in ways that have material consequences for people's
lives, and in that sense they can be viewed as making public policy.  This
analogy between standards organizations and legislatures is an important
counterbalance to the predominance of economic analysis in the literature
on standardization.  Standardization is not just a marketplace but a public
sphere, and it is altogether remarkable how these two seemingly opposite
analogies are able to work so well at the same time.

<blockquote>
The production of a standard requires effort and resources, and yet the
resulting standard can typically be practiced by a wide variety of parties
who did not contribute to it.  Conventional theory therefore predicts that
the economy will not produce enough standards.  This is the most basic
economic idea for understanding the dynamics of standards organizations.
Kindleberger sketches several historical cases and analyzes the risks of
market failure.

As telecommunications becomes increasingly privatized and competitive, the
strategic interests of various industry players are increasingly played
out in standards-setting forums.  As a result, those forums find themselves
under increasing tension.  David and Shurmer describe these tensions.  They
point to the increasing attractiveness of by-passing the official forums,
and they point to potential reforms that might increase the capacity of
those forums to resolve the more complicated and sharply drawn conflicts in
the industry.

One common hypothesis in the standards literature is the supposed trend
toward anticipatory standards, that is, standards developed in advance of
the market instead of in reaction to it.  Anticipatory standards make sense
when network externalities threaten significant losses for firms whose
products become stranded.  Given that motivation to agree on a standard a
priori, Weiss describes a range of strategies that firms might take in the
standards process.

<blockquote>
Another recurring issue in the standards literature is the role of users.
Involving users in standardization processes is this literatures' version of
motherhood and apple pie, but the ideal is rarely achieved.  The situation
is most propitious when the users are highly sophisticated, understand their
stake in getting good standards, and are organized enough for sustained
involvement in the process.  Such is the case with manufacturing standards,
and companies such as General Motors have even taken considerable initiative
to impose standards on their suppliers.  And yet, in the end, the process
has still been largely dominated by the vendors.  Dankbaar and van Tulder
explain why this is.

Standards-driven markets can be extraordinarily complicated from a strategic

availability of a full product network, anticipating the interactions among
different firms' strategies, market-tilting tactics such as preannouncement,
and attempts to influence a standard substantively.

<blockquote>
The success of a new product usually does not depend solely on its inherent
attributes.  Quite the contrary, customers will only buy the product if
an array of complementary products is available.  As a result, strategists
attempting to maximize the return from innovation will naturally wish to
analyze the market for these complementary products.  A fundamental point
of strategy is whether to provide those complementary products oneself.

<blockquote>
Farrell and Saloner present a mathemtical model of the consequences of
network effects for transitions between standards.  The relatively intuitive
result is that, because of the network effects that tend to lock customers
into the standards they are already using, a market may exhibit "excess
inertia" in the transition to a new standard.  The less intuitive result
is that, if those same customers understand the dangers of being "stranded"
in the standard of their installed base, then the market may instead exhibit
"excess momentum" in the form of a premature transition to a new standard.

institutional biases in network design, in Robin Mansell and Roger

<blockquote>
This is a sophisticated theoretical analysis of the idea that standards can
embody inherent biases.  It follows that competition over standards is not
simply a matter of who defines the standards, but also a matter of what the
standard substantively consists of, and what its consequences will be once
it is placed in operation.  These considerations define a strategic field
of great complexity, and they help explain the dynamics of standardization
processes, and particularly the forums that established players choose in
pursuing their standardization goals in a supposedly globalizing context.

<blockquote>
Standards competitions are not always simple matters of symmetrically
organized, head-to-head battles to the death between conflicting standards.
Individual firms have many other choices, such as adopting another firm's
standard and competing on production efficiencies.  Because the rewards
of each strategy depend on the strategies chosen by others, competition in
standards markets has a game-theoretic quality.  Besen and Farrell's model
attempt to preduct which strategies will be chosen depending on each firm's
relative initial positioning in the marketplace.

An emerging theme in the literature is the interaction between the structure

Week 8 / Policy <p>

<blockquote>
For people from many backgrounds, standards tend to imply de jure standards

This was historically the case in telecommunications, but as world changes
the question arises of government's proper role in the standards process.
Ideological approaches to the question tend toward the predictable extremes,
but in the middle lies a very complicated range of alternatives whose
advisability depends on the interactions among numerous aspects of the
standardization process.

Economics of Standards in Natural and Technical Environments, Edward Elgar,
1995. <p>

<blockquote>
The choice between standardization and non-standardization is often framed
as a choice between the respective virtues of order and freedom, and
standards policy is consequently framed in similar terms.  David, though,
argues that this analysis is ill-posed.  Instead, he urges us to view
the institutional processes of standards-setting as a dynamic response to
a dynamic environment.  The consequences for policy are complicated and
largely pessimistic.

<blockquote>
Krislov's book is a comparative study of standardization policies as part
of broader national industrial and economic strategies.  This concluding
chapter draws on his case studies of the United States, European Union,
Japan, and the erstwhile Soviet Europe by placing the evolution of standards
and standardization processes in that broader institutional perspective.

<blockquote>
AM radio in the United States is an example of a laissez faire policy that
led to rapid, sharp competition between competing standards, selecting a
clear winner without stranding too many consumers.  Berg briefly recounts
the particulars and tries to derive lessons for the broader question of
markets for interdependent components.

<blockquote>
Farrell argues that the market dynamics of standards recommend a limited
role for intellectual property protection in general and copyright in
particular.  If the economy benefits from compatibility, then the difficult
question is whether and when intellectual property rights encourage markets
to evolve toward compatibility.

Week 9 / Antitrust <p>

<blockquote>
The most topical policy question relating to standards is antitrust law.
A company that owns proprietary de facto standards possesses a license
to print money, particularly when those standards enable the company to
leverage its control into new markets.  The law is struggling to comprehend
this phenomenon in traditional antitrust categories, and we will consider
a range of opinions.

<blockquote>
This is a lengthy but lucid explication of the theory of standards lock-in
as applied to antitrust law.  Its conclusions are skeptical.  Antitrust
law is held to be incapable of regulating standards-driven industries, and
standards organizations are held to be overwhelmingly pro-competition.

<blockquote>
When markets are dominated by proprietary standards, it is commonly argued
that the standard constitutes an "essential facility" in the sense provided
by American antitrust law.  This argument is almost never successful in
court, but Jones and Turner lay it out nonetheless in the case of Microsoft
Windows.

<blockquote>
These scholars, as we have already seen, are highly skeptical of the network
externality theory of market failure.  In this article they apply their
critiques to antitrust issues, arguing that the foresight and sophistication
of market participants is sufficient to ensure that the best technology
wins in a standards competition.  The consequence, of course, is that the
government has no reason intervene.

Arthur's economic model of technological lock-in through positive returns
to scale suggests that monopolies can arise through self-reinforcing
market mechanisms, and that those mechanisms do not necessarily select the
optimal technology.  The model abstracts away from far too many aspects of
real-world technology markets to be evaluated in isolation, but it suggests
many possible lines of research.  I have included it as a recommended

On one analysis, the dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft
concerns what antitrust lawyers call "tying".  This article analyzes the
leading tying case, in which Kodak required the companies that bought its
photocopiers to purchase parts and supplies for those copiers exclusively
from Kodak.  The intuition is that this constitutes restraint of trade to
the extend that the vendor has market power, and the question then arises
of what market power is and how one measures it.

Week 10 / Implementation <p>

<blockquote>
We'll focus mainly on the case studies this week, so the reading is light.
I just want to remind us that proclaiming a standard does not automatically
cause the world to become uniform.  This week's readings, therefore, show
what happens when standards are put into practice.  In particular, I want
to point at the interaction between the standardization of information
and communications technologies, which has been our primary focus, and the
standardization of everything else in the world.

<blockquote>
Several traditions in science and technology studies have used ethnographic
methods to argue that standards are social constructions.  That doesn't mean
that they aren't real, but it does force a sophisticated rethinking of what
it means for them to be real.  This article derives from the same "actor
network" school as Callon's article in week 2.  It describes some of work
that is required in executing work processes in a standardized way -- that
is, in a way that a bureaucracy can recognize as conforming to a standard --
together with the cascading consequences of this work.

<blockquote>
Technical people are accustomed to defining the behavior of a computer
solely in terms of its internal workings.  As Bowker points out, however,
most computers process information that derives from diverse places
and times in the world.  Those numbers will only be useful if they are
commensurable, and they will only be commensurable if the world itself is
standardized, together with the practices by which the numbers are defined
and captured.  Simple though it may be, this observation has profound
consequences for our understanding of computers and computation.

<blockquote>
Casson's chapter is a whirlwind introduction to information economics.
Markets are frequently claimed to have near-miraculous properties, but
underneath those claims are numerous assumptions, including the assumption
that information is plentiful and free.  But information is a commodity
that gets produced and distributed like any other, and it will only get
produced in large quantities if somebody pays for it.  One consequence of
this seeming paradox, Casson argues, is that increases in the efficiency
of information production will cause reality to approximate the wonderland
of economics.  Put this argument together with Bowker's, and it becomes
possible to comprehend the profound embedding of computers in evolving
institutional arrangements.
