Fall 2006 <br>
Monday 1:30pm - 4:50pm <br>
Dodd Hall, room 146 <p>

This is a course about knowledge.  Its main idea is that an analysis of
particular types of knowledge as social phenomena can facilitate innovations
that dramatically improve people's access to that knowledge.  Examples will
be drawn from law, physics, history, Near Eastern and African studies, public
health, microbiology, and engineering. <p>

Each class meeting will have three parts.  During the first part, we will
discuss the previous week's readings in a seminar format.  During the second
and most important part, we will discuss particular types of knowledge that
individual students are interested in, analyzing them using ideas from the
readings and then brainstorming ways of improving access to them.  And the
third part will be a lecture that introduces the readings for the subsequent
week. <p>

The main requirement of the course is a scholarly paper that uses ideas from
the readings and discussions to analyze a particular type of knowledge and
explain how that analysis motivates new methods for promoting public access
to that knowledge.  The assignment for this paper is on the Web at: <p>

<a href = http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/knowledge-assignment.html>http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/knowledge-assignment.html</a> <p>

Each student should also select a week during the course when the course
readings provide the best context for discussing their particular type of
knowledge, and then prepare an informal presentation about that type of
knowledge and the possible modes of access to it.  The assignment for this
discussion is here: <p>

Grades will depend on the term paper (70%) and presentation (30%).  There are
no exams. <p>

There are ten required texts.  All of them are worth the time and money.
They should all be on sale at the bookstore, but they might also be available
more cheaply from used bookstores on the Internet:
&lt;<a href = http://www.addall.com/Used/>http://www.addall.com/Used/</a>&gt;
or &lt;<a href = http://www.amazon.com/>http://www.amazon.com/</a>&gt;.
Note that one of the readings, Watson, will be available as a reading
packet.  If you are unable to afford all of the readings, which would
be understandable, they are all available for reading in the department's
laboratory. <p>

Ash Amin and Patrick Cohendet, <i>Architectures of Knowledge: Firms,
Capabilities, and Communities</i>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004.
This book is unfortunately somewhat expensive, but it is worth the money
because it is packed with ideas. <p>

Isaiah Berlin, <i>Three Critics of the Enlightenment</i>, edited by Henry
Hardy, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000.  The chapters we are
reading were originally published in 1960. <p>

Harold J. Berman, <i>Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal
Tradition</i>, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983. <p>

Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, <i>Sorting Things Out: Classification
and Its Consequences</i>, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1999. <p>

Edmund Burke, <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i>, edited by L. G.
Mitchell, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999.  Originally published in
1790.  If you already have another edition of Burke then fine, but otherwise
please buy this edition (it's cheap) so that we can all refer to the same page
numbers in class. <p>

Bruno Latour, <i>The Pasteurization of France</i>, translated by Alan Sheridan
and John Law, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988. <p>

V. Y. Mudimbe, <i>The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order
of Knowledge</i>, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1988. <p>

Edward Said, <i>Orientalism</i>, New York: Pantheon, 1978. <p>

Steven Shapin, <i>A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in
Seventeenth-Century England</i>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994.
<p>

Helen Watson, <i>Singing the Land, Signing the Land</i>, Geelong, Australia:
Deakin University, 1989.  This book is out of print, but a reading packet will
be available for it. <p>

I unfortunately ought to emphasize that I do not necessarily endorse these
books.  They represent a range of controversial ideas, and our goal is not to
agree with them but to use them critically in analyzing the past and possible
futures of particular types of knowledge. <p>

(I tried to have reading packets made for the few chapters that we will be
reading from Berman and Shapin, but it turns out that those packets would be
more expensive than buying the whole books.) <p>
