This class reconstructs the classical computer science topics of "systems
analysis and design" -- mapping information flows and data modeling -- within
a framework derived from industrial design.  Compared with the traditional
approach, our focus of attention will shift from systems to services,
mainframes to networks, the desktop to the street, organizational workplaces
to institutionally organized relationships, cognition to physical activity,
and individual users to communities of practice.  The class will be organized
around presentations by interdisciplinary teams, with minimal lecturing and
written work.  We will attend closely to the design process, and the teams'
own experiences will become raw material for their projects.
<p>

Two books are required:  <p>

David G. Messerschmitt, <i>Networked Applications: A Guide to the New
Computing Infrastructure</i>, Morgan Kaufman, 1999.  This is an outstanding
plain-language introduction to the structure of modern information
systems. <p>

Donald A. Norman, <i>The Invisible Computer</i>, MIT Press, 1999.  This is a
polemic against the personal computer and in favor of a new generation of
diverse and specialized computing devices. <p>

Another book is recommended: <p>

Jeffrey L. Whitten and Lonnie D. Bentley, <i>Systems Analysis and Design
Methods</i>, fourth edition, Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1998.  This is a thorough
introduction to the conventional practice of systems analysis and design.
If you are going to work with people who have the conventional training then
it will be useful reference book.  But as I say, I regard this material as
out-of-date. <p>

Here are summaries of the group projects from week to week: <p>

<a href = "week2.html"><i>Assignment for week 2: Team-Building Exercise.</i></a>
Everyone writes down their skill set and gets copies of everyone else's.
Class members then form themselves into teams.  Each team's members discuss
their past and future, and how they complement one another.  They draw a
diagram that gives clear form to the conclusions they have reached, and they
design a presentation around it. <p>

<a href = "week3.html"><i>Assignment for week 3: Seeing information
happen.</i></a> Each team gets a distinct assignment, all of which involve
going out in the world and watching information happen.  Bring back what
you've observed and show us.  If you use what you've learned in other classes
about information seeking then that's great.  But we really want you to be
observant and name things, and learn how to show what you've seen in a way
that changes how other people see the world. <p>

<a href = "week4.html"><i>Assignment for week 4: Growth of the
technology.</i></a> Each team again gets a distinct assignment, this time
involving library work on the state of information technology ten years from
now.  Because of Moore's Law and related phenomena, we can predict reasonably
well the quantitative properties of computing.  Processors, for example, will
be 100 times faster.  What about mass storage, memory chips, wireline and
wireless bandwidths, penetration rates of the technologies both domestically
and globally, and so on?  What important standards will be widely deployed by
then?  Show us what you've found. <p>

<a href = "week5.html"><i>Assignment for week 5: Layering.</i></a> Building on
last week, we will do an exercise about the concept of a platform: a service
upon which a diversity of other services can be built.  The hard part is
figuring out what belongs in the generic service, and what the interface
should look like between the platform and the services that are built on it.
This is going to be a central concept for design in the future.  By this time
we will have discussed several examples of platforms.  <p>

<a href = "week6.html"><i>Assignment for week 6: Show us your collaboration
patterns.</i></a> All the while you've been documenting your team's work
process.  This might mean keeping notes, taking pictures, drawing diagrams,
videotaping, saving your work, etc.  You have probably also settled into
something of a routine.  Show us how you work together.  Along the way we
will offer several ideas about what to look for.  For example, where is the
borderline between "routine" and "improvised"?  This will be important in
the coming weeks as we mess with the traditional concepts of systems analysis.
This is the first week of <a href = "final-project.html">a six-week iterative
design exercise</a>. <p>

<a href = "week7.html"><i>Assignment for week 7: Ontology of collaborative
work.</i></a> Data modeling is the only idea from traditional systems analysis
that is intellectually hard, so we will spend some extra time in class working
an example of it.  Then your assignment will be to model the data that will
be required to implement one or more of your prospective services.  Whereas
earlier assignments have called on you to invent your own representation
schemes, for this assignment we'll have you use a conventional notation scheme
for data models.  Having done so, sketch an information service that you might
like to design to support collaborative work activities. <p>

<a href = "week8.html"><i>Assignment for week 8: Service design.</i></a>
Now it is time to spell out the details of a potential information service
for collaborative work.  To prepare for this, think about your service
from several angles.  What institutional roles are people playing as they
use the service?  Where are they located?  What actions do they need to take?
Who gets access to what information?  Who creates the data that goes in the
databases?  Which parts of the data should be structured, and what should
the structure be?  What existing services does your service exchange data
with?  And so on.  Having explored all of these questions, draw a dataflow
diagram for the service you are designing, decomposing the design into enough
component processes and databases to get a clear idea of its properties. <p>

<a href = "week9.html"><i>Assignment for week 9: Information design.</i></a>
Using cardboard, crayons, glue, and other materials found in kindergarten
classrooms, build a mockup of one or more of your services.  Show what your
service will look like in practice, and tell us how it is comprehensible.
We will have discussed some examples of information design, including several
that have nothing to do with computers.  We want computers to be more like
the diagrams in Edward Tufte's books.  We also want them to be more like the
information appliances that Norman argues for. <p>

<a href = "week10.html"><i>Assignment for week 10: Service architecture.</i></a>
Having sketched first the insides and then the outsides of your service, it
will be time to return to the inside, applying serious architectural concepts
this time.  How are the processes and databases that comprise your service
divided among the various networked devices that they run on?  You will have
been reading Messerschmidt throughout the quarter, and this is where you will
apply everything in that book. <p>

<a href = "week11.html"><i>Assignment for finals week.</i></a> We don't imagine
that anyone will be around during finals week to see your work, and so instead
we will have each group videotape a final presentation that we can put on
the Web.  This will include your service mockup, its information design and
internal architecture, how it works cognitively, how the information flows,
and generally how it works as a service in the full sense.
