<h3>
IS 240 -- Information Systems Analysis and Design <p>

Final project assignment <p>
</h3>

We will be exploring a single question through a series of six weekly
projects.  The purpose of this message is to define that question. <p>

It is sometimes said that computer networks will render space unimportant.
According to this scenario, face-to-face interaction will disappear.  Paper
and office buildings will be unnecessary.  Everyone will live in the country.
We will deal with one another through video conferencing, or holograms, or
something.  That scenario is nonsense.  It's not happening, and it takes only
a moment's thought to see why it will never happen.  People need, want, and
value physical proximity for many purposes, and not just because they are
nostalgic Luddites.  When we design new information services, therefore, our
goal should not be to replace physical interaction entirely.  We will not be
moving from a world that's entirely face-to-face to a world that's entirely
virtual.  That kind of primitive dichotomy is not helpful.  Instead, we must
look for the dividing line between physical and virtual interaction.  That
dividing line already exists, of course.  We conduct much business over the
telephone, by Fedex, by e-mail.  With the growth of new technologies, we will
probably conduct a different subset of our interactions through technological
mediation.  But which subset?  That is our question. <p>

A story may help make the issue intuitive.  Finance is largely a matter of
information, and so one would expect that the vast growth of information and
communication technologies would cause financial people to scatter across the
landscape.  After all, financial people must often travel to investigate the
businesses in which they are investing, and they can build trust with their
customers by meeting them face-to-face as well.  In fact, the opposite trend
is happening.  Finance is becoming ever more concentrated in a small number
of "world cities" such as New York.  Despite the power of new technologies,
finance people want to be physically close to other finance people.  Why?
To negotiate the complex deals that the new technologies make possible, and
to build the complex social networks that the ever-shifting world of financial
deal-making requires.  Many financial activities *are* moving to places
like North Dakota.  But these activities do not involve deal-making.  Rather,
they are the "back-office" activities like bookkeeping, which can be moved
to places where labor is cheap, as well as the "customer service" activities,
which can be moved to places where the people have the kind of interactional
style that customers like.  Cities like New York, therefore, are increasingly
organized around financiers, and around the services that financiers need
to get in person: restaurants, culture, building maintenance, those types of
retail that don't work over the Internet, and so on. <p>

The moral of this story is that the Internet does not scatter us by severing
all of our physical bonds with one another.  What the Internet does, more
subtly, is to sever *some* of the physical bonds that connect us to other
people, and to material things.  We then respond by strengthening the bonds
that remain.  People who run all-virtual businesses, for example, can move
back to their hometown, or live near their favored recreational activities.
When the personal computer is no longer tied to the desktop, many types of
work will be able to move as well.  Some of this work will certainly move to
the Bahamas, but most of it will move to places that are determined by the
worker's irreducibly physical connections: onto airplanes, into hotel rooms,
into the home, into meeting spaces shared with team members, onto building
sites and factory floors, and so on.  Work activities will be divided in
different ways, so that each element of the work takes place in the physical
location that is best suited to it.  Collaborative work in particular will
be divided more precisely, with some elements being conducted face-to-face
and other elements being conducted through various media.  Sometimes the team
members will be pulled together by the comparative advantages of face-to-face
interaction for specific purposes, and other times they will be pulled apart
by the comparative advantages of being physically close to different people,
places, or things in the rest of the world.  And the information services
that support them will be designed to respond smoothly to these fluctuations:
by being portable, by supporting the types of mediated interaction that the
team members need, by delivering information in a manner that is fitted to
particular work settings (mobile, collaborative, noisy, hands full, eyes on
the road, large drawings, familiar document genres, familiar collaboration
practices, and so on). <p>

We want you to think about these phenomena as you observe your own team's
work practices.  What do you need to do together, and what can you do apart?
What roles do the various communications media play in your collaboration?
How do you use information services together?  How do your complementary
skills motivate asymmetric roles in the work process?  What kinds of tools
could loosen unnecessary physical bonds?  What do you need to do together,
and what can you do separately?  Is the quality of your work constrained by
the difficulty of arranging face-to-face team meetings at the right times or
in the right amounts?  What elements of your face-to-face interactions could
be done at a distance with the right tools?  How do you keep track of one
another?  How do you wish you could keep track of one another?  What stages
of "processing" does information go through as it passes from (say) database
to notes to group meeting to draft presentation?  What information resources
do you wish you had?  What tools would enable you to iterate designs more
effectively as a group, whether you are in the same room or not?  What if you
had electronic paper that was portable, could be used as a computer display,
could be drawn on like a whiteboard, and so on?  What if you had a shared
workspace that was visible to everyone regardless of distance?  Would these
things really be useful?  What specifically would they really be useful for,
and what would they not be useful for?  How do your work practices fit, or
fail to fit, with the rest of your life?  What tools would enable the team's
work to go ahead even as the team members juggle their other commitments?
How could everyone renegotiate the boundaries between work and home, between
work and school, between the demands of different classes, among the various
activities for this course?  What design issues arise because of the team
members' diverse disciplinary backgrounds, professional languages, and skills?
What could you do if everyone had a dozen new platforms -- portable devices,
computing power and display screens built into your car, interfaces that use
speech recognition when your hands are occupied, shared audio spaces -- and
useful "groupware" applications to run on them?  What kinds of boundaries
would you need to establish in order to stay sane in such a world, and how
could the tools support them? <p>

Our purpose in the design exercises will be to explore these questions.  We
want you to reflect on your team's experiences so that you'll be approaching
these exercises in a thoughtful way, and in a way that's in full contact with
reality.  We'll get into the details when the time comes.
