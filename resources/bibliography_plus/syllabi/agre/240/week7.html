IS 240 -- Information Systems Analysis and Design <p>

Assignment for week 7: Ontology of collaborative work <p>
</h3>

The most important task of a systems analyst is to decide which entities the
system is going to represent.  This is a strange task, one that falls across
the boundary between engineering and metaphysics.  The basic question is
this: what does this particular system think that the world is made of?  For
the past quarter century, the task of answering this question has been called
"data modeling".  Although methodologies for data modeling have proliferated,
their basic method is to perform a rational reconstruction of the concepts
of the people -- the customers, that is, and not necessarily the "end users"
-- who want the system built.  The customers' nouns become data entities and
their verbs become processes.  I make data modeling sound easy, but of course
it's not.  It has the advantage of encouraging the analyst to listen and learn
about the world where the system will be used, but it has the disadvantage
that the customers' concepts, for all their authenticity, might not add up to
a sufficiently solid metaphysics.  In this assignment, therefore, we will skip
the listening part and focus on our own concepts. <p>

Your task this week is to prepare a data model for an information service that
might support interdisciplinary team-based work.  You'll work back and forth
between guessing what entities the service should represent and guessing what
it will do.  Come up with a few scenarios, and present a data model that would
provide the groundwork for them.  I do not assume that the meaning of this
assignment is obvious, and so I will explain it at some length. <p>

Let us begin with an example.  Suppose that one were to design a service
for reserving meeting rooms.  The meeting room calendar would be visible to
everyone who works in a given office, presumably by pulling up a Web page,
and anyone would be able to claim a block of time.  What entities would such
a service need to represent?  To find out, one simply pulls out the words
from the informal specification I've given.  I'll start by repeating the
relevant hunk of text:

<blockquote>
... for reserving meeting rooms.  The meeting room calendar would be
visible to everyone who works in a given office, presumably by pulling
up a Web page, and anyone would be able to claim a block of time.
</blockquote>

Here are the nouns:

<blockquote>
meeting room <br>
calendar <br>
someone/anyone <br>
office <br>
block of time <br>
Web page
</blockquote>

here is another word that looks meaningful: <p>

<blockquote>
visible
</blockquote>

here are the verbs:

<blockquote>
pull up (the Web page) <br>
claim (block of time) <br>
works (in the office)
</blockquote>

We have most of what we need, but we need to clean it up a little: <p>

 * The entity "meeting room" seems straightforward.  In practice there
will be gray areas: how about classrooms, lunch rooms, and so on?  Perhaps
those decisions will be left to the people who configure the service for a
particular office; they will decide what precisely the phrase "meeting room"
will mean for them. <p>

 * How about the entity "calendar"?  We only need to represent it as a
distinct entity if there is more than one calendar.  One calendar can include
many meeting rooms, so do we have any reason to support multiple calendars?
I can imagine a reason, for example if the same system is going to support
many offices.  We should ask the customer. <p>

 * The words "someone" and "anyone" are obviously meant as informal glosses.
In logical terms they are quantifiers, and they leave implicit what they are
quantifying over.  The phrase "everyone who works in a given office" sounds
like a relationship, so we can say that an entity of "person" can be related
by "works in" to an office.  Once we start filling in the entity-relationship
diagram, we will be forced to ask some useful questions: can the same person
work in more than one office?  We might also wonder about the connection
between this entity of "person" and an entity such as "employee" that another
data model might have.  Questions will soon arise.  Can a visitor reserve a
meeting room?  How about a temporary employee?  An intern?  The big boss who
works in headquarters? <p>

 * The entity "office" is clear enough.  We'll have to decide whether every
office has exactly one calendar and vice versa; if so then that constraint
is easy enough to express in an entity-relationship diagram.  Or perhaps we
don't want the extra generality of multiple offices and multiple calendars,
in which case neither "office" nor "calendar" will be entities.  Or perhaps
we have some good reason to loosen the mapping between offices and calendars.
<p>

 * The phrase "block of time" could be an entity.  It sounds like it has some
internal structure, like a date, a starting hour, and an ending hour.  That's
fine.  In an entity-relationship diagram, this internal structure would be
coded as more entities and relationships.  So the "block of time" entity
could have both a "starts at" relation and an "ends at" relation to the "time"
entity, as well as a "occurs on" relation to the "date" entity.  This kind of
thinking will be alien to those who are accustomed to object-oriented design,
but it adds up to the same thing in the end. <p>

 * How about "Web page"?  Is that an entity?  Perhaps not -- it might be
the way that calendars are implemented.  We have to keep our service layers
straight, and "Web page" might be an entity on a different service layer --
the Web, to be precise -- than the one we are designing. <p>

 * How about "visible"?  At first it sounds like a relationship between
the "calendar" entity and the "person" entity.  But in an office with 100
employees, that would require us to record 100 relationships between people
and calendars.  If we really are saying that every calendar is visible to
everyone who works in a given office, then maybe it's enough to relate a
calendar to an office (and vice versa), and then relate an office to a bunch
of people (and vice versa).  The "visible" relationship might be redundant.
If someone wants to query whether calendar X is visible to person Y, that
query could simply be expanded into a two-part conjunction: is there an office
O such that X works in O and the calendar for booking meeting rooms in O is Y?
<p>

 * Let's talk about the verbs.  The verbs are probably not part of the data
model.  They represent processes that we can implement once the data model
is defined and the necessary databases are implemented.  But it is useful
to look at the verbs and make sure that they stand in a coherent relation
to the data model.  We can ask "who can do it?" and "what can they do it to?".
A person can pull up a calendar if they stand in a certain relationship to
it, and so on.  All looks well.  Of course, we may discover extra complexities
and ambiguities later on, but hopefully by clarifying our concepts now we have
minimized the potential for major surprises. <p>

That's a simple example.  Here are some other examples that would be a lot
more complicated: <p>

 * A system for recording design rationales.  As the team talks its way
through the design process, someone takes notes on every proposal offered,
every issue raised, every constraint discerned, every trade-off defined,
every choice made, every reason given, and so on.  That way, once the design
is completed and the finished system is implemented, the original designers'
wisdom doesn't disappear when they do.  A later generation of designers
who need to modify the system can go back to the design rationale and learn
why the choices were made.  That way, they can avoid making mistakes that
the original designers had thoughtfully avoided.  In fact, because the
rationale explicitly represents every component of the designed system, it
should be possible to hyperlink from a diagram of the system to a complete
rationale for the design of each part.  The problem with design rationale
capture is that the design rationales are wildly complicated.  The necessary
data model is huge and baroquely metaphysical.  This is a case where it's
important to be judicious about structure, only imposing structure on those
elements of the rationale that someone truly needs to be able to search on,
compute with, or otherwise turn into standardized data.  After all, if nobody
really needs the rationale to become an array of database entries then you
can much more easily just roll a videotape during the design meetings, or
else hold structured interviews with the designers and capture those on tape.
The resulting unstructured data, with perhaps some metadata on top of it, will
be much easier to create than structured data, and will present many fewer
controversies. <p>

 * A system for recording designs, including the partial designs from halfway
through the design process.  Here you would need a vocabulary in which all of
the designs could be described.  You might want entities such as "component",
"input", "output", "process", and even "entity" -- after all, you would want
to represent the data model for a design.  Such a system would be terribly
useful: you could have a design editor with a point-and-click interface.
The interface could automatically check your design for obvious errors, or
it could prompt you to fill in missing information.  It could also display
the design in many different diagram conventions, because it would have some
comprehension of the internal structure of the design. <p>

 * A system for recording skill sets.  Imagine an organization with 10,000
employees, all of whom work in an endless shuffle of interdisciplinary teams.
A program manager might enter the skill set that a team would need taken all
together, and the system could propose different groups of people who would
cover all those skills.  You would probably want to represent availability,
geographic constraints, and things like that.  Perhaps the skills can be
represented with a nice big hierarchical vocabulary, or perhaps skills are
more complicated.  The question, however, is not whether "skills" as such are
complicated in general, as a matter of objective truth.  Rather, the question
is how the customer talks about skills, and how the customer might want to
talk about skills in the future.  Get the talking started, and then parse it.
<p>

Entity-relationship data models are not terribly complicated.  They force
clear thinking about some very basic questions, and as such they are a huge
advance over the haphazard design methods of yore.  But they are limited
in many ways.  Perhaps most importantly, they are not hierarchical.  That
is, they do not provide a natural way to represent relationships between
entities that generalize or specialize one another.  Consider, for example,
a data model with entities such as "person" and "employee".  How to notate
the obvious relationship between these two entities?  One could define a
relationship like "is-a", as in "an employee is a person".  But that would
be wildly ambiguous.  Why not say "Joe is an employee"?  Because those are
two differnet meanings of "is-a", only the former of which belongs in an
entity-relationship diagram.  (Joe is not an entity; he is an entity instance.
In other words, Joe is not a concept but a particular example of a concept.
He would have his own row in a database.)  Also, the entity-relationship
scheme provides no natural way to represent what mathematicians call the
"transitivity" of "is-a": if a vice-president is an employee and an employee
is a person, it follows that a vice-president is a person.  AI people who
work in the area of "knowledge representation" have invested tremendous
effort sorting out (what they call) the "epistemological status" of all of
the various links one might wish to draw in an entity-relationship diagram:
links representing causal connections, logical connections, part-whole
relationships, and so on.  Those who are interested in such things can see the
citations in my chapter of "Technology and Privacy". <p>

We need not get into those things for the assignment, but I do think it is
useful to work through an example of (what the object-oriented framework
calls) a class hierarchy.  Having worked through your data model, therefore,
you might give some thought to the natural abstractions that your model
presents.  To continue the previous example, if your data model includes
entities called "person" and "employee", then obviously "employee" is a
subclass of "person" (although police dogs are supposedly considered police
department employees).  Or to take a more abstract example, "decision" might
be a subclass of "action", which is a subclass of "event".  This is where
the metaphysics comes in.  One might try to enumerate every subclass of
"action" which occurs in the course of team-based work -- it sounds crazy,
and it's definitely impossible, but it's a useful exercise anyway.  Don't try
to represent these class/subclass relationships in the entity-relationship
model (it can be done, but you don't want to know how).  Just start from
your entities, call them each a class, fill in the missing subclasses and
superclasses to complete the class hierarchy, and draw a simple diagram in
which the classes are arrayed in a hierarchical tree-structure, or an outline.
<p>

As a reminder, don't try to do everything.  Your data model should not be an
encyclopedia or a dictionary.  The point is to make design studies that focus
in a sustained way on a limited set of issues in hopes of learning larger
lessons.  If your data model has fifteen or twenty entities then you're in
good shape, and you can probably do a thoughtful design exercise with fewer.
"Sustained" here means working the example over several times, hitting walls
or noticing patterns each time, and then starting over.  Next week we'll move
onward from the data model to the uses that could be made of it.  But it'll
be useful to think ahead this week, making scenarios that might be spelled out
in more detail next week.  In fact, next week you may well have to backtrack,
reworking part or all of your data model as the practicalities of data
plumbing become clearer.
