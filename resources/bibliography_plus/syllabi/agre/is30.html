IS 30 is an introduction to the ways in which the Internet and related
technologies are helping to reorganize a wide variety of relationships in
society.  Topics include access to information, information technology in
organizations and workplaces, electronic politics and education, intellectual
property, the origins of the Internet, and new uses of wireless technology
by the military.  The course has no prerequisites and assumes no technical
background beyond e-mail and the Web. <p>

For the most part, Wednesdays will be theoretical lectures and discussion,
and Mondays will be spent discussing how the ideas from the lectures and
readings apply to particular applications of computing. <p>

There will be three medium-length writing assignments rather than one big one,
and no exams.  Each writing assignment will be one third of the final grade.
The writing assignments are online here: <p>
