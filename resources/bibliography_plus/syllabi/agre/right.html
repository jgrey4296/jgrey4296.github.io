This is a bibliography of books relating to politically conservative
religious movements in the United States, with particular attention
to the history of Christian millennialism.  It includes books from all
political perspectives, including many that I disagree with, so please
do not flame me.  If you have any corrections or additions, however,
please do send them along. <p>
