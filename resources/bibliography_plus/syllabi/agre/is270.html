Wednesday 9:00am - 12:30pm, GSE&amp;IS room 121 <p>

This is a course about information technology, both its basic structures
and its organizational context.  It presupposes that students have met the
MLIS program's programming requirement, that they have completed IS 260
(Information Structures), and that they are actively involved in learning
about the information technology issues that face people in their profession
in daily practice.  The class will not involve technical work in the lab.
Rather, it teaches students to apply fundamental concepts of computing to
the analysis of applications of computing in real professional life.  On the
technical side, the central concepts include networked information services,
layering, modularity, data modeling, and direct-manipulation interfaces.
On the organizational side, major concepts include knowledge management,
standardization, and the ways that systems evolve through interaction between
developers and users. <p>

A central goal of the course is to plug each student into a network of
resources for following the rapidly unfolding field of information technology,
both in general and in its application to their profession.  The assigned
readings are, of course, one means to this end.  In addition, however,
students will be expected, week by week, to discover and use additional
resources of concrete information on the applications of computing that are
most relevant to their own professional concerns.  These additional resources
will fall into roughly four categories: personal experience (e.g., at
a job or internship), professional networks (i.e., people whom the student
knows professionally and whose own experiences of computing the student
can ask about), conference proceedings (for both basic research and current
professional practice), and the <a href = "trade-press.html">trade press</a>
(i.e., magazines about information technology and its applications, whether
paper or online, that are published for the use of professionals in the
computing industry and its organizational customers). <p>

Students will draw on all of these information resources in doing their course
work.  The main requirement for the course is an extended paper, perhaps 25
pages.  This paper should apply a large number of concepts from the course to
analyze real-world materials that derive from personal experience,
professional networks, conferences, and the trade press.  Much of the course
will be organized around the process of designing and writing this paper.  For
example, each class meeting will use the same format: a structured class
discussion in which we apply concepts from the previous week's lecture and
readings to individual students' materials, followed by a lecture on the topic
corresponding to the next week's readings.  A draft of the paper is due in
week 8, and I will provide all students with written comments on their draft
papers by the class meeting in week 9.  Finished papers are due during finals
week. <p>

Students will post their draft and final papers on the Web using a standard
format.  Draft papers will be available only to members of the class, but
final papers will be public.  If your paper receives an A, I am likely to show
it to other people and include it in next year's class reader.  You can keep
your paper out of subsequent years' class readers if you want by informing me
in writing after the class is over. <p>

The final paper will be 75% of the course grade.  The other 25% will be based
on six weekly one-paragraph writing exercises, due in weeks 2 through 7, that
will provide a check on the student's understanding, as well as gathering
material to use in the paper.  These weekly writing exercises will be graded
from 1 to 5, and the lowest of the six grades will be dropped.  The course
will have no exams or quizzes. <p>
