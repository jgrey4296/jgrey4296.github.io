IS 282 -- Winter 2007 <p>

Assignment. <p>

Due in class on February 12th. <p>

Part 1.  Data modeling. <p>

Prepare an entity-relationship diagram for the computer in a restaurant.
To determine what entities and relationships the computer might need to
represent, consider all of the various documents that customers, waiters,
kitchen staff, and managers might use.  Include the attributes for each
entity.  You can draw the entity-relationship diagram for this system either
by hand or with a software tool.  Use either the notation that we used
in class or the notation in the assigned reading from Hoffer, George, and
Valacich.  The goal is not to draw a complete diagram, but rather one that
includes most of the major design issues.  Your diagram should have about
twelve entities, each of which has a single clear meaning.  In the past,
the most difficult issue has been representing the internal structure
of documents such as a menu, together with the things that the documents
represent. <p>

Part 2.  Process modeling. <p>

Prepare a process diagram for a system that maintains class rosters.  An
administrator can enter information about the classes, such as which terms
they are offered, when they meet, and how many units they are.  Students
can sign up for classes, though they cannot sign up for two classes that meet
at the same time.  Students can also drop classes.  Each class has a maximum
number of students, together with a wait list for students beyond that number.
Students can get a list of the classes that they are signed up for, and
professors can get a list of the students who are signed up for a given class.
(In a real system, administrators, students, and professors would have to
log in with passwords before they use the system.  But the process diagram
formalism that we are using makes this hard to draw, so forget about it
for purposes of this assignment.)  You can draw the process diagram for
this system either by hand or with a software tool.  Use the notation in
the assigned reading from Hoffer, George, and Valacich.  The goal is not to
draw a complete diagram, but rather one that includes all of the major design
elements.  Your diagram should have about twenty boxes.
