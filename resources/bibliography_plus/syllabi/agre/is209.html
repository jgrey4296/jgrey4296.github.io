Wednesday 9:00am-12:30pm, GSE&amp;IS room 121 <p>

This course is a seminar about information policy.  It is mainly designed
for MLIS students but PhD students are welcome as well.  The course has no
prerequisites other than those of the information studies program in general.
The course complements several other courses in the program, including
IS 200 (Information in Society) and IS 203 (Seminar on Intellectual Freedom
and Information Policy Issues). <p>

Format.  Some students may not have taken a seminar course before, so first
a few words about the format of the class.  Each week we will read a single
important work about information policy, and we will spend nearly the whole
three-hour class on structured discussion of the reading.  The reading
will average not too far beyond 100 pages a week.  The general idea is that
students will learn by bringing their own ideas and issues to class, and by
hearing how those ideas and issues are worked out by the group.  Every week,
therefore, each student should do the assigned reading and come to class
with a topic for class discussion, including specific page references in
the reading where the topic is most relevant.  We will begin each class
by gathering these topics and sorting them into a logical order.  Then we
will divide the available discussion time into blocks, one for each topic.
The student who introduced a given topic will start the discussion for that
topic's block of time by explaining the topic and identifying a particular
passage that is most relevant to it.  Because the discussion in a seminar is
most useful when it is closely connected to the text, as opposed to floating
in generalized abstractions, it will often be useful to read the passage out
loud, and to read other passages out loud as the discussion proceeds.  Each
class will conclude with a half-hour lecture on the reading for the succeeding
week. <p>

Papers.  The overall purpose of the course is to relate the readings to each
student's own professional interests in as many valuable ways as possible.
The class meetings are simply a resource for each student in trying to achieve
this goal.  The instructor has no way of anticipating what uses the students
might make of the readings, and it is likely that the discussions will happen
very differently each time the course is offered.  Each student's number
one assignment for the course is to identify a topic that draws out and
synthesizes the student's own particular way of relating to the material,
and then to write a 5000-word scholarly paper on this topic.  The topic might
be internal to the readings (e.g., David and Spence's argument analyzed as a
type of design), or it might be an application of concepts from the readings
(e.g., how Weill and Ross's framework might be relevant to information systems
in libraries), or it might disagree with an important idea from the readings
(e.g., Wenger's notion of managing by identity).  In any event, the paper
should be based in substantial way on concepts from the readings, and should
cite them in detail accordingly.  Identifying a topic like this is not
easy -- indeed it is just as difficult as writing the paper -- and the class
discussions will be a good place to try out various candidate topics as
the course goes along.  The paper should be a Web page.  Paper proposals are
due in class during week 7, and all proposals will receive comments within a
week.  Draft papers are due by week 9 -- e-mail Phil a URL.  The paper will be
due on Thursday of finals week. <p>

Course schedule.  The readings indicated for each week should be completed
before that week's class.  There is no reading before the first class meeting.
<p>

Week 1 (October 5).  Introduction. <p>

Week 2 (October 12).  Mill, including the editor's introduction.

<blockquote>
Mill is the most important libertarian theorist of civil liberties.
He advocated aristocratic domination of society, and yet he articulated
the argument for freedom much better than the noisy democrats of his day.
For Mill, freedom entails a particular type of culture whose relationship
to Internet culture, say, is a matter of some importance.
</blockquote>

Week 3 (October 19).  9/11 Commission Report, chapters 3, 6, 8, 11, and 13.

<blockquote>
This is the best government report ever written, and every citizen ought
to read it.  We, however, will be reading it in a special way.  Although
terrorists are of course important, our own topic is information, and the
9/11 report is packed with ideas about information. <p>

We're not reading the September 2005 update to the report, but here it is
anyway: <p>

<a href = http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11-commission/staff-report-sept2005.pdf>http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11-commission/staff-report-sept2005.pdf</a>
</blockquote>

Week 4 (October 26).  Baker, introduction and chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10.

<blockquote>
This is the leading left-wing alternative to Mill's theory.  In contrast
to Mill's theory, Baker argues the more expansive thesis that free speech
exists to promote individual self-realization and participation in social
change.  Is such an idea even intelligible in the wartime climate post-9/11?
</blockquote>

Week 5 (November 2).  Sun.

<blockquote>
It is time for us to learn about China.  Westerners have read many Western
arguments about why China should increase its press freedom.  This, however,
is a Chinese argument for increased press freedom, one whose relationships
to the arguments of Mill and Baker will probably take some analyzing.
</blockquote>

Week 6 (November 9).  Wenger, prologue and part 1.

<blockquote>
The West has generally interpreted learning as something that happens inside
of individuals.  In this ethnography of information work in an office, Wenger
describes types of learning that take place in communities.
</blockquote>

Week 7 (November 16).  Wenger, part 2 and epilogue.

<blockquote>
Learning for Wenger isn't basically about getting something but about
becoming someone -- acquiring, that is, the identity of a community.
The epilogue explains what this novel idea means for the design of
technologies, organizations, and educational systems.
</blockquote>

Week 8 (November 23).  Weill and Ross, chapters 1-5.

<blockquote>
Modern organizational activities are thoroughly mediated by networked
computing systems, and these systems continually grow and change.
This book explains how organizations can design rational policies for
the governance of all this growth and change.
</blockquote>

Week 9 (November 30).  David and Spence.

<blockquote>
The future of the Internet is the grid, a stack of technologies for
bringing together diverse computational resources in a general, dynamic
way.  The grid will make possible new and advanced types of collaboration,
and this paper discusses how these new relationships might be governed.
</blockquote>

Week 10 (December 7).  Draft papers.

<blockquote>
Please bring a draft of your term paper -- as complete as possible -- to
class during week 9, one copy for everyone.  During week 10 we will divide
up the available time and discuss the drafts in whatever ways might be
useful.
