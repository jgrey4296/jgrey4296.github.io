Fall 2005 <br>
Thursday 9:00am-12:30pm, GSE&amp;IS 111 <p>

This is a course about methods from history and other fields for the
interpretation of documents.  It is designed for archivists and librarians,
but it will probably be useful to students from elsewhere in the social
sciences and humanities.  Themes of the course include print culture, the
history of scholarship, genre, rhetoric, and historical memory.  Examples
will be derived from diverse centuries and cultures. <p>

The course will discuss only textual documents, and not, for example, maps,
diagrams, or multimedia.  This is because the analysis of those non-textual
types of content has proceeded along a mostly different track in all of the
major scholarly traditions. <p>

The main idea of the course is that the scholarly interpretation of documents
is critical to the well-being of a modern society.  Scholarly interpretation
occurs on several levels, from the internal economy of the text to the
institutional systems in which texts are made and used. <p>

Each class meeting will have three parts.  During the first part, we will
discuss the previous week's readings in a seminar format.  During the second
and most important part, we will analyze documents that students have brought
in.  And the third part will be a lecture that introduces the readings for
the subsequent week.  The general idea is that the lectures and discussions
will accumulate, week by week, ideas and opinions that will be useful in
analyzing the documents. <p>

The main requirement of the course is a scholarly paper that uses ideas from
the lectures and readings to analyze a particular document or interrelated set
of documents.  The assignment for this paper is on the Web at: <p>

As preparation for the term paper, each student should sign up for a time
to discuss their documents during the middle portion of one of the class
meetings.  The assignment for this discussion is here: <p>

<a href = http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/interpreting-discussion.html>http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/interpreting-discussion.html</a> <p>

Grades will depend on the term paper (70%) and discussion of documents (30%).
There are no exams. <p>

In addition, I have assembled, through immense effort, a reading list of
high-quality books about the interpretation of documents in diverse settings,
and I encourage everyone to sample the books that are related to their own
professional interests in the analysis of documents.  The reading list is
here: <p>

There are eight required texts.  All of them are excellent and worth the time
and money.  They should all be on sale at the bookstore, but they might also
be available more cheaply from used bookstores on the Internet:

or &lt;<a href = http://www.amazon.com/>http://www.amazon.com/</a>&gt;. <p>

<p>

Week 0 (September 29).  Introduction <p>

Week 1 (October 6).  Texts <p>

Read Bazerman and Prior, chapters 2, 4, 5, 10, and 11.

<blockquote>
The readings in this edited book are introductions to five important themes
in the analysis of documents that will recur throughout the course: narrative,
relationships between texts, the combination of multiple codes in a text,
rhetoric, and the embedding of texts in activity systems.
</blockquote>

Week 2 (October 13).  Printing <p>

Read Johns, chapters 1-2.

<blockquote>
We take for granted a world in which texts are what they claim to be. 
For most of history, however, this was not necessarily so.  Johns describes
the very different world of printers in 17th century London, in which
copying (or, mostly, miscopying) of competitors' publications was pervasive.
</blockquote>

Week 3 (October 20).  Institutions <p>

Read Johns, chapters 3-4.

<blockquote>
Our world does have something in common with that of 17th century London:
controversy about the institutions that attempt to regulate copying.  Johns
describes the mechanisms that printers set up for this purpose, as well as
the printing trade's embedding in the political system of the times.
</blockquote>

Week 4 (October 27).  Philology <p>

Read Elman, chapters 1-3.

<blockquote>
Philology is the analysis of ancient texts and languages.  During its heroic
age, philologists rebuilt civilization by determining what the available
documents really were and how they were really related to one another.
Elman discusses the heroic age of philology in Qing dynasty China.
</blockquote>

Week 5 (November 3).  Reading <p>

Read Berry, chapters 2, 3, 6, and 7.

<blockquote>
Berry is a historian with an extraordinary ability to interpret documents.
In this book, she uses several types of documents to reconstruct everyday
life during the century-long uncertainty of Japan's most important civil
war.
</blockquote>

Week 6 (November 10).  Genre <p>

Read Dubrow.

<blockquote>
Genres are the relatively settled structures of texts in a given medium.
As such they are important parts of a culture.  Every genre creates a set
of expectations in the reader, and Dubrow argues that authors mess with
these expectations in numerous ways.
</blockquote>

Week 7 (November 17).  Rhetoric <p>

Read Conley, chapters 1-6.

<blockquote>
Rhetoric began in ancient Greece as a framework for writing speeches.
Rhetoric is important to us because most Western documents for two thousand
years were thoroughly organized by one rhetorical framework or another.
These chapters from Conley discuss the ideas and settings of rhetoric from
the beginning through the 17th century.
</blockquote>

Week 8 (November 24).  Thanksgiving <p>

Week 9 (December 1).  Representation <p>

Read Geertz.

<blockquote>
Documents generally represent people and their lives, and so it is important
how representation works.  The field of anthropology is an interesting
example.  During the 1980's, anthropologists wrote many acute analyses
of their own representational practices, of which this is the most famous.
</blockquote>

Week 10 (December 8).  Memory <p>

Read Wertsch.

<blockquote>
Every society has many interacting types of historical memory.  And when
interpreting a document, it is crucial to reconstruct how the document
has participated in a potentially complicated series of such interactions.
In this book, Wertsch describes the dynamics of historical memory in the
midst of a massive historical change.
