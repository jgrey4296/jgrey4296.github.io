This graduate reading seminar consists of a historical survey of theories
of language as a social practice.  Readings will be taken from linguistics,
anthropology, sociology, and philosophy.  The central question is the dual
nature of language: as both autonomous formal system and medium of social
action, as a product of social processes and a resource for the reproduction
and transformation of culture. <p>

Although the readings will be drawn principally from primary sources, the
course will be organized around William J. Hanks' textbook, <i>Language and
Communicative Practices</i> (Westview Press, 1996).  Since we will consider
works by numerous authors, we will divide the readings into two groups:
longer selections to be considered in detail and shorter selections to become
acquainted with an author's writing.  To get discussion started, each student
will be required to present three of the longer readings. <p>

In addition, weeks 6 and 10 will be devoted to presentations in which each
student applies theoretical material from the course to their own research
projects.  To ensure that everyone gets the maximum benefit from their work
in the course, we will embed these presentations in a larger structure.  On
the Monday night before class, each student should use e-mail to send everyone
else in the class an informal letter of a few pages explaining their project
and detailing the kinds of commentary that would be useful.  On Tuesday
morning before class, everyone should read these letters and print them out
to bring to class.  During the class itself, each presentation should last
15 minutes, allowing 15 minutes for discussion.  During the week after the
presentation, with the benefit of the class discussion, write up a formal
8-page version of it, on the model of a conference paper; provide everyone
else in the class with a copy of this proposal.  Everyone should then prepare
written comments on everyone else's written work.  Grades will be based on
the presentations and written work. <p>
