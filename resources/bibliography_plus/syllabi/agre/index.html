I edit a mailing list called <a href = "rre.html">The Red Rock Eater News
Service</a> (RRE).  The RRE home page includes links to numerous articles and
other items that have gone out on the list.  Here are some how-to's that I've
sent to the list:

<blockquote>

<a href = "grad-school.html"><i>Advice for undergraduates considering graduate
school</i></a> A brief how-to, perhaps ten pages, for undergraduates who
think they might want to get a PhD.  I originally wrote it for students in
my own department, but over time I have extended it in response to comments
from people in other fields.  It emphasizes the value of getting involved in
research and is especially intended for sophomores and juniors. <p>

<a href = "alerts.html"><i>Designing effective action alerts for the
Internet</i></a> This is a guide to designing political action alerts.
It also suggests what kinds of badly designed action alerts you should
refrain from forwarding to others. <p>

<a href = "zine.html"><i>Find your voice</i></a> Writing for a webzine: how to
build a public voice on the Internet that communicates your values in a way
that people can understand. <p>

<a href = "hosting.html"><i>Hosting a speaker</i></a> A guide for graduate
students concerning the practicalities of playing host to a visiting speaker,
for example in a weekly seminar series. <p>

<a href = "leader.html"><i>How to be a leader in your field</i></a> Detailed
instructions for students on the process of becoming an intellectual leader
in your profession.  Identify an emerging issue, talk to people who have
ideas about it, pull the ideas together, publicize the result, and repeat.
This is also the best way to get a job. <p>

<a href = "how-to-help.html"><i>How to help someone use a computer</i></a>
A short set of practical guidelines on helping people use computers without
oppressing them.  I learned most of these ideas from teachers of young
children, but they apply equally well to anyone. <p>

</blockquote>

Here are some syllabi that I have sent to the list:

<blockquote>

<a href = "change.html"><i>Information and institutional change</i></a>
This is an annotated syllabus for an upper-division undergraduate class on the
role of information and information technology in the process of institutional
change. <p>

<a href = "standards.html"><i>Institutional aspects of computing</i></a>
This is an annotated syllabus and reading list for a graduate seminar on the
economic and legal aspects of compatibility standards. <p>

<a href = "language.html"><i>Language and communicative practices</i></a>.
This is a syllabus for a graduate-level course on linguistic practices.
Topics include semiotics, speech acts, indexical reference, and speech genres.
<p>

<a href = "240/index.html"><i>Systems analysis and design</i></a>.  This is
a syllabus for an experimental introductory course on computer system design.
In contrast to the mainframe-centered industrial automation courses of the
past, this one starts with wireless information services and uses design
methods derived from industrial design and architecture. <p>

<a href = "is200.html"><i>Information in society</i></a>.  An analytical
introduction to the social systems that produce and use information. <p>

<a href = "is270.html"><i>Introduction to information technology</i></a>.
A nontechnical introduction to the architecture of networked computing
and the ways that it is designed and used in organizational settings. <p>

</blockquote>

Here are some bibliographies that I have sent to the list:

<blockquote>

<a href = "right.html"><i>Books about religious conservatism in the United
States</i></a> This is a bibliography of 500+ books relating to politically
conservative religious movements in the United States, with particular
attention to the history of Christian millennialism. <p>

<a href = "recent-books.html"><i>Books on the social aspects of computing,
1994-1997</i></a> A bibliography of books on the social, cultural, political,
educational, economic, business, literary, legal, and religious aspects of
networking and computing that were published in English from 1994 to 1997.
<p>

<a href = "understanding.html"><i>Understanding jargon</i></a> Books about the
distortion of language in political controversies. <p>

<a href = "interesting.html"><i>What I'm interested in</i></a> A lengthy
(about 1MB) list of nearly all the books that I have found interesting enough
to write down a citation for since I began keeping records in 1989. <p>
