Fall 2003 <br>
Thursday 9:00am - 12:30pm, GSE&amp;IS room 111 <p>

In this course students are introduced to the ways in which information
and informing processes shape and are in turn shaped by society.  The
nature of information is explored in the context of associated information
techniques, systems and institutions.  Key social issues related to
information creation, distribution and use are reviewed, including the
evolution of information society (especially as embodied in information
work and professions). <p>

The first half of the course (weeks 1 through 5) provides a general framework
for information society issues, including infrastructure, definitions of
information, the progression from oral culture to writing to literacy, and
printing and book culture.  The second half of the course (weeks 6 through
10) address an array of information society issues, including electronic
publishing, intellectual property, digital libraries, access and
equity, privacy, and other social aspects of new information technologies.
Students will gain an overview of a wide range of information society topics,
and will be introduced to concepts that will be developed in more depth
in other courses in the curriculum.  This is a survey course rather than
a comprehensive overview of this vast and rapidly evolving area. <p>


The main requirement for the course is an extended paper, perhaps 25 pages.
This paper should apply a large number of concepts from the course to analyze
the social properties of a specific kind of information.  Much of the course
will be organized around the process of designing and writing this paper.
For example, each class meeting will use the same format: a structured class
discussion in which we apply concepts from the previous week's lecture and
readings to individual students' cases, followed by a lecture on the topic
corresponding to the next week's readings.  A draft of the paper is due in
week 8, and I will return all of the papers with written comments in class
during week 9.  Finished papers are due during finals week. <p>

Students will post their draft and final papers on the Web using a standard
format.  Draft papers will be only available to members of the class, but
final papers will be public.  If your paper receives an A, I am likely to show
it to other people and include it in next year's class reader.  You can keep
your paper out of subsequent years' class readers if you want by informing me
in writing after the class is over. <p>

The final paper will be 75% of the course grade.  The other 25% will be based
on six weekly one-paragraph writing exercises, due in weeks 2 through 7, that
will provide a check on the student's understanding, as well as gathering
material to use in the paper.  These weekly writing exercises will be graded
from 1 to 5, and the lowest of the six grades will be dropped.  The course
will have no exams or quizzes. <p>

The required textbook is available from the LuValle Commons Bookstore (as well
as through online booksellers): <p>

Christine L. Borgman, <i>From Gutenberg to the Global Information
Infrastructure: Access to Information in the Networked World</i>, MIT Press,
2000. <p>

A reading packet in two volumes is available from Academic Publishing; it will
also be for sale at LuValle Commons. <p>

Because the course depends heavily on writing, you should also get a copy of
this excellent book about copyediting: <p>

Claire Kehrwald Cook, <i>Line by Line: How to Edit Your Own Writing</i>,
Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985. <p>
