Political philosophy, for all its frequent brilliance, is also frequently
innocent of the actual workings of politics.  Exceptions are found,
particularly among authors who do fieldwork, for example, Mansbridge
(1980) and Sirianni and Friedland (2001).  But more often the arguments
of the political philosophers are abstracted from everyday political life.
To illustrate what I mean, I will discuss three prominent political theories:
social capital, deliberative democracy, and civic republicanism.  All three
are the objects of vast literatures -- the literature on social capital being
relatively recent, that on deliberative democracy being ancient in its roots
but explosive in the last couple of decades, and that on civic republicanism
being one of the most venerable of any literature on earth.  All of these
literatures are brilliant, but all of them are analytically flawed.  Each
of them, I will argue, suffers for lack of a theory of social skills --
the practical skills of political life broadly construed.  I will conclude
by sketching such a theory with particular reference to the United States,
and by demonstrating that social capital, deliberative democracy, and civic
republicanism must all be reconceptualized as a result of it. <p>

<strong> 1 Social capital </strong> <p>

The concept of social capital draws on a long tradition, starting with
medieval sources and Tocqueville.  But the phrase "social capital", as well
as its connection with the mapping of social networks, begins with Loury
(1977), for whom it served as part of an explanation of poverty in terms
of poorly-functioning community support systems.  Social capital for Loury
was the sum total of other people's capital (e.g., equipment available for
borrowing) to which an individual has access through social connections
of friendship and association.  A related concept, mainly intended to explain
the persistence of social stratification, originates with Bourdieu and
Passeron (1977).  Social capital was then theorized more fully by Coleman
(1990) and by such scholars of social networks as Lin (1982, 2001) [1]. <p>

The idea of social capital entered broad circulation, however, with Robert
Putnam's <i>Making Democracy Work</i> (1993).  Half of good research is having
a good question, and Putnam's question was this: why does northern Italy work
so much better than southern Italy, given that the two halves of the country
share the same government, language, and religion?  The answer, Putnam
suggests, lies in a nonobvious aspect of culture.  Southern Italy is
clientelistic: when people in southern Italy have a problem, they look up and
down social hierarchies.  Northern Italy, by contrast, is associationistic:
when people in the north have a problem, they look laterally to people like
themselves.  They form associations, and the social connections that result
then become resources that the association's members can draw on in the future
[2].  By "social capital", Putnam refers to two things: the stock of social
network connections and the prevailing atmosphere of trust that is conducive
to making such connections [3].  Thus, although the concept of social capital
originates in social theory rather than in political philosophy, Putnam's
conception of social capital is essentially political.  Civic engagement
is one of its elements, but even the founding of businesses and nonpolitical
associations draws on the same generalized reservoir of trust and network
connections as do formal political processes. <p>

One problem with the concept of social capital is that it is not clear why we
should call it "capital" (Arrow 2000, Hodgson 2001: 162, Smith and Kulynych
2002; but cf. Lin 2001: 19).  An individual's own social network, though
lacking a price in the market, is arguably a type of capital, but "capital"
is not the sort of thing that a society can have.  And even if the sum total
of a population's social networks were its collective capital, it is hard
to understand why a prevailing sense of trust should be called "capital".
At least one is stretching the term. <p>

A more serious problem, in my view, is that "social capital" ought to include
a third element that is often left out, namely social skills.  Because Putnam
was comparing northern and southern Italy as regions, we learn less about
differences within those regions.  In reality, life chances, even within a
single region, depend heavily on one's ability to fashion the kinds of lateral
connections that Putnam discusses.  Those social skills are themselves a kind
of capital -- economists would call them "human capital" if they considered
them at all -- and social capital is only going to accrue to individuals
who possess the skills to create it.  Of course, the acquisition of such
advanced social skills is related to associations and trust: if you associate
with people who are skilled at organizing people, and you have relations
of mutual trust with them, then perhaps you can acquire the necessary skills
through apprenticeship or osmosis.  Even so, access to the skills of creating
social capital is hardly a given. <p>

So the three elements of social capital -- networks, trust, and social skills
-- are interrelated.  And the element of social skills should not be taken
for granted.  Many people grow up in environments where the necessary social
skills do not exist, either because everyone is too busy scratching out a
subsistence living, or because they have acquired the social skills they need
to live in a different kind of society, or because they have internalized
conservative ideologies that keep them from creating associations that might
threaten established interests.  People from such a disadvantaged background
might excel in school and get a good job, only to stall in their careers
because they are not building strong networks [4].  People whose careers
stall in this way are often mystified; they are working hard, doing what they
are told, projecting a positive attitude, and generally exercising the skills
that are required to get along in a clientelistic world.  But they lack the
skills of association.  Indeed, they probably lack even a clue that the skills
of association exist.  They might decide that they are being discriminated
against (which does happen, skills or no), or that they really do deserve
the subordinate social status to which they had originally been assigned.
Either would be a tragedy compared to a world in which the necessary skills
are universal. <p>

Intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations have expressed great
enthusiasm for the concept of social capital because it promises concrete
guidance for social development projects, both in poor areas of industrial
countries and in emerging democracies.  Accordingly, these organizations
have spent huge sums in recent years on social capital research, and several
books about social capital have appeared, most famously Putnam's (2000)
own extremely detailed study of the decline of social capital in the United
States [5].  These intuitions are probably right, as far as they go.  But
social reform activities based on building social capital may not succeed,
or may even reinforce existing social inequalities, unless explicit attention
is paid to building the necessary social skills among those segments of the
population that lack them.  You can give people social capital, but it is
better to teach them the skill of making social capital for themselves. <p>

Why does the skill dimension of social capital receive so little press?
It is hard to know for certain.  But experts have generally forgotten what
it is like to be beginners, and people who long ago learned the skills of
association, or who acquired them tacitly through their socialization into the
habitus of professionals, often have a hard time articulating the skills for
others.  This is a general pattern that De Soto (2000) also remarks on in his
analysis of the institutional foundations of economic development: people in
the industrialized countries are so accustomed to a very complex institutional
environment that they literally cannot comprehend life in a society where that
environment is lacking.  Institutions consist first and foremost of social
skills, and what Putnam really saw in Italy was institutions that are present
in the north and not the south [6]. <p>

<strong> 2 Deliberative democracy </strong> <p>

From its earliest days to the present, democracy has always been attended
by a certain myth: citizens gather around in the community meeting-house,
they have an open and rational discussion, they come to a consensus or hold
a pleasant vote, decisions get made, and everyone becomes a better person
in the process.  This powerful legitimating myth is called deliberative
democracy, and it is almost unrelated to the reality of democracy in any time
or place [7].  Of course, the more sophisticated theorists of deliberative
democracy, such as Jurgen Habermas, do not present this picture as a
descriptive theory but as a system of regulative norms.  But even as a
norm, deliberative democracy is so profoundly disconnected from reality that
something must be analytically wrong with it. <p>

Objections to the empirical utility of the myth of deliberative democracy are
not new.  Schudson (1998), for example, presents a wide variety of debunking
arguments from American history [8].  For example, he argues that the
classical New England town meetings were largely staged events in which social
hierarchies were placed on display (1998: 16-19).  And sophisticated, grounded
accounts of democracy in practice are certainly available; see, for example,
Olsen (1983).  My target, then, is not the study of politics as such, but a
relatively narrow tradition, albeit one of great importance historically. <p>

The problems with the myth of deliberative democracy are numerous.  It ignores
the embedding of formal democratic processes in other social structures.
It ignores the behind-the-scenes work, both strategic and tactical, in
which any skilled citizen or politician engages before bringing an issue
to a public forum.  It neglects struggles over the constitutional framework
that is supposed to organize deliberation in any democracy.  And it ignores
the plain fact that many people are afraid to speak at public meetings
(Mansbridge 1980: 60-64, Schudson 1997a: 301-302).  To disagree with the
myth of deliberative democracy is not to endorse the opposite myth of a mass
democracy manipulated by elites [9].  Rather, it argues that the neglected
dimensions of democratic reality belong at the center of any realistic
analysis. <p>

I want to focus on one of these neglected dimensions: the issue of scale
(Calhoun 1998).  Democracy today occurs on a mass scale.  Yet deliberative
democracy takes as its paradigm the local group: the Greek polis, the small
town, or (especially in northern Europe) the workplace.  This attention to
small-group democracy is not entirely wrong, of course.  Dewey, for example,
emphasized the small group because that is where children learn or do not
learn the values of democracy.  Classrooms that tacitly instruct children
in authoritarian values are antidemocratic.  Conservatives in the United
States have emphasized political localism for their own, almost opposite
reasons.  The problem in either case is simply that society is big and
interconnected.  And the problem obviously comes to the fore in a society that
is rapidly becoming globalized and wired, as the issues that citizens debate
in a democracy become themselves increasingly intertwined with the issues that
citizens debate in other places. <p>

Of course, political parties and other structures of mobilization have existed
for centuries, but now the interconnections through which political opinions
and policies are formed are much more complex.  The problem for political
theory is not that political decision-making is moving upward in a hierarchy,
away from local councils and toward a representative central government.
The problem, rather, is that a wired society is making obtrusive the role
of large-scale processes in organizing even very local decision-making.
In a society where communications technologies are poorly developed, even
in the early days of radio and television that provoked the literature on
"mass society", it is possible to conceptualize the influences of large-scale
processes on local decision-making in the nebulous form of "ideology".
Ideologies waft outward from the center, or upward from the supposed masses,
and influence individuals' general cognitive orientations, thus shaping the
attitudes (e.g., democratic or deferential) that they bring to the affairs
of their community.  That, in its dimness, is the picture that centuries of
political theory have left us. <p>

The reality is different.  Listen to real people argue about politics, and
you will generally hear them recite arguments that they got from professional
opinion-makers (politicians, pundits, journalists, scholars, workplace
authorities, and so on) that they happen to agree with (Tarde 1969 [1898]:
312, cited in Schudson 1997a: 304-305).  From the point of view of the
deliberative democracy model, this observation is an embarrassment, if not
an elitist insult.  But it is nothing of the sort.  Coming up with novel
political arguments requires a lot of work.  Human beings are finite, and
nobody has the time or knowledge to invent thought-out arguments on every
issue all by themselves.  Even the professional arguers are mostly pooling
arguments among themselves, for example by refashioning arguments they have
appropriated from others and applying general schemata to particular cases.
Political tendencies can be thought of as industries that generate arguments
to suit their respective interests and strategies, and then deliver those
arguments to their members.  A political tendency, in this sense, requires
an infrastructure (magazines, radio programs, associations, Web sites, think
tanks, and so on), and a political infrastructure is successful if it delivers
the right arguments to the right people at the right time.  This has always
been true.  What is different now is simply the scale and speed with which
debates collectively unfold in a society.  Think, for example, of the titanic
clash of party lines during the American election controversy of 2000 (Agre
2001).  Such episodes make clear that local debates are not constituted only
by their members, or conditioned only by an evolving climate of competing
ideologies, but are embedded -- in great detail and in real time -- in larger
systems (Agre 2002). <p>

Now, it may be argued that this new picture is still deliberative democracy,
only shifted from the local group to what Kroeber (1917) called the
superorganic level.  But that won't do.  Central to deliberative democracy is
a certain picture of the human person: self-possessed, fully rational, engaged
with others, respectful of procedural rules, and so on.  The capacity to
participate in collective decision-making is, for the ideal of deliberative
democracy, the highest state of human life, and people who cannot participate
in collective decision-making (whether because of outside political
constraints or for lack of the relevant skills or attitudes) are not fully
realized human beings.  This is why critiques of the deliberative democracy
theory are taken so seriously: they explode a normative picture of human
development, thereby leaving rudderless whole territories of social and
educational thought.  This is just as well, given the standard theory's
tendency to abstract the citizen away from the individual's concrete identity
and location in the social system (Bohman 1999).  Surely this reassertion of
the collective level in politics diminishes the significance of the individual
and obliterates the case for liberal political freedoms?  Not so.  Recognizing
the embedded nature of political debate does explode a certain story about
those topics, but it does not explode the topics themselves. <p>

What does it do?  To start with, viewing individual citizens as participants
in debates on a collective level does not cast us into the outer darkness
of antihumanist political theories, such as that of Foucault, that view the
human individual as wholly the product of impersonal "discourses".  One could
make some minimal sense of the collective level of public deliberation, for
example, simply by appealing to the metaphor of the "marketplace of ideas"
[10].  Under the marketplace metaphor the individual, no longer centrally
a producer of arguments, is at least a discerning consumer, picking and
choosing through the arguments on offer.  The marketplace metaphor hardly
does justice to the phenomena, given that the advertising and the goods
are nearly the same.  It does not explain the phenomena that are central
to Foucault's theory: the ways that individuals' political participation is
organized through their socialization into social roles such as professions.
It eliminates any sense that the citizen has responsibilities, as opposed
to private rights.  It fails to suggest a satisfactory political analog to
marketplace's regulations against fraud.  And it provides no account of the
actual process of debate, as opposed to the forming of opinion.  But it does
provide something of an existence proof that a theory of collective political
argument does not extinguish individual political agency.  Perhaps, in
analyzing the tensions among the various received theories, we can transcend
the deliberative model and set about reconstructing the values of democracy
in the context of democracy as it is actually lived. <p>

<strong> 3 Civic republicanism </strong> <p>

A republic is the opposite of a monarchy.  A republic, in other words, is
a polity that does not have a king or queen.  This may not seem like much
of a definition, but so long as most of the world was ruled by monarchs --
until well into the twentieth century -- it was a powerful idea.  The very
possibility of a society without a monarch was already well-known to the
Greeks, however, and republicanism is a nearly continuous thread throughout
the history of the West [11]. <p>

In the United States, however, attempts to discuss republicanism are
frustrated by the widespread idea that the United States is a republic because
it is not a democracy.  This unfortunate dichotomy originates with an isolated
mistake in Madison that is representative neither of his philosophy generally
nor of the history of political thought with which he was certainly familiar
(Everdell 2000: 5-6).  In fact, the concepts of republicanism and democracy
are logically unrelated.  Conservativism is rule by an elite, or a stratified
social order administered by that elite, as opposed to democracy, which
is rule by the people.  Republicanism (which can be either conservative or
democratic), for its part, is opposed to monarchy (which also can be either
conservative or, in the case of a constitutional monarchy, democratic).
Conservative philosophy stereotypes democracy as rule by the mob, the erosion
of culture and morals by demotic values, and the leveling of aristocratic
excellence into a general mediocrity (Femia 2001).  Democracy is held to
lead inevitably to tyranny, and rule by elites (which is what conservatives
mean by representative government) is understood as a counterweight to the
mindlessness and degradation of the mass. <p>

Such distinctions having been drawn, we can consider the real ideas of civic
republicanism.  The word "civic" points to the positive agenda for society
that is supposed to occupy the void left behind by the departing monarch.
People are supposed to rule themselves, not be ruled by monarchs, and this
obligation makes certain demands on them.  Good citizens, it is said, place
the welfare of the whole above their own private welfare as individuals.
Of course, stated in that way the principle could mean several things.
It is not, for example, communism.  In particular, it is not an institutional
question, such as whether private property should exist or what other laws
should be passed; rather, it is a norm of political culture.  Citizens, it
is said, should pitch in, be public-spirited, and recognize that their fates
are conjoined.  If the modern ideal of market supremacy were actually true --
that is, if it were even theoretically possible that each individual's welfare
could be reduced to his or her own private property -- then the civic values
of republicanism would not be necessary.  But the market ideal is not true,
and civic republicanism, while not opposed to markets as such, is founded on
its denial. <p>

The history of civic republicanism has mostly been written, like most history,
as a story of leaders.  This is a vestige of the aristocratic worldview,
in which the fate of the polity depends on the personal qualities of the
few who are in charge.  Successful republican government has historically
been regarded as a wonder, and credit for the wonder goes to the leaders
who manage to hold it together.  Or else it goes to institutions such as the
separation of powers that compensate for human nature.  While talented leaders
and well-designed institutions are certainly necessary, however, they are
more nearly products of republican society than producers of it.  In reality,
the success of republican government, like that of nearly any institution,
is founded on ordinary people.  The problem with the philosophy of civic
republicanism, historically, is precisely its overemphasis on the civic
values of placing the good of the whole above one's own.  Civic-mindedness
is certainly valuable, but a preoccupation with civic values as the central
condition of republicanism speaks too much of a polemical defense against
conservative pessimism about humanity, and too little of the actual practical
work of republican self-government. <p>

Once again -- and there is a pattern here -- what is missing is a clear
conception of the individual citizen [12].  The word "citizen", like many
words in politics, is unfortunate because it has two independent meanings:
it is either a bundle of rights (such as the rights enjoyed by citizens of
a country versus people who are in the country on visas or illegally) or
a bundle of responsibilities (voting, being informed about public issues,
engaging with fellow citizens, expressing views) and the construction of
self that goes with them.  The civic republican tradition, which has not
(unlike democracy) been centrally concerned with spreading the rights of
citizenship as widely as possible, has understood citizenship mainly in the
latter sense, as a bundle of responsibilities.  In many cases, citizenship
has been understood as love of country, respect for the flag, civility in
debate, and other injunctions that, while perhaps necessary, suggest more
a fear of citizens rather than respect for them [13].  With rare exception,
republicanism's understanding of the skills of citizenship has been
superficial and formalistic.  It is highly developed in some areas, for
example in its inheritance from the tradition of rhetoric.  It has also
drawn on the lengthy tradition of advice manuals for rulers (as opposed to
citizens).  But it provides little guidance about the great majority of social
interactions that organize political life outside the giving of speeches. <p>

Republicanism also has a deeper meaning, one that begins to connect with the
other themes that I have been developing.  Republicanism is not simply the
absence of monarchs -- that is its negative meaning.  It is also the capacity
for collective self-government.  Obeying a monarch is not simply a consciously
chosen method of running a society; it is also an existential condition.
No form of government is feasible in the long run unless the people regard it
as legitimate, and the only way to legitimize monarchy is through internalized
habits of deference -- that is, through the deeply rooted belief that one
is, by nature, inferior to the monarch, and by extension to the hierarchy
of authorities that God Himself, through the agency of His monarch, has
instituted.  Republican conservatism is, in historical terms, a transitional
form of society in which deference to authority remains but is legitimized
by an abstract appeal to tradition rather than to the monarch.  The historical
significance of the United States, and its greatest contribution to the
world, is that it broke with deference as an organizing principle of political
culture (Shalhope 1990, Wood 1992).  From the cultural revolution of the
1790s, through the populist eras of the early and late 19th century, through
the labor movement of the Depression to the civil rights era and the new
social movements that followed it, the history of the United States has been
a story of progress: the progressive undoing of internalized deference and
the progressive realization of democratic republican values.  Overcoming the
habits of deference means realizing, at the deepest level, that one can, and
deserves to, participate in determining one's own fate.  Only when the lights
go on in individuals' minds will they take the initiative to fulfill --
indeed, to invent -- the promise of citizenship. <p>

<strong> 4 Machiavellianism </strong> <p>

These considerations on republicanism provide a convenient occasion to discuss
the most important modern analysis of social skill and its role in society,
that of Fligstein (2001).  Fligstein observes that social theory, despite its
endless concern with the relationship of agency to social structure, has been
remarkably unconcerned with either the nature or the substance of the skills
that social agents employ.  He has sought to remedy that omission by sketching
a theory of social skill that draws on ideas from symbolic interactionism
[14]. <p>

Fligstein's starting point is the concept of a social field, which is
roughly speaking an institution in which various social groups contest their
respective interests.  The social skills he describes are those of a "skilled
actor" or "institutional enterpreneur" who negotiates the interactions between
powerful and powerless groups within the social field in order to arrive
at a set of rules to govern their future relationships.  Social fields, he
observes, tend to be highly stable.  The opportunities for a skilled actor
to change things tend to emerge in periods of crisis, especially when the
territory of the social field is being invaded by some other social field.  In
those situations, the skilled actor can employ a wide range of interpersonal
strategies, maintaining the appearance of community-mindedness by manipulating
rules and tailoring communication to the beliefs and identities of each
particular audience.  Having thereby mediated the emergence of a new system
of rules, the skilled actor must once again stabilize the field by instilling
in the field's participants a new set of habits. <p>

Fligstein's theory restores a missing piece to social theory.  It does so,
however, through a striking reinvention.  Although he does not seem aware
of it, Fligstein's theory is isomorphic, and in remarkable detail, to that
of Machiavelli (whom he mentions only in passing, when observing that the
skilled actor tries not to appear Machiavellian) [15].  The skilled actor
in Fligstein's account is analogous to Machiavelli's prince.  The field is
the Renaissance city-state.  The powerful groups are the oligarchic families,
and the powerless groups are the populo, mainly the guilds.  The powerful
groups/oligarchic families must negotiate among themselves, lest their rule
collapse into factionalism.  The various groups among the powerless/populo
must also maintain solidarity to have any chance of curtailing the rule of
the powerful.  The "rules" that govern a field are the laws of the city-state.
The field/city-state alternates in each theory between stasis and crisis;
the crisis can be caused by internal dynamics but is more often caused by
invasion.  It is very hard to change the rule of a field/city-state while it
is static.  The would-be prince must wait for a crisis.  The field/city-state
is ruled not directly by the ruler, but through the mediation of a set of
habits that the field/city-state instills in its participants/citizens.  This,
after all, is what the fifteenth century meant by republicanism.  The elements
that Fligstein takes from symbolic interactionism have been known since
ancient Greece as rhetoric.  The prince/skilled actor fashions appearances
and manipulates rules/laws, operating largely by flattery.  And he is very
concerned to be seen as acting in the community interest, whether he is or
not. <p>

The one important divergence between the theories comes at the point where,
each says, the prince/skilled actor's attempt to institute a new order
can fail.  The main motivation of Machiavelli and his readers is to prevent
political crisis from producing a tyrant.  For that reason, Machiavelli
advises the prince to resort to violence when necessary to institute
his new republican order.  Fligstein and his readers are not motivated
by the danger of a tyrant, at least not consciously, and that may explain
why Fligstein observes much more dispassionately than Machiavelli that the
prince/skilled actor's attempts can fail.  He is not clear on what happens
next, though from the logic of his argument I would assume either that the
old order limps along in a reduced form, or else that the field is subsumed
by its neighbors. <p>

My purpose here is not to criticize Fligstein, who has done social theory
a service by reviving a theme that was once central to Western theories
of politics as a whole.  Fligstein's accomplishment speaks volumes about
the immense reorientation of political inquiry from a practical art to
a distanced, abstract, and only marginally applicable would-be science.
Even Marx, who was emphatic about the unity of theory and practice, provided
his readers with almost no concrete instruction in the arts of politics
(Habermas 1997: 51).  It is time to repair the damage.  Yet Machiavelli's
theory, even when updated with modern social-theoretic vocabulary, is not the
theory of social skill that a modern democracy needs.  Machiavelli, like the
great majority of authors of guides to practical skills before the modern era,
wrote only for an elite.  He presupposes that only one individual possesses
the skills that he writes about.  Everyone else is treated passively as
raw material for the manipulations of the prince.  This is not a theory of
democracy.  It is not even a theory of republicanism.  What would a polity
be like in which everyone had advanced social skills, and what would the
ideal skills be like for a polity in which political skills are widespread?
<p>

<strong> 5 Citizenship </strong> <p>

The United States is a democratic republic, and it needs a democratic
republican theory of the skills of citizenship [16].  Although such a theory
cannot be simple, elements of it can be found in the correctives that I have
offered to the ideas of social capital, deliberative democracy, and civic
republicanism.  What is needed is something like a manual -- a how-to, that
most American of genres.  The central problem that the citizen faces is how
to participate meaningfully in a society of hundreds of millions.  It is
a common and reasonable question: how does my voice count?  Some theorists,
in the tradition of Downs (1957), actually seem to revel in the difficulty,
making it seem mysterious that anyone should even find it worthwhile to vote,
much less involve themselves in the minutiae of public issues.  That won't do.
<p>

Other theorists point more reasonably to the institutions of "civil society"
that mediate between individuals and the state [17].  Perhaps the average
citizen cannot have much effect on national legislation, but having an effect
on the policy positions of one's profession, party, church, union, political
club, interest group, or civic association is more imaginable.  The concept
of civil society has its weaknesses; it works better for some societies than
for others [18].  But at least it provides a point of departure for a serious
consideration of the practical work of politics in a complex modern society.
<p>

From the arguments above, it follows that a how-to for democratic republican
citizenship would have several elements, including skills for building social
capital and participating in the collective production and circulation of
political arguments.  I cannot provide such a how-to here, but I can sketch
perhaps the central idea that is undreamt in the philosophies that I have been
describing.  That idea is as follows: it is central to the political process
that individual citizens, in their public personae, are able to associate
themselves with issues.  Citizens, whether politicians or activists, make
their political careers in entrepreneurial fashion by identifying issues
that are coming to prominence, researching and analyzing them, staking out
public positions on them, and building social networks of other citizens
who have associated themselves with related issues, especially those whose
positions are ideologically compatible [19].  Not only this kind of issue
entrepreneurship central to the making of public policy, but it is also
central to the "politics", in the broad sense, of nearly every institutional
field, from industries to research fields, from bureaucracies to artistic
circles, from professions to social movements.  Ideologies, in their practical
political aspect, are designed to rationalize and cement coalitions among
issue entrepreneurs who have staked out a wide range of issues, and the
social networks whose construction the ideologies facilitate then become the
connective tissue of political movements. <p>

This process is fractal: its logic is essentially the same on the global
stage as on the national, and it is essentially the same on a regional stage
as on a local.  What is more, it is essentially the same within a wide variety
of institutional contexts.  Thus, individuals can stake out issues and build
political networks within their professions, their churches, their unions,
their industries, or their political organizations.  The politics of the
local PTA is, in this regard, largely isomorphic to the politics of a national
political party.  Issue entrepreneurship, in this sense, is a pervasive
organizing logic of a democratic republican society, and not the preserve
of the social movement leader-hero or the occasional prince.  The key
is that political personae, political networks, and political issues, on
every scale, are all constructed in the same process.  This network among
individuals who have publicly associated themselves with particular political
issues -- drawing on a mathematical metaphor (Birkhoff 1967), call it an issue
lattice -- has four dimensions: <p>

 * in the vertical dimension, individuals who stake out a given issue on the
national level will generally network with those who stake out the same issue
on either the global or the regional level; <p>

 * in the geographic dimension, individuals who stake out issues in a
given geographic jurisdiction will generally network with their counterparts
in other jurisdictions; <p>

 * in the institutional dimension, individuals who stake out a given issue
within one institutional context will generally network with those who stake
out the same issue in other institutions; and <p>

 * in the ideological dimension, individuals who stake out ideologically
related positions on different issues in similar institutional locations will
generally network with one another. <p>

This four-dimensional lattice structure is the essence of civil society
[20].  Yet, note how different it is from the three concepts that I described
at the outset.  First of all, the four-dimensional issue lattice is not
simply a large quantity of social network connections, but a very definite
network structure.  Nor does it require high levels of trust, but rather
a large number of particular negotiations and a great deal of issue-by-issue
coalition-building stabilized by ideology.  Above all, the issue lattice
is sufficiently complex in its detailed workings that it will never emerge
without high levels of political skill diffused throughout the society.
From this perspective, the crucial type of capital that a society needs
is not social networks but social skill; the rest, social networks included,
will follow from the entrepreneurial energy of individuals and the cognitive
and informational demands of republican politics.  Social capital, on this
theory, does not depend crucially on the founding of associations, in the
sense of formal organizations among nominally equal citizens.  Associations
are usefully viewed as epiphenomena of the more fundamental skill of forming
an issue lattice [21]. <p>

Secondly, the four-dimensional issue lattice could hardly be more
different than the idealized picture of deliberative democracy.  Political
decision-making, it turns out, is embedded in long-term relationships.
Its center is ideology, not the making of particular political decisions.
Whereas the deliberative democracy theory portrays every citizen as having
the same relationship to every issue, in reality citizens tend to specialize
in particular issues.  This phenomenon follows naturally from the cognitive
limits of citizens in complex societies, but it also follows from demands of
the long-term construction of public political personae.  Individuals fashion
themselves into "brand names" by articulating positions on particular issues
that will attract coherent groups of followers, whether as organization
members, contributors, subscribers, volunteers, or voters.  It follows that
a central task for a citizen is to organize the circulation of arguments
on an issue, both within the four-dimensional issue lattice and to the
individuals who subscribe to the citizen's position.  Of course, deliberative
meetings still occur.  The point is that these meetings are thoroughly
embedded in longer-term, multiply-scaled political processes that extend
far beyond the walls of any given meeting-house. <p>

Finally, specifying the actual practice of citizenship shifts the focus of
civic republicanism from civic values to the skills of civic life.  Civic
values are no doubt necessary, but their exercise is heavily embedded in the
structure of relationships.  This embedding helps to make civic values less
mysterious: they become partly reducible to the negotiations through which
coalitions are built, for example in the segmentary politics that continually
ripples up and down the vertical dimension of the issue lattice.  More
importantly, the success of republican government no longer seems to depend
on the altruism of civic selflessness, and instead to depend on the diverse
incentives to pursue civic careers [22] (Habermas 1997: 59).  Of course,
a polity of global scope without powerful norms of civic selflessness may
no longer be republican in any recognizable sense.  The question is not
trivial: one must determine whether the classical ideal of the self-governing
city-state is the very definition of republic, or whether that ideal
was simply one means, limited by the available technology and the unequal
distribution of entrepreneurial social skills, to a more fundamentally
republican end. <p>

The operation of issue lattices is, then, closely tied to the technologies
of information and communication, and these technologies become especially
important when we consider the democratic aspects of citizenship [23].
Historically, theories of political networks have focused their attention on
the highest echelons of interest group politics, for example in the endlessly
shifting alliances among interest groups in Washington (e.g., Laumann
and Knoke 1989).  In fact, similar issue-networking processes take place
throughout the society, and civil society can be strengthened if access
to the skills and technologies of building networks around political issues
are further democratized.  This includes the curricula of civics classes,
of course, which ought to teach the practical skills of political organizing.
But it should also include the curricula of professional schools, the
citizenship tests given to immigrants, and many other contexts where the
practical foundations of a democratic republic can be reinforced [24].  In
particular, the issue entrepreneurship theory argues that the main democratic
potential of technologies like the Internet does not rest in their ability
to support deliberation (Agre 2002: 311-312).  Instead, it rests mainly in
their ability to support the work of issue entrepreneurs: identifying and
researching emerging issues, distributing analyses of current events to an
audience, organizing events, and networking with other entrepreneurs in the
issue lattice. <p>

Politics has been understood since the Greeks as a practical skill, and so
it may seem surprising that the most central skill of politics has remained
largely unarticulated across centuries.  But in hindsight it is not surprising
at all.  Civilization is the story of the human struggle to emerge from the
moral darkness of conservatism, to turn the lights on in individual minds and
overcome the habits of deference that turn people into machines.  Democratic
republicanism is a story not of perfection but of progress.  It is a story
that is written afresh in every era, and in every life.  Technology provides
most of the organizing themes for that story in our own era.  But technology
is not central; what is central are the choices that we make, each of us,
in laying claim to the rights and responsibilities of citizenship in our own
lives. <p>

<strong> Notes </strong> <p>

[1] On the concept of social capital and its applications, see Dasgupta and
Serageldin (2000), Grootaert and Van Bastelaer (2002), Lin (2001), Putnam
(2002), Rotberg (2001), and Woolcock (1998).  Fine's (2001) bibliography
is invaluable.  On the background in Tocqueville see Hadenius (2001) and
Mansfield and Winthrop (2000). <p>

[2] For critical discussion of Putnam's argument see Edwards and Foley (1998),
Levi (1996), and Sabetti (1996). <p>

[3] For Loasby (1999: 46), by contrast, social capital is located not in
networks but in practical skills:

<blockquote>
Institutions are a response to uncertainty.  They are patterns acquired from
others which guide individual actions, even when these actions are quite
unconnected with any other person.  They economise on the scarce resource
of cognition, by providing us with ready-made anchors of sense, ways of
partitioning the space of representations, premises for decisions, and
bounds within which we can be rational -- or imaginative.  They constitute
a capital stock of other people's reuseable knowledge, although, like all
knowledge, this is fallible.  In fact, just as Marshall recognized the
importance for firms of supplementing their own internal organisation with
an external organisation, so each of us finds life much more manageable
if we supplement our own internally organised cognition with the externally
organised social capital which is the accretion of many other people's
cognition.  We are therefore not restricted to our own apparatus of
classification in trying to make sense of our surroundings.
</blockquote>

Somewhat similarly, Ostrom (2000) locates social capital in the governance
systems that local communities evolve for managing common resources such as
water.  A significant difference between Putnam and these authors is that,
for Putnam, social capital is sufficiently generic that it can readily be
transferred from one institutional setting to another.  For Loasby and Ostrom,
by contrast, social capital consists of concrete practical skills that are
embedded in particular institutions. <p>

[4] For extensive empirical evidence that the structure of social networks
affects career advancement, see Burt (1995) and Lin, Cook, and Burt (2001).
For background see Rauch and Casella (2000) and Smelser and Swedberg (1994).
<p>

[5] This new work makes a stronger empirical case for claims that Putnam
originally put forth in his celebrated but controversial article alleging
a decline of social capital in the United States (Putnam 1995).  For critical
analysis of Putnam's original argument see Schudson (1996). <p>

[6] Cohen and Fields (2000) argue that Putnam's theory of social capital
as a generalized disposition toward association does not explain the economic
success of Silicon Valley, with its high levels of network-building and
near-zero levels of civic engagement.  Instead, they argue that Silicon
Valley's social capital cannot be dissociated from its unique ensemble of
institutions.  Those institutions include the great research universities,
government research and development policies, venture capital, stock options,
and the specific nature of the computer industry.  The social capital of
other economic and political regions, even ones as superficially similar as
the Route 128 technology corridor near Boston, may well be embedded in quite
different institutions. <p>

Krishna (2000) also connects the concept of social capital to that
of institutions.  He usefully subdivides social capital into two kinds:
institutional capital, which is the collection of formal mechanisms
for organizing activity with which a given community has experience,
and relationship capital, which is the collection of established personal
relationships among the individuals in a community.  The two forms of social
capital are complementary, and each is necessary for a strong and flexible
social system.  This way of defining the concepts is somewhat problematic:
institutions comprise more than just formal rules, and relationships are
generally organized by institutions.  Even so, Krishna's analysis does
provide one way of overcoming the industrial world's inattention to the
institutional foundations of development. <p>

See also Hoff and Stiglitz (2001) on the role of institutions in development
and Bellah (2000) and Berman (1997) on institutions in civil society. <p>

[7] Very unusually in the literature, Mansbridge (1980) actually found and
studied two polities that approximate the deliberative myth.  She emphasizes
the ongoing work of maintaining relationships outside of the venues of formal
decision-making, and she argues that the ideal of deliberation requires the
citizens to have the same interests.  For both these reasons, she concludes
that the deliberative ideal is inapplicable to large-scale politics.  See also
Dryzek and Berejikian (1993), who use interviews and quantitative analysis
to reconstruct citizens' conception of democracy and the deliberative
process. <p>

On the idea that participation in politics makes one a better person, see
Gutmann and Thompson (1996) and Mansbridge (1999).  Although Mansbridge argues
that the idea in its full-blown form is recent, elements of it are much older.
<p>

On the concept of deliberative democracy generally, see Bohman and Rehg
(1997), Dryzek (2002), Elster (1998), Gutmann and Thompson (1996), Koh
and Slye (1999), and Nino (1996).  On the related but distinct concept of
participatory democracy, see Pateman (1970).  Of course, these theories of
deliberative democracy vary, and not all of them subscribe to every element
of the myth that I have described.  The overall picture, though, is quite
consistent.  For diverse criticisms of Habermas' theory of deliberative
democracy in particular, with Habermas' informative response, see Calhoun
(1992). <p>

[8] See also Schudson (1997a, 1997b). <p>

[9] It is, however, to acknowledge somewhat ruefully the empirical accuracy
in most democratic polities to date of what Etzioni-Halevy (1993) calls the
demo-elite theory.  According to this theory, the feasibility of democratic
government depends on the elites of many different institutional fields
(business, education, the arts, and so on) having enough resources under their
command to maintain their autonomy in relation to the state.  If the state
is able to undermine the autonomy of these institutions, then the result will
be some form of corporatism, or worse.  In a society where the social skills
of association are unevenly distributed, being in essence restricted to
the various elites, this conclusion most likely follows.  Whether the autonomy
of sectoral elites is a significant consideration in a society where political
skills are universally taught in grade school is another matter. <p>

[10] The phrase "marketplace of ideas" is widely attributed to John Stuart
Mill's <i>On Liberty</i> (1974 [1859]), but as Gordon (1997: 235) observes,
"[t]his metaphor does not come from Mill's own text ... and quite to the
contrary ... does not reflect accurately Mill's views on free speech".
The metaphor is also often falsely attributed to Milton's <i>Areopagitica</i>.
It is best known from its use in Oliver Wendell Holmes' dissent in Abrams
v. US, 250 US 616 (1919).  Yet even there the precise phrase, "marketplace
of ideas", does not occur.  Holmes in fact says: "the ultimate good desired
is better reached by free trade in ideas" and "the best test of truth is the
power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market"
(both at 630).  The text is available at

in the founding of the United States, see Appleby (1984), Pocock (1975), Rahe

[13] For a contemporary version of this, see Sandel (1996). <p>

[14] Fligstein (1997) presents an earlier version of the theory. <p>

[15] See, for example, Machiavelli's <i>Discourses on Livy</i>, Book 1,
Chapter 9.  The convergence of Fligstein's theory with the account of
Machiavelli in Coleman (2000) is especially striking. <p>

[16] For a rare discussion of the role of social skill in democratic society,
see Elkin and Soltan (1999).  On democratic republicanism see, e.g., Baker
(2001). <p>

[17] Although the concept of civil society is arguably ancient, its
extraordinary contemporary revival begins with Keane (1988a, 1988b,
1998).  See also Alexander (1998), Cohen and Arato (1992), Gellner (1994),
Hall (1995), and Seligman (1992).  For a forcefully analytical argument
for the central role of civil society in the contemporary trend toward
democratization, see Gill (2000).  For historical perspectives see Black
(1984), Ehrenberg (1999), and Ferguson (1995).  Seligman (1995) argues that
the concept of civil society, with its emphasis on the citizen's private
attributes, is incompatible with republicanism, with its emphasis on the
public self.  The concept was also employed for rather different purposes
by American conservative intellectuals in their campaign for welfare reform
in the 1990s; see Berger and Neuhaus (1996), Eberly (2000), and Mansfield
and Winthrop (2000). <p>

[18] For comparative perspectives, see Chambers and Kymlicka (2001), Hann
and Dunn (1996), Howell and Pearce (2001), Kaviraj and Khilnani (2001), and
Schechter (1999).  For an especially forceful critique, see Comaroff and
Comaroff (2000). <p>

[19] It has often been observed that experts, for example the members of
professions, play distinctive cognitive roles in society (e.g., Bohman 1999).
My point here, though, is more general: a democratic republic will make
available a repertoire of institutions and action-forms that enable any
citizen, whether formally credentialed or not, to pursue a career as an issue
entrepreneur. <p>

On business entrepreneurship see Swedberg (2000) and Casson (2000).  On
entrepreneurship in the university context see Clark (1998).  In the context
of cultural institutions see DiMaggio (1982a, 1982b).  In the context of
social movements see McCarthy and Zald (1987) and Spinosa, Flores, and Dreyfus
(1997).  McCarthy and Zald (1987: 18) use the phrase "issue entrepreneurs".
Their emphasis, however, is on movements generally, and they do not develop
a general theory of the issue entrepreneur as an individual, or of issue
entrepreneurship as a form of social practice. <p>

Political scientists also use the phrase to refer to politicians who build
electoral coalitions by pioneering new political issues.  Schneider and
Teske (1992), for example, draw out the analogy between politicians' issue
entrepreneurship and the economic theory of business entrepreneurship.

In his lecture on "Politics as a Vocation", Weber (1946 [1919]: 86, 102-105,
109) describes the professional politician as an entrepreneur.  In each case,
though, he is referring to the methods that politicians (and not citizens
generally) use to turn political activity into a paying job.  He also briefly
discusses the business entrepreneur's role in politics, or lack thereof (85,
100).

[20] In Burt's (1995) terms, citizens establish places for themselves in the
issue lattice by filling structural holes, that is, networking among diverse
individuals among whom the newly emerging issue creates opportunities for
arbitrage, agenda-setting, and other forms of entrepreneurial gain. <p>

Like the issue lattice theory, Lin's (2001: 36-39) theory of social capital
asserts that the social system is organized as a hierarchical social network.
But Lin offers little explanation of how individuals attain their particular
locations on one stratum or another except to say that they invest effort in
establishing new social links with people on the strata above them. <p>

[21] The theoretical consequences of this point may be considerable.  Even
as it provides a substantive theory of the social mechanisms that underlie
civil society, the theory of issue entrepreneurship also undermines to some
degree the very concept of civil society as something distinct from, and
set against, the institutions of the state.  The pervasively fractal nature
of issue entrepreneurship implies that the same social logic organizes
political processes in every institution, including both state and non-state
institutions.  What is more, the issue lattice of a functioning democratic
republic knits the social networks of the state into those of nearly every
other sphere of society.  Although it is commonly held that democracy requires
a robust civil society (see note 17), it is entirely possible that democracy
in fact requires a robust political culture -- a culture in which the skills
of issue entrepreneurship are thoroughly ingrained in the language, values,
and action forms of everyday life.  Perhaps that kind of political culture
must satisfy additional institutional constraints, such as a distinction and
opposition between civil society and the state.  But before the question can
be usefully asked, categories such as association and civil society need to
be rethought.  As Habermas (1997: 54) aptly notes, "as an organizational form,
an association lacks the complexity necessary to structure the social fabric
as a whole". <p>

Arguing from a conservative perspective, however, Zijdervald (2000) asserts
that social networks are replacing the institutions within which people
formerly found their positions in society.  He worries, though, that mere
networks may be incapable of serving the socializing, value-instilling
function of traditional institutions.  Similarly, Sandel (1984: 93) argues
that "[b]y the mid- to late twentieth century ... the [United States] proved
too vast a scale across which to cultivate the shared self-understandings
necessary to community in the formative, or constitutive sense.  And so the
gradual shift, in our practices and institutions, from a public philosophy
of common purpose to one of fair procedures, from a politics of good to a
politics of right, from the national republic to the procedural republic".
<p>

[22] Similarly, March and Olsen (1995) warn against a conflation between the
quite distinct concepts of community membership and civic identity.

[23] See Agre (2002); Barney (2000); Becker and Wehner (2001); Buchstein
(1997); Florini (2000); Hacker and van Dijk (2001); Hague and Loader
(1999); Hoff, Horrocks, and Tops (2000); Netanel (2000); and Norris (2001).
On the civic networking movement see Doctor and Dutton (1999), Friedland
(1996), Schuler (1996), and Tambini (2001). <p>

[24] Berkowitz (1996) argues that proposals for deliberative democracy
unfairly tilt the political playing field towards the very sorts of
sophisticated and articulate individuals who tend to support them, and a
similar objection might be raised to my own proposals here.  In each case,
though, the obvious response is the same: you cannot have a democratic
republic without an educated citizenry, and one purpose of a democratic
republican political theory is to sketch the syllabus for the necessary
education. <p>
