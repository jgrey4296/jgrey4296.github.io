Research on the role of information and communications technologies
in social change has become a global industry.  As usual, we in the
United States assume that we lead the field.  Publications that have
appeared in the last year, however, make it clear that the leaders
are actually in Europe.  Below I've prepared an annotated bibliography
of recent European research.  First, however, let me offer some rough
generalizations.  Research on the "information society" in the United
States and Europe can be compared and contrasted in many ways: <p>

 * Americans talk about "the Internet" but use the term broadly
and inconsistently; we like the term because it connotes revolution
and because we invented it.  Europeans talk about "information and
communications technologies" or "ICT's", a much broader and more
accurate term that includes areas like wireless where the Europeans
are ahead, but also one that connotes bureaucracy and does not provoke
the post-and-telecom bureaucracies. <p>

 * American research is organized largely through individual graduate
students' thesis projects, although large multi-site projects are
becoming more common; European research is organized largely through
collective research projects that are closely regulated by funding
agencies.  This is one of many reasons why the American university
system works better than the European systems, and why European social
research is better integrated with institutions outside the university
than American social research. <p>

 * American research is divided between NSF, which allocates a few
crumbs to social research once the networks and databases get their
millions, and private foundations, which increasingly (though not
exclusively) do their own research, usually driven directly by their
policy agendas, rather than funding others.  In Europe, by contrast,
the European Union is committed to research on social aspects of
computing, which is thoroughly integrated into its policy-making
process.  Remarkably, all of the major funding agencies, American and
European alike, are run by intelligent people. <p>

 * The American research is more creative; the European research is
better grounded in institutional reality.  The Americans are stronger
at hard economics, the Europeans at institutional economics.  The
Americans are stronger at engineering design, the Europeans at design
methods derived from the arts and from democratic theory.  Americans
are stronger at ethnography; Europeans are stronger at studies of
industrial regions.  Americans are stronger at organizational studies;
Europeans are stronger at studies of broad social trends.  American
theory is more fashion-driven; European theory is more traditional.
American research is preoccupied with cyber hype -- propagating it or
refuting it; European research is preoccupied with the policy agenda
of the European Union. <p>

 * American research struggles endlessly to get free of technological
determinism, for example in the concept of "cyberspace" as a separate
realm and a revolutionary break with the past whose laws are dictated
simply by the workings of the machinery.  Europeans have less of
this problem.  They talk about an "information society", which is
still somewhat deterministic but does not denote a discontinuous
break.  The Europeans produce vast, boring policy documents in which
every issue gets its place.  Americans hate these documents, but in
many ways American thinking, for all its creativity, is fragmented
as a result. <p>

 * Americans have a more evolved infrastructure, so they have more
complex technology-driven social practices to study.  This is largely
because the US scientific leadership, led by ARPA but including the
top ranks of NSF, the major supercomputer labs, and IBM, is extremely
intelligent and well-organized.  (Silicon Valley makes noise, but it
does not set agendas for technological development.)  The Europeans
are better than the United States at setting standards.  They are also
better at industrial policy, for example supporting industrial regions
like the wireless industry in Scandinavia.  (Our industrial policy
is to hire big professors and let them start companies.  This works.
But otherwise, lots of American jurisdictions have shallow and
wasteful ideas about how to get a Silicon Valley of their own.)  So
the European research is more driven by industrial agendas.  In the
United States you get digital library research, which Silicon Valley
has barely heard of even though it's concentrated in California; and
in Europe you get research on people using wireless.  Wireless is
changing the world now; digital libraries will change the world in ten
years; both require social research if they're going to be done well.
<p>

 * The United States and Europe both have great public concern with
the impact of new technologies on social equality, but the Europeans
have a stronger conceptualization of the issues.  The American
language of a "digital divide" and "information haves and have-nots"
hardly names the problem, much less pointing toward a solution.  The
European language of "social inclusion and exclusion", while sounding
like fingernails on a chalkboard to many people, at least names the
problem in an actionable way and places ICTs into a broader context.
Europeans will no doubt lecture me on the inadequacy of the European
policy response to date, but my only point is the comparison to the US.
<p>

 * Reports on the American research are hard to get hold of because so
many are published in new journals that few libraries carry; reports
on the European research are hard to get hold of because so many are
written for granting agencies. <p>

 * Final caveat: Just to be clear, I'm not saying that all European
research on the information society is valuable or that all American
research is bad.  To the contrary, the EU system produces a lot of
vacuous consultant reports along with the legitimate work, and much
high-quality research is being done in the US.  I am also glossing
over cases that don't fit into my Europe-versus-America framework:
transatlantic collaborations, globalized technology companies,
Americans working in Europe and vice versa, conferences such as
Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) that exist in communicating
American and European versions, and so on. <p>

With those rough generalizations out of the way, here is an annotated
bibliography of European research on the information society.  I
have focused on new books (rather than older works, journal articles,
or book chapters), with a few exceptions.  This list is by no means
complete, and it could surely be doubled. <p>

Cristiano Antonelli, New information technology and the evolution of
the industrial organisation of the production of knowledge, in Stuart
Macdonald and John Nightingale, eds, Information and Organization: A
Tribute to the Work of Don Lamberton, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999.
This is a frighteningly sophisticated theoretical account of the
role of networked information services in the evolution of industry
structure.  It emerges from a large community of people with economics
training working in management schools who study the interaction
between technical architecture and industry structure.  This is
an area where good work is being done in the United States as well,
though on this specific topic Antonelli's article in a class by itself.
<p>

Joan Bliss, Roger Saljo, and Paul Light, eds, Learning Sites: Social
and Technological Resources for Learning, Oxford: Pergamon, 1999.
This is an interesting collection of work about learning technology
based on the educational theories of the Russian psychologist L. S.
Vygotsky.  (Good research on educational technology in this tradition
is also happening in the US as well, for example at UC San Diego.) <p>

Susanne Bodker, Morten Kyng, and Kjeld Schmidt, eds, Proceedings of
the Sixth European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work,
Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1999.  Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW),
as the name implies, is the field that develops technical tools to
support cooperative work.  It turns out that so-called groupware tools
fail without a strong understanding of the social processes of group
work, and so CSCW research must integrate its technical and social
sides to a greater degree than perhaps any other field.  This is hard
because technologists and social scientists live on different planets.
It can make for conferences where the two sides stand at opposite
sides of the room, wondering how to interact.  Both the Americans and
the Europeans try to overcome the differences, but the Europeans have
had more success. <p>

Gro Bjerknes, Pelle Ehn, and Morten Kyng, eds, Computers and
Democracy: A Scandinavian Challenge, Aldershot, UK: Avebury, 1987.
I'm including this book even though it's old by now.  It is one of
the first manifestos of the participatory design movement that got
started in Norway in the 1970's, and that has subsequently become
institutionalized throughout Scandinavia.  It began with projects
to include labor unions in the design of workplace technologies,
and it has generalized into a whole culture of design for involving
users in the design process.  This means contending with the problem
that "users don't know what they want", and with the consequences
of bringing the inevitably political nature of design to the surface
in formal democratic design processes.  I'm not clear why there have
been so few edited volumes or major theoretical works on participatory
design in the last few years.  Research in the field is hardly dead,
as the proceedings of the Participatory Design Conference makes clear.
It's more that the Scandinavians take participatory design for granted
and move forward from there. <p>

Hans-Joachim Braczyk, Gerhard Fuchs, and Hans-Georg Wolf, eds,
Multimedia and Regional Economic Restructuring, London: Routledge,
1999.  This is perhaps the strongest collection of studies of the
impact of information technology on economic geography. <p>

Mark Casson, Information and Organization: A New Perspective on the
Theory of the Firm, Clarendon Press, 1997.  This is a very original
theoretical analysis of the place of information in industrial
organization.  Economics worldwide is dominated by the neoclassical
school, which tends to assume away most problems of information.
But the UK is home to a number of interesting heterodox economists,
and Casson is especially interesting because he moves easily between
the neoclassical and institutional camps.  In this book his starting
point is the observation that every organization is an intermediary
between individual workers and individual consumers.  So in a sense
every organization's existence needs to be justified, and one way
to justify an intermediary is in terms of its role in gathering and
processing information.  A few simple observations along these lines
generate a tremendous variety of interesting consequences, or at least
interesting hypotheses. <p>

Claudio U. Ciborra, ed, From Control to Drift: The Dynamics of
Corporate Information Infrastructures, Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 2000.  This is a project from Oslo about the organizational
realities of information technology standards.  They draw on network
economics and actor-network theory in some extended case studies of
frustrated standardization projects in various European companies.
Any large organization will have a legacy of heterogeneous systems,
and transitions to new standards such as the Internet are inevitably
political and logistical messes. <p>

Sally Criddle, Lorcan Dempsey, and Richard Heseltine, eds, Information
Landscapes for a Learning Society, London: Library Association, 1999.
The British are leaders in rethinking information services in the
new digital world, for example by integrating library services with
instructional media services and the like in the university context.
This book gathers reports on initiatives from (mostly) British library
people. <p>

Ken Ducatel, Juliet Webster, and Werner Herrmann, eds, The Information
Society in Europe: Work and Life in an Age of Globalization, Rowman
and Littlefield, 2000.  This volume is a good sample of the sort of
critically minded research on the information society that happens
under the umbrella of the European Union without being by any means
dictated in its substance by the bureaucracy.  It has many outstanding
qualities, starting with its clear grasp of the many-dimensional
concrete reality of a functioning information society on planet Earth.
Topics include regional development, new organizational forms, the
labor market, and ICT applications in health, education and politics.
<p>

Anthony Dunne, Hertzian Tales: Electronic Products, Aesthetic
Experience and Critical Design, Art Books, 2000.  This book comes
from a thesis at the Royal College of Art in London, which is
one of the most interesting sources of artistically minded design
of digital products.  It indulges more in fashion-theory than I
probably would; it takes Baudrillard seriously in a way that I can't.
It is challenging and often confounding.  But it is also a serious
and sustained inquiry into the meanings of digital products, and
particularly the strange problem of the meaning of an object that
gives physical form to information. <p>

William H. Dutton, Society on the Line: Information Politics in the
Digital Age, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.  The author is
American, but the book is a summary and synthesis of research done
in the UK under the sponsorship of the Economic and Social Research
Council (ESRC), which has sponsored a great deal of high-quality
work, most recently the Virtual Society? project led by Steve Woolgar
(see <http://virtualsociety.sbs.ox.ac.uk/>).  (I hear that another,
similar large-group ESRC project is in the works.)  Its unifying theme
is what Dutton calls tele-access: the socially constructed conditions
under which people get access to technology and information of various
sorts.  This includes privacy and data protection, free speech issues,
equity issues of access to technology, and so on.  Although mostly
written by Bill, the book includes brief sections contributed by
people involved in the project. <p>

Richard Hawkins, Robin Mansell, and Jim Skea, eds, Standards,
Innovation and Competitiveness: The Politics and Economics of
Standards in Natural and Technical Environments, Aldershot, UK: Elgar,
1995.  This book on standards dynamics is one of several books on the
list from SPRU <http://www.susx.ac.uk/spru/>, a research center at the
University of Sussex which gained fame as the Science Policy Research
Unit but is now called Science and Technology Policy Research.  Like
much SPRU work, this book is based on case studies without presenting
case-study material at great length. <p>

Jens Hoff, Ivan Horrocks, and Pieter Tops, eds, Democratic Governance
and New Technology: Technologically Mediated Innovations in Political
Practice in Western Europe, London: Routledge, 2000.  This is, to my
knowledge, the best book about information technology and democracy.
Although it is an edited book, the chapters result from an integrated
project and the book unfolds more or less linearly.  The strength of
this book, as with much European work about technology and democracy,
is its grounding both in democratic theory and in the practice of
public administration (as opposed to the electoral and legislative
systems).  The first couple of chapters, which are short and dense,
are the best outline of the relationship between various visions of
Internet democracy and the historical philosophies of democracy such
as corporatism and republicanism.  The book is, unfortunately, too
trapped by the cyberspace / virtual-reality theory of politics to
develop a strong alternative theory.  Nonetheless, all paths forward
lead through close study of this book. <p>

The November/December 1999 issue of the ACM Magazine "Interactions",
which is a special issue about an EU research project called Maypole
about family snapshots and their migration to digital media.  The EU
has gone to great lengths to organize international research programs,
and this magazine issue reflects the coordinated nature of the project
in its unified graphic design.  This kind of advanced culture of
collaboration means that the project crosses disciplinary boundaries
in a productive way, for example mixing ethnographic studies of family
snapshots with industrial design studies of products and services that
the families might find useful.  Some details can be found on the Web:
<http://www.acm.org/pubs/contents/journals/interactions/1999-6/#6>.
I particularly recommend Dick Rijken's article, "Information in space:
Explorations in media and architecture". <p>

Toru Ishida and Katherine Isbister, eds, Digital Cities: Technologies,
Experiences, and Future Perspectives, Berlin: Springer, 2000.  The
editors are Japanese and American, and the best chapter is a very
strong theoretical piece by Bill Mitchell (an Australian now teaching
at MIT), but the core of this book is the European civic networking
movement, which has gotten much more support from city governments and
social movements than the stalled community networking movement in the
United States.  Most of the chapters are straightforward descriptions
of the projects, some of which are more real than others.  Still the
overall effect is impressive. <p>

Liberty, Liberating Cyberspace: Civil Liberties, Human Rights and
the Internet, London: Pluto, 1999.  This is a worthwhile book about,
as the title says, civil liberties and human rights issues relating
to the Internet.  The roster of issues will be familiar (copyright,
cryptography, content regulation, etc), and is not much different
in Europe than in the United States.  But the context of the European
and global human rights movement provides a different philosophical
and social grounding to the analysis than the constitutional analysis
in the US. <p>

Robin Mansell and Roger Silverstone, eds, Communication by Design: The
Politics of Information and Communication Technologies, Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1996.  This is another very strong book from SPRU,
largely about the role of political and economic factors in the social
shaping of standards for things like electronic commerce.  What's most
impressive is not so much the daring of their theories but the amount
of case study that the analysis is obviously based on.  Mansell and
Silverstone are both now at the London School of Economics. <p>

Robin Mansell and W. Edward Steinmueller, Mobilizing the Information
Society: Strategies for Growth and Opportunity, Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 2000.  This tome sums up SPRU's EU-funded research
on information society topics for the last several years.  Although
it is consistently worthwhile, it is most interesting on the changing
role of intermediaries in an information-society industry structure.
Everybody knows that the simple story of disintermediation is not
right, and some American research has provided a theoretical basis
for the study of new patterns of intermediation, but it is SPRU
that has done the strongest and most sustained study of real cases.
<p>

Robin Mansell and Uta Wehn, eds, Knowledge Societies: Information
Technology for Sustainable Development, New York: Oxford University
Press, 1998.  This volume, yet another SPRU product, synthesizes a
large-scale collaborative project to provide advice on the role of
information technology in development in the third world.  There's
an immense demand for this information, and this volume gathers all
the weightiest research findings and best common sense in one place.
<p>

Roza Tsagarousianou, Damian Tambini, and Cathy Bryan, eds,
Cyberdemocracy: Technology, Cities and Civic Networks, London:
Routledge, 1998.  This is a more theoretically minded book from the
European civic networking movement, including chapters on projects
from the UK, Italy, Greece, Germany, and the Netherlands, together
with one project from the United States.  It is free of hype of both
the enthusiastic and skeptical sorts. <p>

W. B. H. J. van de Donk, I. Th. M. Snellen, and P. W. Tops, eds,
Orwell in Athens: A Perspective on Informatization and Democracy,
Amsterdam: IOS Press, 1995.  This is a serious and thoughtful book
about ICT's in public administration.  Like the Hoff, Horrocks, and
Tops volume above (not coincidentally also led by a Dutch group),
it brings a deep and sensible knowledge of democratic theory to
bear on a wide range of practical problems of computing in public
administration, such as the involvement of ordinary citizens in
bureaucratic decision-making, access to public information, merger
of data from different sources, and community access to government
through computer networks.  (Wim van de Donk is also the coeditor
with Stephen Coleman and John Taylor of a book that I haven't managed
to get my hands on yet, Parliament in the Age of the Internet, Oxford
University Press, 1999; and the coeditor with Ig Snellen of another
book that has escaped me, Public Administration in an Information Age:
A Handbook, Amsterdam: IOS Press, 1998.) <p>

Jan van Dijk, The Network Society: Social Aspects of New Media,
translated by Leontine Spoorenberg, London: Sage, 1999.  This is one
of the best all-around surveys of social issues raised by new media.
It is thoughtful and clearly reasoned, and it is theoretical without
self-indulgence.  If I were running a class and wanted to get beyond
the tedious arguments between enthusiasts and skeptics, I would
consider assigning this as a text.
