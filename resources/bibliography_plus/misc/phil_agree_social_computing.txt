Books on the Social Aspects of Computing, 1994-1997

Phil Agre

This is the version of 24 August 2002.

This is a bibliography of books on the social, cultural, political, educational, economic, business, literary, legal, and religious aspects of networking and computing that were published in English between 1994 and 1997. I have not included books that are mainly technical, works of fiction, or directories of online resources. Nor have I included the paperback editions of books that were published before 1994. The list is fanatically complete for 1996-1997 and only reasonably complete for 1994-1995. I hope it is useful.

Many thanks to everyone who offered comments on the initial version of this list.
