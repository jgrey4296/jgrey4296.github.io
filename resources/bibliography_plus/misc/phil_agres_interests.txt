What I'm Interested In

This is an alphabetical list of (almost) all of the books that I have found interesting to keep a note about in the last ten years. I do not claim to have read all of these books, but I have at least skimmed a majority of them. Please do not draw any conclusions from the presence or absence of any book in this list. Books are in the list for a wide variety of reasons, and I do not expect to like them all. In particular, I intend many of them as "data" for various research projects, and not as sources of serious ideas. Let me know if you find any errors.
